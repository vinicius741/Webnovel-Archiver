<p class="cnM2NjQ2YzhmNDNlNDRmZmI5YWQwYTgyMGI1NjE4N2Yz"><strong><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Osram Time: 10:10, February 24, 2295</span></strong></p>
<p class="cnM2YjRlODM0NmI4ODRmYzZiMmRjZjExMzMyYmFjODEx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Inner Sanctum, Vault of Primal Urges, Mare Imbrium, Near Side, Osram</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNDgwZjJmODQwYTQ0MTA4M2E3ZTlmM2ZkZTZlZGI2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Prefect, this is nonsense—" Kaori began, but Dilinur cut her off with a sharp gesture.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYjY3NGI5MDJiMjRmN2Y4MzBlYjZmNjg3MmExY2Y2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Kaori, watch our flank. Your Highness, please direct our troops."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNGZlODQxNDhiODRkMzQ4MDQyYjM4YmEyZDc1NzM5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Joon-Seok hesitated, clearly torn. Finally, he nodded, raising his voice despite the pain. "Amber-Eyes, Conjurers, hold position. Bloodtroopers, maintain the perimeter."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZjM1NzVhNGIxYjQ5MzM4NzFjYWZiZTkzN2Q1NDBh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A circle cleared around them as Imperium and Sand Lotus forces withdrew to the edges of the chamber.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMGRjMDJkZTU4NjQ0YjJiMmRjNDNiNDc5NzJmNGRj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"A shame you weren't a Lotus," Amir said quietly as he stepped into the circle, his warstaff twirling in his hands, golden light trailing from its tip. "Few outside Venus recognize the old ways. Fewer still would risk themselves when they command superior numbers."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOTE1NTc4NTc1YjQ5MDBiMzkxYjViN2QzOWFmNDcw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur's Fan snapped fully open. "You speak of freedom while invading territory that isn't yours. Your hypocrisy knows no bounds."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MmE0YzA5Y2I0MzRiZDY5OThmZWZhNTQ1NDk3Zjkx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Sūrya Tāpa!" Amir's first spell came with blinding speed, his staff tracing golden symbols in the air. A wave of Solar energy surged from the ground beneath Dilinur's feet, threatening to engulf her.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NmI4MTkzYzRhZjRlOTlhNTI0ZTEyNDAxMWFmNGI0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Nakha Bandigṛha!" Dilinur countered in Devavāṇī, her Psi Fan sweeping downward. Crimson energy formed into nail-like projections that pierced the rising golden wave, disrupting its pattern before it could fully form.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YmFkYmM3YzRjODQzZTBhZDkzMGMwY2UyNjNlMTE0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Amir looked surprised before focusing again. "Indra Kavacha!" A shimmering violet barrier appeared around him as he advanced, his warstaff a blur of motion.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMzYwZjMxNjI3NDRhYzk5MDlmNjM4ZGQ4YzQ1NGIx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The physical strike came from the left while a second spell—"Agni Prakāśa!"—created a blinding flash of solar energy from the right.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZWU2Y2YzMGU4ZjQ5Mjk5MzQwMmVkNmFjMjc1MWY2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur's Fan snapped upward to block the staff, the impact sending vibrations through her arm, while she turned away from the flash. Even so, spots danced in her vision as she staggered back.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNzM5NjM0MDRmYTQ3M2NiODg2MjNlMzNiZWFjYzkx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Māṁsa Śalya!" she hissed through gritted teeth. Her index finger extended beyond her Fan, a thin crimson spear of energy launching toward Amir's barrier.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YjBlODc5NzRjZTQzYjg5NzBjZmMzMDEyMzNlN2Qw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Blood Finger Spear shattered against his shield, breaking into crimson motes that faded in the charged air. Amir pressed his advantage, staff whirling into a series of strikes too fast to track.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZDQ3NzBhMTBiODRkMzNiZjYzZGNiMGVhYzBhMTFi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Sūrya Vajra!" A concentrated beam of solar energy erupted from his palm between staff strikes.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwN2IyZDQ4OGJhNjRkNjA5ZmQ3NDBlNzdiODI1MzQy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur's Fan opened wider, its silver edges catching the beam. For a moment, the energy hung suspended between them, neither advancing nor retreating. Then her Fan began to glow red-hot from the strain.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNzI0MDEwNzg1YTQ3YzI5Yjc2OWZlZjQ2YmIzNTM2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Impressive resistance," Amir acknowledged, not slowing his assault. "Chandraśila Pravāha!"</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDJjNDgzMDVkNzRiNGE4YTk1MTA5ZTY5MmM5YWQ2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Quantum blue Lunar energy—unusual for a Sand Lotus warrior—rushed from his staff like a tidal wave, threatening to overwhelm her already taxed defenses.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjODZlZDk2NjYxODRhMzViZWFmMGZiMWFhYWVlZjA2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur felt her boots sliding across ancient stone as the force pushed her backward. Her Fan trembled in her grasp, silver edges beginning to warp under the dual assault of heat and pressure.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZWI0N2Q4NzhkMjRlMmQ5OWQ1NzhkYjI1MjM2MGQ3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Around them, both forces watched in stunned silence. Even Shazmeen's projection had stilled, her usual mockery absent as she studied the duel with interest.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NmU1NzQ4Mjc4ODRlMDFhMzFiYTAyZWY2ODBhYWQ5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You fight well, Khatun Altai," Amir called over the roar of energy between them. "But you fight for the wrong cause. The Imperium only values you for what you can give them, not for who you are."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOTdjZWQ0NDdhZTRjODRiMTZiMzRiNWJiMzBkYmMz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Sweat beaded on Dilinur's brow as she maintained her defense. "You know nothing of my reasons!" she countered, though part of her wondered if his words held truth.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZjM4Y2E5ZmFhZDQ4N2VhOTFkOGZjMDFiOThkZTQ3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I know the Imperium sees you as Unblooded," he pressed, circling slowly. His staff swept low, a feint followed by another Solar spell: "Raviprabhā Śakti!"</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOTYxNzZlZGRkYjRmNzZiMGI3YWZjNjViNjdkZjgw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Golden rings of energy cascaded toward her, each one threatening to bind her in place. Dilinur twisted, her Psi Fan tracing complex patterns to disrupt their formation.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OTkzZmNhZTNkOTRjYWRiMzBlZTQ0YTFmMjcyOTZm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Agni Śūla Hana!" Her counter-strike created a scythe of flame that cut through Amir's rings, dispersing them into harmless sparks.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YmU2YjQ3N2VmNTQ1ZGY5ZjZmZWI3NGJiOTQyMTFi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">But he was already moving again, his staff channeling another spell: "Sūrya Pratibimba!" Multiple images of Amir appeared, each one perfectly mirroring his movements, each one advancing toward her from different angles.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NmVlZGMxNDI2MjRiMGFiNGI2YTBmYWJkYjdkZTg0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur's eyes narrowed as she tried to spot the real threat among the illusions. "Your tricks won't save you, rebel scum," she warned, though her breath was coming faster now, her Aether reserves depleting with each defense.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDMzYTQ0MmJiMTQ1NjZiMDQ4YTY5NWY3ZTNlMTdh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">All versions of Amir struck at once, staffs descending in perfect synchronization.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YzA1OTFmZTI1NTQ2MWVhMDcwMDIyNTcwNjRiOGFj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur dropped to one knee, her Fan sweeping in a complete circle above her. "Darpaṇa Māyājāla!" Mirroring her opponent with a Mirage spell, she created a purple dome of reflective energy, momentarily confusing the illusions.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OWZmZGIzNjRmYzRkZTY5YmEyYTQzMmJjOGQ3OGEy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The real Amir remained unfazed as his staff connected with her shield, shattering it in a cascade of silver fragments. Dilinur rolled backward, barely avoiding the follow-up strike. As she regained her footing, she felt warm blood trickling from her nose—a sign of dangerous Aether depletion.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZGYwMjE5ZTFiZDQyOWRhOGYyNGJhMGQ2N2RmYTQw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You're reaching your limit," Amir observed, his breathing still controlled and even. "There's no shame in recognizing when a path leads nowhere."</span></p><span class="cmJiYTkwNmFhOWE2NTRkODg5ZDliNWRhYjBmMWVmMTY2"><br/>This content has been unlawfully taken from Royal Road; report any instances of this story if found elsewhere.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM0ODJjMjNmMTY0MzQyODU4N2QwNWU5ZjFhNmY0NGU0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">His next spell came without warning, a fast surge of golden energy that struck Dilinur squarely in the chest. She stumbled, her Psi Fan nearly slipping from her grasp as pain spread through her body.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNTdhMDM3YjA0OTQ1ZGM5NTY2ZTE3NmU1ODM5NmI1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Why not join the Sand Lotus instead?" Amir pressed, his voice softening. "Help us protect humanity from those who would enslave minds. Your talents would be valued, your heritage celebrated rather than hidden."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNjQxMGE1NzQ2MDRiMThiOGI0Y2U1MDU0OWI1MTRj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur tasted blood as she straightened, her silver fan held before her like a shield. For a moment, doubt crept into her mind. What if he was right? What if the Crystal in Imperial hands meant the end of free will? What if—</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNWEzZDlmNTAwNzRkNWNhMGI4MGUzNjk1NDExNTM3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">No.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOGVmMzkzZjE4NDQ3OGVhOWE1NjZhODAxOGRjMTYw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The hesitation lasted only a fraction of a second, but Amir saw it. His expression softened further, his guard lowering slightly. "You see it, don't you? The truth behind—"</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YjFlMGViYTE0ZDQ5Mjg4YTkzZDIyODMwN2Y0MDEx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Māṁsa Śalya!"</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZTc2ZDZiMmUzYzQ2NmE5Y2UyNmM5NmM1ZWZkMGQz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Another Blood Finger Spear shot from Dilinur's extended index finger with deadly precision, catching Amir in his moment of distraction. It pierced his shoulder, drawing a surprised gasp as crimson energy disrupted his psionic field.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjODU4NjFjMmFlNzRiYjI5YmI4NjBkMDRkMGM2YzBm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur pressed her unexpected advantage, her Fan tracing complex patterns in the air. "Rakta Unmāda!"</span></p>
<p class="cnMyM2QzYWQwMTZjMjRlNDZhNTM1YzAxZmQwYTE2ZTg4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Blood from her nose fed the spell, amplifying its power as crimson energy surged through her body. Her movements became supernaturally fast, her Fan leaving afterimages as she advanced on the wounded Amir.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTk3MDYwM2RiNjQxZmJhNzliMjkxNTgxMzhhNzRl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Agni Śūla Hana!"</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOTQyNWIwYzM5MDQyNWQ5MmM0YWNmZmUwNmUwNDJh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The flame scythe caught Amir across his chest, sending him staggering backward. His warstaff moved to deflect, but Dilinur was already inside his guard, her Fan striking with the precision of a rapier.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNTliZGZmYTk2ZTQyZWY4MzVmYjYwOTc5NzI4M2Yw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Impressive recovery," Amir acknowledged, wincing as he repositioned. "But misguided loyalty. Sūrya Rakṣa!"</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Y2U0ZDc5NDRjYzQxNjM5NGExMGNkZjFlN2U3NGNj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A desperate shield of Solar energy formed around him, but Dilinur's bloodied Fan cut through it like paper. She had found her rhythm now, each strike flowing into the next with deadly purpose.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZjE4MzFjNDQzNTRlZjNhMTcyNTE5MDljMGExYzA5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"My loyalty isn't blind," she countered, her Fan describing another arc. "It's a choice. My choice."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YjU0NzA4MTc5MjQyZmE5ZmM0MzMzOThkODNkYTQ1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Amir attempted another spell—"Chandraprabhā Vāyu!"—but Dilinur's counterattack came faster.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NzJjYmEzZTNmNDRlYzdhMzRlMzIzNGU4NWVmNzFj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Kanta Kajavala!"</span></p>
<p class="cnMzODEwOTgzOGUxYTRiZTZhZjU3NGZhNjk5ZmRkMDk0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Thorny barriers erupted in precise patterns, not to stop him, but to guide his momentum. Amir crashed through them, his balance lost as thorns tore at his robes and flesh. Before he could recover, Dilinur closed the distance, her Fan pressed against his throat.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjdjNjEwNWY5MjQ3ZjU5YzdhYWYyZDJiZjJlZjQ5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yield," she commanded, her voice steady despite the blood trickling from her nose. Around them, both Imperial and Sand Lotus forces had frozen, watching the duel's conclusion with bated breath.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYmQwN2Q2Mjg3MDRjOGU5MDVhYjc0NThhMDAwMDAz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">For a moment, Amir's eyes flashed with defiance. Then, accepting his defeat, he lowered his staff, the golden glow fading as he nodded.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZDE3N2ZlYTE0NzQ5YzY5ZmZlODQyOGRhN2YwZWIz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"By the sacred laws of Shakti Spardhā, I concede," he said, his voice carrying throughout the chamber. "The duel is yours, Khatun Altai."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ODljMDNlYjAxMDQ4YzA4OTE3MmJjM2E2OTMxYjcz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A murmur of surprise rippled through the Sand Lotus forces. Several Krypts tensed, as if ready to rush to their leader's defense, but Amir raised a hand to stop them.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzk2OGYzMzJhNjQ5OGE4Mzk5NjQ5OWE5OTZlZWM2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The terms were clear," he continued, his gaze meeting Dilinur's. "We shall withdraw, as promised."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMjkzNjEyZGIwNjRkY2E4N2UxN2U2YTEwZjc3Mzg5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur's Fan remained steady at his throat. "First, remove the Mark of Torment from His Highness, as agreed."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjUxNzBlODU5YTQ4NGJiMDk2ZWIyZDE4MGNhYTVm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Amir hesitated, his eyes flicking to where Joon-Seok stood watching, his arm still limp at his side. "The Prince has much to answer for. The Mark would serve as a reminder of—"</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YzA4NDNlMjVjOTQ5MWRiNzViNGZhOTFjYzlhM2Iw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The terms," Dilinur interrupted, pressing the Fan more firmly against his skin, "were clear."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NGEyZDRiNTdmMzQ0OWU4MTllMzcyNWQ2MDRjNmUx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">After a long moment, Amir nodded. "So they were." He turned toward Joon-Seok, his staff tracing patterns in the air. "Śānti Mukti Dattvā."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NzM5M2EyMGVlODRjNjU5ODZmZTI1MzMzZjQ0ZGRl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Golden light flowed from his staff toward the prince. As it enveloped Joon-Seok's form, the tension visibly left his features. He flexed his previously injured arm, surprise and relief washing over his face.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMjkxYmRkMmEzMzQ5YmJiMDU1MjBiNTU5ZjNjMDhl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"It is done," Amir said, lowering his staff. "Honor demands I fulfill my part of the bargain."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMzhkMmIyNzliNTRiMzhiZDgyYjRhNzVkMjUzNjQ4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur stepped back, her Fan still ready but no longer threatening. "Then withdraw your forces, as promised."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzN2ZhYjY0YjE3MDRlOTk5ZWEwZGE5MTliNGNjMmI2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Amir's gaze lingered on her for a moment longer. "Consider what I've said, Khatun Altai," he spoke quietly, so only she could hear. "When you stand before the Crystal, ask yourself who should wield such power – and to what end."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYTEyZTRjNjI0MjRiNGNiMDljMTY0ZjBjYWFjMjYy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"That's my judgment to make," she replied evenly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYmE4MDM5ODk3MzRkZmU4OTkwMjQ1MDc4YzY3NmJl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">He raised his voice, addressing his forces: "Vedhs, covering fire! Krypts, extraction pattern!"</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZDhhMmI4ZjNhOTQ1MWFhMGU0MmNiYTYzODY5YmM3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Sand Lotus warriors responded immediately, shifting from offensive to defensive positions. The Vedhs unleashed a sustained barrage, not aimed to kill but to create a barrier of golden energy between the two forces, covering their organized retreat.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZTg3YjMxZTM5MzQ4ZDM4Y2U4NmE1YzQyOTUxNWVh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"They're retreating?" Kaori's confusion was evident as she tried to find an opening through the energy barrier. "Strike Teams, pursue!"</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ODM1MDVkMjMwZDQ4MmViN2MzYTFjODZkNTJiMzNl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"After them!" Joon-Seok's command carried over the chaos, his arm now fully functional. "Amber-Eyes, tracking fire—"</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MjNiYTkxMzgzMjRjN2ViMWYzYmM0MTcwZmIyZWUz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Belay that," Dilinur's voice was steady despite her exhaustion. "They're honoring the terms of Shakti Spardhā. We shall do the same." She felt Kaori's quick glance, measuring. "Your Highness?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNDZmYzlhMmIyNDQ0ZTliYmFlNmZkOTVkYzVjODU5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A moment of tension stretched between them. Then Joon-Seok nodded, his face showing a hint of something. "Very well, Prefect." He turned to the troops, his authority reasserting itself. "Reform ranks. Standard containment protocols!"</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNjdmYmUwNDkwOTQ5NzQ5YzBlZjk0NmNmYzRjYjE5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Shazmeen's projection flickered as she maintained her healing magic. "He may return with reinforcements," she said, her usual mockery tempered by something new as she turned to Dilinur. "If you'll excuse me, Prefect, I'll look into their psionic footprints."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MTIzYThiNjA0YTRhOWM5NTJhMmQ0NzA1ZDU2YWZk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"That would be best." Dilinur's Fan folded as she held it close to her thighs, silver edges catching the vault's remaining light. The blood had begun to dry on her arms, but she could still taste iron at the back of her throat. "Our objective remains the Moondust Crystal."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MjNjMThkMmExZjRkMDBiM2RiMWQ5MWNkNTlhYWFh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As Shazmeen's projection disappeared, the Imperial force reorganized efficiently. Bloodtroopers formed new containment patterns while Amber-Eyes established firing positions. In the distance, the last golden glow of the Sand Lotus retreat faded into darkness.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNDFmNGFmMjgyMjQ2MDg4OGNlM2NkM2UzMDMwNDdk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Teams Dragon and Tiger!" Kaori called out, her daggers gleaming. "Advance pattern, sweep and clear." She glanced at Dilinur, adding: "With the Prefect's permission, of course."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZjdhNzM0MGViZjQ5MGU5NjcxNmMxNjk5ZGQ5OTQ0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur nodded, noting how the other woman's subtle deference carried none of its usual theatrical flair. "Proceed. Conjurers, deactivate barriers. We press forward as before."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjlmYTM0ZDQ1NTQzM2E4MzkwOTE4YzdjNzY3N2Nj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As their forces moved to secure the chamber, Dilinur caught glimpses of strange patterns in the stone itself – geometric shapes that seemed to shift when viewed directly. The air grew thicker, charged with potential that made her Fan vibrate in response.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTI3ZjQzMjA4MDQ0NmRiM2VkNTYzZGI4ODM5ZjVk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Amber-Eyes, check your bolts. We'll be ready for what awaits inside." Dilinur's voice carried quiet certainty as she led them forward. Blood still stained her robes, and her Aether reserves were slow to replenish even as she sipped from her bottle of Indra-Sprite, but her steps remained steady.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZGQ1MzQ0YjFjYTQyNjNiZTI5ZDZmNTg3MDg1ZDI5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Somewhere ahead in those depths waited the artifact that could reshape the balance of power throughout the Five Realms. And despite Amir's warning – or perhaps because of it – Dilinur was more determined than ever to claim it for the Imperium.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YzU5MzYwNWYyNTQyMjA4NGUyMmMyZjhhOTJhNzg2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Crystal would be theirs. Whatever the cost.</span></p>
