<p class="cnMzNzIyMmE5ZWYyMjQ4YTg4MDZiOWZlZTRkNzdhOTYw" style="margin-bottom: 0">Yoda's ears twitched.</p>

<p class="cnMyZmFmMmM2Y2JkODQ3MmZhNTdhODQ4MzU5YTA1Y2Jk" style="margin-bottom: 0">Behind him, the chamber’s metal doors smoothly whispered shut and the footsteps told him that the last members of the High Council had arrived. But he did not turn from the window, not yet.</p>
<p class="cnNhNGQ3MGUxZjE2MjQxOGQ4MjQyMDBjNzlmZDlhODQy" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnNiYWM2MjUzZWRiYzQzYzhiMjFhYjcwNGFlY2NjMDRh" style="margin-bottom: 0">Needed, a moment of quiet contemplation was. Especially for the Jedi High Council, and especially on 'emergency' meetings. No emotion, no passion; only minds at peace and hearts with serenity.</p>
<p class="cnM5NTE4NmI2YmI3NDQwODdiZDQxNzNkMzdiZTlhNmY4" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnNhZjdlNDcxMjUxMjQ1OWU5ZjA3NDRmMDIxN2I4NmQz" style="margin-bottom: 0">Yoda breathed deeply and rested his hands on his cane. He drank in the warm sunset of Coruscant as it filtered through the transparisteel windows, as well as the view of the life on Coruscant. The endless sprawl of towers, skybridges, and hovering platforms stretching toward infinity and all the way down to the planet's surface, and below. Congested air lanes lined the sky overhead like broken grid squares formed with starships, intersections marked by gradually pulsing crimson traffic beacons. And far below, the lower levels lay, their traffic forming luminous golden veins across the sprawling Coruscant metropolis…</p>
<p class="cnM3YjhjNDQ1YzQ3OTQ5YjQ4NDdlZGU2OGZmMTY0OTg0" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnNhNzNlYzhjNjY2MzRjYjliN2MwMDdlYTQ0ODUyMTBh" style="margin-bottom: 0">His thoughts turned briefly to the most likely subject of the coming session and a day not too long ago now when he had asked her thoughts on the vista outside. Yoda saw countless people all gathered together in relative peace and harmony, visible evidence of the endless march of progress that was civilization. He saw Coruscant as the shining jewel of the Republic and an example to the rest of the galaxy. The student in question, however, saw not the vibrant life below and around them. She saw only a barren, bleak cage devoid of nature, with people packed in shoulder to shoulder like livestock. One person’s paradise truly was another’s prison.</p>

<p class="cnMwZGI0N2JjMzAyMDQ2MWRhMGYyMmFhMDI4NWI2ODcy" style="margin-bottom: 0">His ear twitched again as a stray sound clipped right off the green of his skin</p>

<p class="cnNhYjQ2MmEyNWIwZjQwZjNiNjc2MDA5MGIzYTU0MjNh" style="margin-bottom: 0">He could feel the undercurrents of emotion from some of the gathered Masters, shifting in their seats. Some masked their emotions well—Mace Windu’s posture was composed but wary, his faction glancing toward him for unspoken guidance. Others, like Ki-Adi-Mundi, barely concealed his simmering impatience. And then there was Dooku—his former Padawan—who filled the room with his quiet deliberations. Existed, factions always had within the Council, but rarely had they been this distinct. A third of those present clearly knew something the others did not, and judging by the grim set of their features in their reflections on the window, they were far from pleased.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZGI5NTJkNTdjOTRmNjA5NzQ4YzEyMTIyZDAwZThj" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnMzZDA1OTU0YTY2YjRmYTdiN2FlZGM4NjhjMzVlNTZh" style="margin-bottom: 0">Then, with a sharp rap of his cane against the stone floor, he turned, swept his eyes across the council.</p>
<p class="cnM1YmQ2OGEwZjIxMzQzYjFiYjc5M2JkZWY3NmEzNTBm" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnMxMTVmYmVlMzBiMzQxOTY5OTRiMzlkYjM3ZWM2NGIw" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Begin, this emergency meeting of the Jedi High Council shall,” he began, the leather of his chair rustling quietly as he took his seat. “Master Mundi, requested this meeting you did. Have the floor, you do.”</p>
<p class="cnNkYjY2YzNhYzMyZjQ5YjZhYmIzYWViZWJkMjQ1MjBi" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM1ZTY5MDIyYTcyYTRkODg4MGYwZDI5MWEwNjJmZTNm" style="margin-bottom: 0">Mundi nodded, tapping at something on the controls built into the arm of his chair. “First, I would like to read an excerpt of a report for the Council.”</p>
<p class="cnM4NDliNzgyYWQ1ZjQ2NDBhNmQ0MDg2M2NlNzNlZWRl" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnNjNzJkMmE3NDA5MjRjOGJhNDlhNDQ5NGM0MWRlMDE3" style="margin-bottom: 0">Clearing his throat, Mundi began, “‘Detected three enemy scouts monitoring my routine. Confirmed their presences visually. Began planning to infiltrate and eliminate enemy force. Allowed enemy agent to take me hostage and board enemy ship. Confirmed enemy as Death Watch faction of Mandalorians. Death Watch agent attempted highly unprofessional interrogation but failed to basic anti-interrogation tactics. Further questioning on my part confirmed the agent’s identity to be that of Bo-Katan Kryze, sister of Master Qui-Gon Jinn’s primary, Satine Kryze. Ms. Kryze relocated us from Sundari to a camp far on its outskirts. Registered fifty-six Death Watch present as we landed. Disembarked ship with captor and confirmed presence of enemy faction and lack of non-combatants. Confirmed presence of Death Watch faction leader, Tor Vizsla. Vizsla contacted Master Dooku and attempted to ransom me back, in exchange for leaving the planet for an attack on the True Mandalorian and New Mandalorian faction leaders. Spoke with Master Dooku, confirmed approval to defend myself with force.’”</p>
<p class="cnMyNDAxZWFlY2U2MzQwMzZiMzNiNTVmYzhhZjkxMzdi" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM4NmU5MmU1ZWRkOTQ5YjNhYzhkZDYyNDdhNDQzMTY3" style="margin-bottom: 0">Master Mundi paused, looking around the room for a moment. So far, Yoda noticed that practically everyone who wasn’t already in the know was nodding along. They obviously had not put together what was going on and just who had written the report in question—nor Mundi’s play. Yoda, however, <em>had already read the original report</em><span style="font-style: normal"> and spoken with Dooku and Lene about it. </span><span style="font-style: normal">He had even visited Qui-Gon before he left on another mission just to hear his thoughts.</span><span style="font-style: normal"> He knew for a fact what went on between Mandalore and </span><span style="font-style: normal">Serenno. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1NGM2MmIzOTBiMzRmYTg4NmRjNjI2ZDZkZjBhMjFj" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NGYwMjI0MzhhOTQwYjI5MjM0ZWI4ZmFkMGQ5NTg1" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal">Yoda had also been briefed by Dooku privately regarding Tanya. His old padawan was cagey about the details, but he had relayed that Tanya had explained to himself, Qui-Gon, and Sifo-Dyas why she was… </span><em>the way she was</em><span style="font-style: normal"> and that those three trusted her implicitly at this point. Dooku’s advice was to treat her not as a youngling or initiate, but as someone between a </span><span style="font-style: normal">P</span><span style="font-style: normal">adawan and a </span><span style="font-style: normal">K</span><span style="font-style: normal">night who had completed many of her trials in the field—the Trial of Skill, Courage, the Flesh, and Insight at the very least, with only the Trial of Spirit left incomplete. Regardless of what happened here today, Yoda would be recommending Tanya be made Dooku’s </span><span style="font-style: normal">P</span><span style="font-style: normal">adawan—</span><span style="font-style: normal">she was well beyond being an initiate now.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NGVjOTNiYWRkYzQ5MzliMmE1MmMzNDVlNzQ0MGMz" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnNmMzU0OTU2Mjk4YTQ3ZjFhMDRhYmVjZGI1ZjI3ODY1" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal">T</span><span style="font-style: normal">he problem was, while he hid his outward tells and his emotions within the Force, Mundi’s motives were not pure. Yoda knew the man could be blinded by what was right in front of him. The Cerean had a habit of making his mind up about something, </span><em>or someone</em><span style="font-style: normal"> quickly and once he did, not changing his position even if new evidence was presented—preferring to play the long game and then, if someone did something to draw his ire, claim he had been right all along. It was one of the man’s more glaring flaws—that arrogance to believe that he alone was the most intelligent being in the room. In spite of that, he was still one of the better Jedi Masters in the order at the moment.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTU4MGJkYzM4OTRlZDliNjFkN2QzZjY5NGZjZWE1" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnNlMzEwZjMwODRlZDRlOTY5ZTc3NzZjN2U0MWYwOGE0" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal">Yoda could understand why Mundi felt the way he did about Tanya. A youngling should never have to take a life, and one who did so easily was concerning. However, taking what Dooku, </span><span style="font-style: normal">Qui-Gon,</span><span style="font-style: normal"> and Lene </span><span style="font-style: normal">all</span><span style="font-style: normal"> said </span><span style="font-style: normal">about her</span><span style="font-style: normal"> into consideration—</span><span style="font-style: normal">and Tanya’s own answers to previous questioning—Yoda found his concerns lessened somewhat. </span><span style="font-style: normal">The girl did what she </span><span style="font-style: normal">believed</span><span style="font-style: normal"> was necessary and those actions to date had been justified—and decisiveness, </span><span style="font-style: normal">when it was appropriate,</span><span style="font-style: normal"> was a trait to be lauded within the Order, not scorned or punished. </span><span style="font-style: normal">Likewise, while she clearly enjoyed combat and felt justified in taking a life if she must, she was not sick—she did not take joy in the suffering of others.</span></p>

<p class="cnNhNzJlY2QxMmJiNTQ4NzdiNjI4MjBiOWRjNjYzNThm" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal">Once again, Mundi paused and looked around. “I’ll repeat that.</span><em> Forty dead</em><span style="font-style: normal">, the rest either</span><em> maimed</em><span style="font-style: normal"> or wounded.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZWVjZTFlYjk5NDQ1MjQ4ZWFiMzc4NGUzNDk4Mzkw" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnNmMjhjMmQ5OWRmZjQyZWY5YTkwZjA1OGU1MzFlZTMz" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<span style="font-style: normal">I fail to see the problem,” Master Windu shook his head. “It sounds </span><span style="font-style: normal">to me like</span><span style="font-style: normal"> the mission was a </span><span style="font-style: normal">resounding </span><span style="font-style: normal">success.”</span></p>

<p class="cnMyNzBiMDg1NjI4NDRiM2FhMjI3MTY2Njg1ZGZiYjdm" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Perhaps you’ll change your mind when you see it for yourself,” Master Mundi sneered, touching a control on the arm of his chair. In the center of the room, the holo projector sprang to life.</p>

<p class="cnNiYzVmOGEyYzQ0YzQ5N2JiMjIyMzc4OGQ1NWFkNTgx" style="margin-bottom: 0">Yoda watched in silence as, in the hologram, the events of the report Mundi had just read played out. Yoda had to admit, watching from the perspective of those on the receiving end of <em>Tanya</em><span style="font-style: normal">, the footage was rather damning. Had she acted within the limits and by the code of the Jedi? Perhaps. It was hard to truly say without having been there.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MjAzMjE4NzZkYzRhZTg5Y2RlYzg2NWQwZTQ1ZDg0" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM3MzRkNjM0ODY3NjRhNmM4ZmU0ZmNkNjlkMjI4NWE1" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal">However, if there were truly some great darkness within the girl, the capacity to truly become a Sith, they would have sensed it by now. Yoda had seen her in passing since her return from Serenno and, as ever, while there was darkness inside of her there was also light in equal amounts. </span><span style="font-style: normal">Nothing had changed, there.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMjA1NWVjNDZjZjQ1MDlhY2Y3OGJkNjc3ODJiMDYz" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM1Y2I2MjEzY2E4MjQxMjZhMTE5NjdjZGZiYWZkMTM4" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal">Unfortunately, it seemed that many of the Council didn’t share his opinion—and judging by the way </span><span style="font-style: normal">Master </span><span style="font-style: normal">Mundi’s lips threatened to twitch into a grin, he had counted on that. </span><span style="font-style: normal">His gaze turned to Dooku, fixing him with an irritated look through the hologram, and in that moment Mundi did smile—a look that said he had won. But in his supposed victory, his control slipped, exposing his emotions to the Council. In the sudden upset over Tanya’s actions on camera, they would normally have been lost, but Yoda had been watching and waiting patiently for just such an opportunity.</span></p>

The Council chambers fell silent as everyone seemed to hold their collective breath. </span><span style="font-style: normal">After a moment of silence, Yoda broke it. “Much fear do I sense in you, Master Mundi.”</span></p>

<p class="cnM4MTNmMDA2ZjllOTQ3ZDBiNmFlYzNmMjk0YmM2OGY5" style="margin-bottom: 0">I waited calmly as the projection of Ajunta Pall stared at me. Finally, he chuckled, then shook his head. <em>“Somehow, you keep surprising me, Keeper. </em><em>Most impressive.”</em> When I simply waited, he continued. <em>“Very well.

Anger is just as natural as any other emotion, but you must be careful with its use in fueling the Force, lest it cause unintended harm. Also, if you find yourself fighting a Sith, they will most likely be fueling their own Force techniques with anger and hate, and will have years of experience on you in doing so, and in avoiding the pitfalls that can come from fighting angry.

It is tangentially related to the dark side ability Force Drain, which drains the life energy or bio-electric energy of a target, but is neutral in the Force.

Moving closer feels like passing through multiple layers of veils hiding the area within. They’re light at first, barely noticeable and easily seen through, but they grow heavier and harder to see through the deeper one goes. Until finally, here in the temple itself, it feels like a heavy veil wrapped around my eyes, cutting off much of my Force senses outside the temple.

He could sense the other Masters’ curiosity at the technique, but a gesture from him silenced them.</span></p>

Occasionally, if necessary, she would </span><span style="font-style: normal">take out her personal holocom and attach a data drive to it, before connecting the device to the room’s own holographic display to show footage where it was available, or sensor readings pulled from various ships, droids, and other sources.

We crippled a threat not just to the other Mandalorian factions, but to the greater galaxy, since the stated goal of the Death Watch was a return to the ‘good old days’ of the Mandalorian Crusades—and left them in a poor position to recover from the blow stuck them as the other Mandalorians hunt them down. We’ve secured peace for at least as long as Satine reigns, while they focus on rebuilding their devastated worlds and building up defense forces to handle pirates and other local threats.”</span></p>

At the same time, Tanya pulled a lightsaber hilt from her belt. The man pulled his own lightsaber as Tanya… turned away from him and strode towards Yoda, stopping only a few feet away.
