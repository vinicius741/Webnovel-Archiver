<p class="cnM5ZjVkZGEyM2FhYjQ5ODU5OWRiYzgyZWUyYWE4MmNl">Hey, guys,</p>
<p class="cnM5MThlMzZmZjkzNTQyZDliMGZmYjc5ODliNjg2Njg3">Yeah, it's happened. That next chapter is supposed to come out today, at this exact time, but now you might be staring at this page, wondering why.</p>
<p class="cnMwNjg1NWNmZDAwNTRjNzQ5MDBiZWNjOTAwYWEyMWU2">Long story short, it'll be delayed by one day - coming <span style="color: rgba(185, 106, 217, 1)"><strong>tomorrow (4/26)</strong></span>.</p>
<p class="cnMzZWNhOWZmMDdmYzQ0NjU4NmI3ZjU3OWQxYzQ0NWUw">As it happens, my day job was quite challenging this week. Several pressing projects led to significant overtime for many, myself included. I've been working nearly 12-hour shifts for multiple consecutive days, with sleep often under 4 hours. So, suffice to say, it was a tough week.</p><span class="cjFiNmRiNTg2NDA0ZTRmMmFhOTQ0YWI4ZmQ5YTc5ZjQz"><br/>The tale has been taken without authorization; if you see it on Amazon, report the incident.<br/></span>
<p class="cnMyYTRjNzJjMjg5MDQ3Yjg4MWM1OGNmZjZkOGI5ZmQ2">Now you see where the inspiration for <a href="https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/107092/nucleus-unbound-space-opera-adult-drama-action/chapter/2088354/ch2-xin-i-source-code" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Ch2: Xin I</a> came from, yeah? Art imitating life!</p>
<p class="cnNkOTY0ZGVkZTEzZjRlZmM5YjZjNWU1NDNhZDliMWEx">The good news is the workweek has finally concluded. At present, the next chapter is 60% complete. I'm doing everything I can to ensure all the elements are properly connected so I can deliver it in the best possible state.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZTQ5ZGQwMzZmYjQwNmZhZGEyMjBmM2UzNWVlMzM1">Here's what you can expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="cnNkZjI0MjEwY2FmOTRlNjg4M2U3ODViOTU1MDZmYmVk">It is a Lorna chapter (I know some of you have been waiting for her next installment).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="cnM1NzI2YzczMTAyZTQ1Y2U4ZTBmMGVlMzk3YmYzMWJk">Word count-wise, we're looking at 10,000+ words. It will be divided into 3 or 4 scenes to make it easier to digest.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="cnMyOGUzMjkwMzQxNzQzMzRhMzNiYjMzNzFjNmVkMDgw">Thank you for your patience and understanding. Your support means everything, especially during weeks like this one.</p>
<p class="cnM3NWEzMDM0YTVmYzRlMTg5ZDk5OGI1YmJhODkzMzgw">With that, I'll see you tomorrow, same time.</p>
