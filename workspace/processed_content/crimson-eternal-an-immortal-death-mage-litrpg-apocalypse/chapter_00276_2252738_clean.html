<strong>
    Life and death. Power and Growth. The viewers of the Pioneers donâ€™t care about the end result of any of that.

<strong>
    All they care about is their own entertainment as they watch the Pioneers take the first step into newly initialized worlds on System-based livestreams.
   </strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   On a dark day hated by all citizens of the lower worlds, Aqua finds herself chosen during the Selection Ceremony as one of the next users of their world to participate in the World Expansion. Where she is sent to a newly discovered world just recently initialized into the System to showcase the world on a livestream to the entire Alliance.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   But things take a turn almost immediately as she finds herself awakening not just one but two Bloodlines.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   And once they merge, the Abyssal Kraken takes her first dive into the waters of her new world.

     Join Aqua as she navigates the world of Oceana while dealing with the broadcast constantly following her along the way.
