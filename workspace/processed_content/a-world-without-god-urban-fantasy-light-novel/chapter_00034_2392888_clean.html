   Something as fantastical as teleportation might seem like an extraordinary superpower to humans, but to angels, it was just part of every day life. Every angel must learn how to teleport themselves and others to graduate, and thus be able to partake in missions.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   There were very few physical limits as to where an angel could in theory teleport to—as long as it was a fluid, like air or water, that fluid would be replaced by the teleported object.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As she made the preparations for such routine teleportation, her thoughts suddenly ground to a halt.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <span>
    Teleporting is weird, right?
   </span>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   After all, angels never had to worry about two rigid objects overlapping. If the conditions for teleportations weren’t ideal, then they simply could not do it. The explanation given for such a philosophical question, when posed by the more curious apprentice angels, was that God’s powers within each angel worked subconsciously in mysterious ways. It was like an instinctual level of understanding that their powers would fail.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <span>
    But that can’t be right, so… is the system behind this too?
   </span>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The angel shook her head. Thinking about these matters made her head hurt, so she put this to the back of her mind and teleported away.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Despite the “system” preventing any physical, serious accidents, by the common law, angels couldn’t just teleport anywhere they wished. Over the history of the Upper Realm, a series of rules and infrastructure were established to regulate teleportation.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Given permission from the occupants, you could teleport to the inside of homes and shops. However, it was considered rude and dangerous to teleport into any public space not designated for that purpose, since it could lead to accidents. Therefore, to move around the Upper Realm, angels teleported to specifically designated “teleportation pads” on the side of roads, called
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    autiru.
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   Using these, they “hopped” closer and closer to their destination in a hub and spoke model. The final stretch of the journey was via public transit or walking.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Shiina had been unsure where exactly to teleport to. She was sure Hikari would make her speech from the Central Plaza, the same location that saw thousands of angels pray during the Illumination. The Inner City—the central island, which contained the aforementioned plaza, the Archangel’s Palace, the Sacred Forest and the Shrine—had dozens of these
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    ayutiru
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   . The problem was that Shiina didn’t come from outside the city—she came from its very center—but her clothes were clearly from Earth. When coming from a mission, angels had to perform a “ritual cleansing” of their body and soul. It was especially rude to mingle in the Inner City without performing said ritual.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <span>
    But I don’t have time to do that now, or I’ll miss Hikari’s speech.
   </span>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She would be going against convention, but she had no choice. She would have to take a detour.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Shiina found herself in am
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    ayutiru
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   serving her home base, so to speak—the Japanese Town. This was the location where angels of Japanese ethnicity lived. The entire outfacing architecture was stylized in a traditional Edo style, but adapted itself to the contours of the island, giving the buildings their own unique look that one couldn’t find on Earth. Even from here, she could spot the Great Cherry Blossom tree, the centerpiece of the Japanese Town, standing proudly on the park on top of the main island.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   All around her, other angels teleported into existence, coming from their own missions or elsewhere in the Upper Realm, causing the air to move erratically in gusts of wind around her. The sight wasn’t anything new to the young angel, but now, she couldn’t help but be struck by how
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    normal
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   everything felt.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <span>
    They really have no idea of what just happened…
   </span>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   To them, this was just another day in their grueling lives. Shiina could tell by their faces just how tired they were, and how much they needed some rest. Knowing this huge secret made her feel an emotion she couldn’t precisely describe. On one hand, she felt powerful, more than she ever had in her entire life. On the other, the guilt that she alone had this undeserving privilege ate away at her soul. These conflicting emotions made her freeze where she stood.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Suddenly, Shiina felt a hand on her shoulder, and gave a jolt.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Excuse me, are you okay?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Uh? Huh?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   When she turned around, a young woman she didn’t know was right in front of her with a concerned look on her face.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “You have been spacing out here for a while,” she said with a worried tone. “You know you can’t stay around in the
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    ayutiru
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   , right?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Shiina was so flustered, she didn’t even put on her fake voice. “Oh, I-I’m sorry.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “That’s alright. I was just worried.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “N-nothing’s wrong! If you’ll excuse me…”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Shiina was about to hurry and teleport closer to home, so she could quickly get changed—but she never got the chance to.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She suddenly heard a voice in her mind, one she had heard not that long ago.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Hello, my fellow compatriots. This is Hikari speaking.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Everyone surrounding Shiina stopped in confusion. This sort of wide-reaching telepathic communication was a privilege reserved for the archangels, and seldomly used. Shiina could count on one hand the times she had been on the receiving hand in her life.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Many of you may already know who I am, but if not, I was just another angel like all of you. So I’m sure this communication in itself is leaving many of you confused. But to clear any doubts that might remain—yes, I am an archangel.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A collective gasp was uttered by the entire Upper Realm. No one said a word to each other as their minds processed what was happening.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “As my first official act, I immediately summon every angel to the Central Plaza. There, I shall explain everything clearly and concisely. That is all.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The people around Shiina, including her interloper, we all stunned. But not this singular angel. She didn’t waste a single second, and teleported closer to the Central Plaza, clothing violations be damned. Her quick thinking made her one of the first to get there. As she made the way to the Central Plaza, however, a throng of people steadily joined her. She managed to secure a location very close to the Archangel’s Palace, where, from the highest of its towers, she could see a lone figure. There was no mistaking her navy blue dress and her golden hair.
  </span>

  <span>
   Hikari was about to speak to the masses below.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   In just a short few minutes, the plaza filled with people, reminiscent of that lost time when every angel thought the Illumination was under way. Shiina shook her head, trying to get that image out. Despite the archangel being so far away, she felt that Hikari was looking straight at her. And she could swear she saw the new archangel draw a small smile.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <span>
    How can she see me from there? ...No, wait, I stand out like a sore thumb here.
   </span>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Everyone who got there that quickly had probably been around the Inner City already, and, therefore, were dressed with the traditional robes angels used in the Upper Realm. Shiina, meanwhile, with her knitted sweater and leggings, was probably visible from up there even without considering any angelic powers Hikari had at her disposal.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She could feel her cheeks starting to get hotter, even while the cold air sapped their warmth. To put her mind off of the embarrassing situation, she turned her focus to the people flocking into the Plaza.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   In mere minutes, the place that had been practically empty was now filled with people. Some were wearing the angel traditional robes, but many still had street clothes, clearly having been caught unawares by the announcement.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   When the Archangel’s speech suddenly began, Shiina jolted back to face her. “My fellow angels, those here in front of me in the Central Plaza, and those elsewhere, today I bring you news of a ploy by the former Archangels to destroy this Realm in defiance of God’s will,” Hikari said in
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    Jolasin
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   . “A ploy that I personally discovered and destroyed before it had any chance of bearing fruit.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Hearing these words, the crowd went dead silent. So far, she hadn’t lied. But Shiina knew that wasn’t going to last long.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “The former Archangels lied to you. They lied when they said that faults were caused by angels. And they lied when they said they were not anything to worry about. For you see, they knew from the very beginning that faults were natural occurrences, the fabric of the world being stretched to its limits and that they should be fixed with utmost urgency. But they did not care, because by hiding these things from you, they intended to eventually destroy this world from within.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The crowd collectively gasped.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <span>
    So that’s what she’s going with?
   </span>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “At some point, the Archangels turned to evil and strayed from God’s instructions. They wanted to see this world slowly consumed by the faults until nothing remained. They were deviants that sought nothing but their own pleasure of destruction.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “But fortunately, by sheer coincidence, I got aware of this ploy. And that was because a couple of human children managed to come into contact with another angel.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Here, the crowd erupted into low whispering.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Who could be so irresponsible?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Such an angel should be banished!”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Shiina felt everyone’s eyes were on her. She began sweating and almost had a panic attack—but she had the presence of mind of using her powers
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    on herself
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   . She might not be able to change her personality just yet, but she could reasonably control her own emotions and steady her thoughts.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   When she did, Shiina realized the situation wasn’t nearly as bad as she first thought.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <span>
    Calm down. Hikari didn’t mention any names. They have no idea who this other angel was. I’m safe.
   </span>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Yes, such a situation would normally be punishable by banishment. But, in this case, it was a blessing in disguise. For had it not been for those two meddlesome humans and that angel that was too kind, I would never have gotten aware of the Archangels’ ploy. As soon as I became aware of it and realizing the little time we had left, I decided the only way to solve this was to contact God directly.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Directly? But how?” Some people asked.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “She didn’t…”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Hikari certainly couldn’t hear the crowd’s comments, but she somehow predicted they would be made, and responded accordingly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Yes, exactly like some of you might be thinking. I went to the Shrine behind this Palace.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The crowd had been enthralled by Hikari’s speech, but after hearing this blasphemy, the mood began shifting against her. After all, going to the Shrine was a privilege reserved only for the archangels. Hikari, being a normal angel then, had no business being there. This was a violation of everything angel society stood for.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “I assure you, it was the only way to resolve this situation. And inside the Shrine, I was able to come into contact with God and explain the situation. And God listened to me, a lowly angel, and understood my concerns.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   This was such a foreign concept to all angels that the mood shifted completely against Hikari. But she wasn’t done with her story yet.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “After leaving the Shrine, the other angel on my side and I got viciously attacked by the Archangels! They intended to banish us right then and there. But I managed to fend them off for just long enough for God to intervene and eliminate the threat of the Archangels.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The crowd was silent. They all seemed to be collectively thinking how it was possible that Hikari, a single angel, could hold off the three Archangels at once.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “God… was angry and disappointed.” She made a meaningful pause to make sure her words reached everyone. “Because of their meddling, God’s plan for this world is now ruined.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The crowd collectively gasped. After all, their sole reason for existence
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    was
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   to implement God’s plan. And now, it was all for nothing?
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “What’s going to happen to us…?” Someone asked.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Oh God Almighty, please have mercy!”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A wave of emotions washed over the crowd like a tsunami. Confusion, panic, acceptance—everyone reacted slightly differently. Sensing this, Hikari spoke above everyone, with the strength of a ruler.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “My fellow angels, fear not. This shall not be the end of our service just yet.” The crowd subsided, latching onto the small lifeboat Hikari had thrown their way. “God is benevolent. Despite this world not following his plan anymore, he shall not punish anyone other than those He already has.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “From this point on, this world shall be developed on its own, without his directives. Our sole mission is to keep fixing faults and allow the world to heal.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The angels breathed a collective sigh of relief.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Eventually, when new godly power sprouts in this world, the Illumination shall occur. God left me in charge of overseeing the transition to this new plan for us and the world. I shall be personally responsible for appointing new archangels and making sure all the errors of my ancestors are corrected.” She made a pause to garner the crowd’s mood. “And that is how I got here, speaking with you.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Everyone in the Plaza turned silent. Even this watered-down, distorted and innocuous version of events was hard for them to handle. Seeing the crowd’s lack of reaction, Hikari gently floated down from the tower. Just like a goddess incarnate, the crowd made way for her touchdown as she landed in front of the Archangel’s Palace. Shiina was one of those people right there in the front seats, witnessing the birth of a new era for the Upper Realm. Hikari looked around herself, her placid, angelic smile shared equally among her subjects. But when she spotted Shiina, the younger angel could once again swear she could see her smile get just a bit stronger.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Now, everyone. As my first command after becoming an archangel, I request that every angel currently on a mission that does not involve a fault in some way to immediately wrap-up in a way that does not leave any lasting consequences. I also request every angel working directly under the old archangels to immediately come to the Palace for an audience with me.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Before Hikari had a chance to return inside the Palace, someone in the crowd spoke above everyone else. Before anyone had noticed, the mood had shifted once again.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Bless the new Archangel! The savior of all Angels!”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The rest of the crowd erupted as if they were waiting for this exact moment. “Bless her!”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   With a final look at the ecstatic crowd, Hikari returned inside with elegant steps while the Plaza chanted in one collective voice. All, except for one lone woman, who decided that there was no point remaining there any longer. She had seen all she wanted to see. The only thing left in her wake was a short breeze as she disappeared from view.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Shiina was tired.
  </span>
 </p>
