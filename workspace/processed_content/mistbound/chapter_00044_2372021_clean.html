<span>
   “Well, this isn’t great.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Master of the understatement as always, Dan.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Dan didn’t bother to respond to Frankie; the two of them, along with Peter and Ernesto, had been forcibly detained by the ZRC and taken into underground cells beneath the ZRC headquarters. Thankfully, the goons that had taken them hadn’t thought to try to strip Dan of the contents of his many pockets, so the alchemist had
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    some
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   options. Just not many, and even fewer if he wanted to actually survive the attempt. A lot fewer. None, actually.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   He was still workshopping it.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Poor Peter was sitting and huddling in the corner of his barebones cell, muttering. Dan felt bad for him; the boy didn’t deserve this, not one bit, and there was absolutely nothing he could do. Every cell was designed for one person, with an uncomfortable bed and a toilet, and nothing else. And it was cold down here on top of that - definitely designed for a miserable experience.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Ernesto, by contrast, had fallen into a meditative state an hour ago. Dan had his suspicions on what the necromancer was doing, but he dared not voice them. They’d discussed branching into
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Spirit
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   -concept spells, and this matched Ernesto’s description. He hoped the mage succeeded, but honestly had no idea what kind of impact it would have.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Dan sighed. “At least I can mark another thing off my bucket list.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Frankie stared at him, her eyebrows reaching her hairline. “What? Getting arrested?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Dan ignored her - there was no need to tell her that he’d always been a bit curious about being locked up. Then she’d ask why, and explaining it just felt like it would lead to a stupid conversation he’d rather not have.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   And besides, it was fun leaving them in the dark. The expression on Maeryn’s face when he checked off “engage in piracy” off his list had been exquisite. “The question is, how do we get out of here… preferably without being maimed…”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “You’re never going to talk to me about your bucket list, are you?” Frankie shook her head and let out a breath before visibly refocusing. “Are you sure you don’t have the key to your cell in your infinite pockets?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “My pockets aren’t infinite,” Dan grumbled. “They’re not some grab-bag that I can just magic whatever I need out of. More’s the pity. Would make my work so much easier.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Way to break the illusion. I thought for years that’s exactly how it worked. I mean, I’m pretty sure you have my hairbrush in there.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Oh, yeah. Right here.” Dan reached into a pocket on his left pants leg and tossed the hairbrush in question back at Frankie absently.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “You’re just proving my point. Wait, how do you even
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    have
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   this? I used that hairbrush in my room this morning! And I’m sure you haven’t been in there since! How did you even?!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Dan denied, electing to examine the iron bars of his cell door.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Sure you don’t.” Frankie sighed. “Alright, you don’t have the cell key. Do you have super-concentrated acid to melt the bars?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “No. I could make some, but the fumes would kill us before we ever got to use it.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “What about a potion of strength so we could literally tear them off the hinges?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I have the ingredients, but that requires a flame and a week to prepare.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “And you don’t just keep one of them on hand?” Frankie asked incredulously. “That sounds like something we should always be carrying!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “You’d think, but strength potions have a poor shelf life. They only last a couple of days.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Guess that makes sense…” the engineer grumbled. “What about a shrinking potion so we can slip through the bars?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Doesn’t exist, though not for lack of trying. The square-cube law is a bitch.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “How about a welding torch? You got one of those?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Dan paused. “Maybe? One sec, let me check.” He patted his pockets, checking the contents of a few of them. “Sorry, no, left it on the airship.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Blight,” Frankie swore. “Alright. What about transmutation? Can you turn this iron into, I dunno, salt or something?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “If there was enough mana, then I might be able to make that work,” Dan conceded. “Iron to a softer metal, anyway. Salt would cost
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    way
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   too much. But it’d still cost less mana to heat the iron to the point where it can be easily bent.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Well, can you do
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    that
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   then?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Nope. Not enough mana for that either.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Ugh.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Then a new voice cut in, one that neither Dan nor Frankie recognized: “You could freeze the metal, and make it brittle.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Dan looked over at Ernesto, who was slowly getting to his feet. Standing in front of him, outside the cell… was a ghost. The figure was a light, pale blue, translucent - Dan could see Ernesto
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    through
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   the ghost - but apparition stood with an intangible poise that suggested that he’d been trained in fighting in life.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Keith Laurant,” Ernesto greeted calmly, though there was a slight tremor in his voice that hinted at the gravity of the moment. “It’s… good to see you again.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Likewise, young Ernesto,” the ghost replied calmly, his tone surprisingly warm for someone who had once tried to kill him. “It seems you have encountered some trouble. You have done well to summon me.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Dan let out a low whistle. “Finally worked out that
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Summon Spirit
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   spell?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Ernesto let out a weak chuckle. “Yeah. It just… I don’t know how to describe it. There’s some element of actual, real need in the spell. Without it, the spell doesn’t work. I didn’t realize it until just a bit ago.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Keith snorted. “Of course the spell has an emotional component behind it. How else are you going to draw a spirit to you? It’s not as though you can offer material possessions to the dead.” He paused to consider his words. “Actually, there might be some spirits you could offer material possessions for… Come to think of it, if you have any good books, that would work fine as an offering for me in the future.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Ernesto’s lips twitched in amusement. “I’ll remember that. Next time I’ll have a book for you.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The ghost actually rubbed its ethereal hands together in excitement, much to Frankie’s disbelief. “Excellent. Now then, on to business. What can I do for you, Ernesto?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I need assistance getting me and my friends out of here,” the necromancer replied steadily. “I can use
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Chilling Touch
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   , but it’s not nearly as refined as yours was - it probably won’t be cold enough. As a ghost, your… body, I guess? Your body should naturally super-freeze anything that stays in your body for a time. Beyond that…” Ernesto looked at Keith hopefully. “I’d love to hear more tips from an accomplished necromancer. I have a ton of questions.”
  </span>
</p>
<span>
<br/>
  This content has been misappropriated from Royal Road; report any instances of this story if found elsewhere.
  <br/>
</span>
<p>
<span>
   Keith smiled at him. “I’d be delighted to assist.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “You’re a… a
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    necromancer
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   ?” Peter whispered hoarsely, and everyone living froze in place. Dan belatedly remembered that Peter hadn’t been let in on that secret yet, and swore under his breath. “
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    That’s
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   your tragic backstory?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Ernesto looked at him with a weak smile. “Yeah,” he admitted softly. “That’s my tragic backstory. A necromancer who doesn’t raise Undead. This is my first time working with a ghost, too.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Peter’s eyes were wide as he stared at Ernesto, his face twisting with fear and apprehension. “Then… then what
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    do
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   you do with your magic?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Ernesto shrugged. “I make cheese.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “You… make cheese?” Peter’s jaw dropped, and he looked absolutely stunned.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Yes, I make cheese. Why is everyone always so surprised when I say that? Necromantic mana rots things, cheese is made with fermentation, it’s really quite obvious! Not everything about a necromancer has to be all death and creepiness! Listen, can we talk about this later? I need to break us out.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Dan stepped in, casting a nervous glance toward the hallway. “Yeah, we’re still in cells here, people. Ernesto, Keith, the bars please? Peter, we’ll fill you in on all the weird details once we’re safe, okay?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Peter nodded slowly, still processing what he’d just learned. “Right. Sorry. Just… necromancy? I never would’ve guessed.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Keith was looking at Ernesto in surprise as well. “I never considered making cheese while I was alive… do you suppose you could make wine, too?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Sure. That’s just fermented grapes, right? I just haven’t yet, because I’m still young enough that people would ask questions,” Ernesto answered distractedly, already focusing on the bars.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Keith stared at him for a long moment, then burst out into ethereal laughter, bending over at the waist. “My… my family…!” he wheezed - quite an odd sound, coming from a ghost. “I could have been the greatest host of all time! Custom cheese and wine pairings! It would have been glorious! And my cousins used me for something as banal as killing people!” He wiped a spectral tear from his eye as he straightened up. “Oh, I cannot wait to see how you turn out, Ernesto. Just give me a minute and I’ll have you right out.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   He immediately turned and glided through the bars in front of Ernesto. Just as the necromancer had hoped, the bars immediately began to frost over, with tiny cracks and pops as ice manifested against the bars only to immediately melt and refreeze under the ghost’s unnatural chill. Quickly, the frost began to emanate from the bars themselves where they hit the floor and ceiling, creeping out with tiny crackles of sound.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Ernesto’s breath came out like fog as the ambient temperature rapidly dropped, and Dan repressed a shiver. “Not yet,” Dan warned as the necromancer began winding up to charge at the iron bars. “The temperature that iron goes from ductile to brittle depends a lot on its alloy, but…”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Translation, please?” Frankie interjected.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Dan scowled. “It’s not cold enough to shatter instead of bend yet,” he summarized shortly, grumpy from his attempt at educating everyone being interrupted. “I’m assuming this isn’t pure iron, so it shouldn’t be too much longer, though.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “How under the sky do you know these things?” Peter demanded.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I’m an alchemist. I read, I know things, and I play with magic. It’s what I do.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “And he’s real good at it, too,” Frankie added. Dan felt a smidgeon of his annoyance fade away at her backing him up, and he returned his attention to the iron bars and the temperature of the air.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Now?” Ernesto pleaded, rubbing his hands together - it was getting frightfully cold, and he was starting to shiver.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Almost…” Dan replied lowly, extracting one of his more precise thermometers for colder temperatures from one of his pockets and holding it in the air, reading it carefully. “Almost… Now!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Ernesto took a deep breath, took a few steps back into the back of his cell, then shoulder-charged the door. Keith drifted gracefully to the side at the last moment, and the section of iron that Ernesto impacted tore itself away, cracking and shattering in places, leaving a hole easily big enough for Ernesto to climb through.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Then Ernesto was out, and he huffed under the exertion, clutching his shoulder. “That… didn’t feel good,” he admitted. “But I’m out.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Frankie clapped her hands slowly, duly impressed. “Science for the win!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “But it was done with magic?” Peter questioned.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “But the magic was used to apply science,” Dan pointed out.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Magic and science for the win!” Frankie compromised with a grin.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Ernesto let out an unwilling chuckle at that. “Alright. Who’s next?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Me,” Dan stated firmly. “I’m stronger than I look, and you’ve more than proven yourself. Just sit back and rest a minute.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Ernesto nodded wearily, and sat down against the wall. “Yeah, okay. Keith, do you mind?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Leave it to me,” the ghost replied, the warmth in his voice at odds with the devastating chill it was applying.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   They repeated the effect three more times, with Dan providing the force courtesy of a hammer he pulled out of a pocket - “And you didn’t share that before I used my own body?” Ernesto demanded in disbelief, much to the alchemist’s sheepish embarrassment - and finally, all four of them were freed.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “N-now w-what?” Peter asked, shivering in the arctic temperatures that Keith had generated. Frankie was no better, huddling next to him for warmth, and Dan couldn’t blame either of them. The only one who seemed to have adapted to the unholy cold was Ernesto, and Dan could only chalk that up to some weird mana interaction between him and Keith.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maybe, since the cold was a direct product of Keith’s spectral presence, and Keith was only manifesting by the necromantic power invested by Ernesto, the cold still retained some of Ernesto’s mana, leaving him somewhat resistant to it?
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Dan grimaced, mentally shaking himself. He could theorize later. Right now was escape time. “Now we get out of here. Up the stairs, take out the guards, and make a run for it. Once we’re outside…” He hesitated.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Terrance and Maeryn aren’t here,” Frankie said quietly, rubbing her arms rapidly in an attempt to stay warm. “Keith, would you take a message to them? Tell them to meet us somewhere?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Keith looked to Ernesto with mild confusion on his face, before he seemed to realize something. “Ah! Young master, you said before that this was your first time working with spirits. I take that to mean you have not learned
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Spirit Walk
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   yet?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Ernesto frowned. “I’m… not familiar with that spell, no.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “It is not too difficult to learn,” the ghost assured him. “I would be happy to teach you. It would effectively allow your spirit to leave your body for short periods of time. In this form, you should have the capability of transmitting your presence to other people, so long as there is a bond - either physical, emotional, or spiritual - that you can tap into.” He nodded to himself, satisfied with his explanation. “You slew me alongside Captain Maeryn and Terrance. You should be able to use my spirit as a conduit to reach them quickly. At that point, you can tell them yourself.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Oh! Well, that’s actually quite convenient,” Ernesto agreed, surprised. “Where should we meet up, do you suppose?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “The airfield’s being watched,” Dan mused, thinking hard. “The Council of Winds HQ is out of the question. It’d be stupid to go back to the hotel. Where…?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “There’s a park about three blocks away from the airship academy,” Frankie declared, talking over the alchemist. “Skyflower Park. Have them meet us there. We’ll do our best to stay as long as we can. If we miss each other tonight, we’ll try again tomorrow night.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Right. That works. Skyflower Park,” Ernesto repeated, committing the name to memory.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   After a moment of silence, Dan cleared his throat. “Alright people. No sense wasting time. Let’s get moving.” They began hurrying up the staircase. Much to all of their relief, the air quickly began to warm up, though it remained unnaturally cooler than it had been when the group was first escorted to their cells.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “By the way,” Dan asked quietly to Frankie. “How do you know about Skyflower Park?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “S-shut up,” Frankie muttered, looking away.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Dan looked at her out of the corner of his eye. Her cheeks were already flushed from the cold, so he couldn’t be sure, but… amusement bubbled up in his gut, and his lips twitched upwards. “Did you go on a date through the flowers, Frankie?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Shut up!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “So you do have a girly side,” Dan continued to tease, keeping his voice low enough that Peter and Ernesto couldn’t hear it. “Never thought I’d see the day.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I swear to the Unending Depths, if you don’t shut up…!” Frankie threatened.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Dan just smiled at her. “I’m happy for you.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Several seconds later, as they approached the top of the stairs, Dan barely heard his friend whisper her response: “... Thanks.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Dan reached out to open the wooden door at the top, but Ernesto grabbed his arm, stopping him. “Wait a second. Keith?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The ghost, who had been casually floating above them the entire trip, nodded gravely. “As you wish.” He vanished from sight, and the hair on Dan’s neck stood straight up as he felt the rush of cold air from the phantom’s passing.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The wooden door audibly creaked as frost erupted from the point that Keith passed through, and groaned as the ghost returned. “You should go now,” Keith reported, immediately returning to visibility. “It appears that young Maeryn has taken offense to you being taken, and is waging a one-woman war in the lobby.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   For a moment, there was stunned silence. Then Dan burst into laughter, the mix of relief and the absurdity of the situation turning his chuckle into a maniacal cackle. “Of course she is. That’s Maeryn for you. Come on!” He wrenched open the door and dashed through, his companions hot on his heels.
  </span>
