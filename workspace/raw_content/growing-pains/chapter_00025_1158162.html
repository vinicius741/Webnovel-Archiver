Pretty, but not what I was interested in.</span></p>

Probably shouldn’t say that out loud though – that were either looking at the surroundings, watching me, or glancing at the hugging pair.</span></p>

I am Queen Hippolyta.” Despite looking like Wonder Woman’s older sister, Wonder Mom really nailed the mom tone. Calm, patient, and just the slightest hint of an iron will of control hiding under the surface…she was pretty cool.</span></p>

The bread was nice and fluffy with a crunchy exterior and a bunch of things baked into it that made it more interesting than just being flour. There was some kind of leaf thing that was stuffed with meat that was pretty tasty, too small though. I had to eat two or three at a time to really enjoy them. But that was fine, it went really well with a salad that was basically just rough cut veggies and cheese. Good cheese too. Though it didn’t mix super well with the fish thing they brought out. Oooh, they had a lamb dish too. And a whole cow! Man, I should have come to Themyscira earlier, they really knew how to welcome someone!</span></p>

<p class="cnNhMTJkNzcyNDUzNTQ2MzNiNjY2NjhkZjg1ZjQ3OTBj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Not that I managed it that well. Mel was like a slightly stronger, faster Batman. Definitely superhuman, but not by a huge amount. But she made up for that with pure skill. She knew exactly how to move to control the pace of the fight, and she wanted it to end fast but also to make it hurt.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDc0ZDM1MGZhMTQ0NzZiYmY4NWNiNjUyOTgxOWFm"> </p>
<p class="cnNlMmM5YWEzNTEwMjQ0NmY5ZjcwZTA5YzIwMjc0ODE0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Unless I wanted to cheat and just start moving faster than her, I was going to keep getting pummeled without being able to do anything back.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNDM1MTYzNjhhMzRkMWJhMzBmYWM1ZmY5MDg0MWMy"> </p>
<p class="cnMyNTA0MDkxMTUxNDQ5NGE4Yzc4ZjRhZWU0YWQ0NjE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">She was going to be so much fun to fight later, but first I had a bet to win.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MTU1ZDQzN2Q4MTQ1NWY5MWY4YmRlMDZhMWZlMjdk"> </p>
<p class="cnNlOGRiZTFlY2JmYzQzNTBhYzU2NGQ5ZTI1Yzk2YTU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">I dove out of the way of a grapple and turned to see Mel standing there with a smug look on her face.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MTk0MjdiZWE1MzQ5N2VhMWU5OWFiNTQ1ZWM1ZTA0"> </p>
<p class="cnMyNmEzNTlhMWJkMjQ1MjNiNjlkYzZjNmY2NGVjOWIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">That was fine, I thought, settling into a stance. I already won.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZTdmZmM5MDE2ZTQwNDRiOTE0NGExZDdlNzNiNDkx"> </p>
<p class="cnNiOThjNTcxM2VkNzQzNDlhZTI0ZjI3YzdlYjU4ZmY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s the matter? Running away won’t help - guh!” Mel’s taunt was cut off when my Ki flared up into a visible aura. The ground shook lightly and the sudden wind made her stumble half a step.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkODM4NzU4YzE5YTRjZjhhM2JkZTEyMzYyNDJjNTY2"> </p>
<p class="cnNiNzNmZDM5NjhjOTRjMGQ4ZGIxN2M4MjllZGNjMjI3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I pushed my Ki higher.</span></p>

<p class="cnNkMGI5NWI1YmYxZTRhMWJiMDczMzM1ZDI5MjhiYTI5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A little wind won’t be enough!” Mel shouted, slowly stepping closer and raising an arm to shield her eyes and stop her hair from whipping her face.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZWRkOGUwZDg4MTRlZTJiNTc1ZTc2NDNiNTYxOWNl"> </p>
<p class="cnMxZjU5MDAwMGRmYjQ1YWI4ZWQzODdlZmRjMDE1OGYx"><span style="font-weight: 400">I said nothing. I just focused on collapsing all my Ki into a little point centered on my chest and then with a mighty yell, forced it all out again in a bright flash that caught Mel by surprise, and more importantly, sent her flying out of the ring.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOGNiZjUzZmNiMDQ0ZDI5ZmM0NjQ3ZWY2NGQxZDc1"> </p>
<p class="cnM0YWU2NDQ0MDYxMTRlZTk4MDFhZjFkOGYwZjYzOTk0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Victory!</span></p>

<p class="cnNiZmM4ZjQ0MDY2MzRhNzY5ZDVmZDIzY2U0NjczODkw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Now to get her to teach me how to move like that…</span></p>

<p class="cnNiM2YzYjlmN2YyNDRkMTM5MjhlOTA5ZDcyZjUzOGQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">From a distant lookout, Queen Hippolyta and Diana watched as the Saiyan girl began to pester Melanippe until the Amazon gave up and started showing her and correcting a handful of strikes and stances she had used in the brief fight.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YTkzNTk4MGVjOTRmNWFhMzllYzdiY2IzYzVmMzg3"> </p>
<p class="cnM1OGI0N2E1MjYxNjQ5ZjBiYWEyODYwM2FlYjNhNDE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It seems that matter is settled then.” Hippolyta murmured.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YWE3MzdkYjMwZTQxZDJhNWJiM2E5NjE3MmMyNmE4"> </p>
<p class="cnNkNWY2OTIyNzJhYjRkN2NhNGM0YTFiZmJiZGJmYmUx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t understand why you assigned Melanippe as Califa’s teacher if she was so against it.” Diana commented. “There were plenty of others that were willing to take her as a student.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOTQ0OGNhN2YxYjQxY2Q5NzNlMjZjZmFiZmVkNzdh"> </p>
<p class="cnNmNTljYWI2MTc1NjQzMmU5YTllYzFmZTEyMzNiN2Ni"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Queen hummed. “There were others, yes. But aside from Melanippe being as good or better than all of them, there was another reason.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYzdiNzg0OTc0ODQ2M2Y5YTFiODJmYTdkOGM0NTBm"> </p>
<p class="cnNlMjJhNmRmNmE0ZDRhMTBiMjg0NjMyZTdmN2QyYWIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Another reason?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MTA5MzY5NTg4NjRhMmNhZDhhYWNmOGY4OWMxZGMx"> </p>
<p class="cnMyMzg1NDMyYTljMjQ3YzU4M2JlN2FhNTAxNTQ4NjE0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There is a small but very vocal group of Amazons that feel that we should remain isolated from Man’s World. Melanippe is one of them.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZTBjOGFiMDM0YjQ0YzZiYTFmMjViYmJkYWY0YTcz"> </p>
<p class="cnNlYzRjMDExMjhhYTRlMTNhODU2MDVmNjE5NTVmMWNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Isn’t that all the more reason another should teach Califa?” Diana frowned. “I wouldn’t want a small part of our Sisters to drive her off.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNmY5ZGU3NjVjMDQxMDY5ODdiMTRmYTFiYTAwYzEx"> </p>
<p class="cnNiMGM2YjM1YmZkZTRkNWY5ODY1YTkwNmYyM2E0YTIy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hippolyta chuckled, “I’d be rather surprised if an unwelcoming attitude was enough to drive the girl off. In fact I believe Melanippe may have done the opposite and will have to spend a considerable amount of effort avoiding or distracting her new student.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZjE1MmU0OWJkZDRlNDI4Yzk0NGZhNmYyYjc2M2Q3"> </p>
<p class="cnNmOTY3MWZlNzhlYzQxY2Q4ZDJmZTI4NmZjZDhhZjJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Diana thought about the reports Bruce had made about Califa’s determination to have him train her and her own few interactions with the young Saiyan. And she had to admit her mother probably had a point. Still…</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NjBhMGUzZWRmMDQwMjlhOGIzNzNjYzljZTViYWVi"> </p>
<p class="cnM5YTIwMmYxOWIxZDQ4YjM5Mzg3M2U1OTA2MjI3MTIx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That can’t have been your only reason.” She pressed, getting a nod in return.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MjJiZjE4ZDI1NTQ2ZDU5ZmYxOWNjMDNjNDc1MTQ4"> </p>
<p class="cnNlMGNhYTJkMjMzNjRhMTliZWM4MmQwNWQwZDVhZWUy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Indeed. I’m hoping that by interacting with the girl some of those vocal dissenters will realize something very important.” Hippolyta said seriously, causing Diana to look at her in alarm and confusion.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZjkzYjVlMzAyYjRlYzZhMjhhNjdkNGQxMzIyMjg3"> </p>
<p class="cnM3NzI0NTk5MWUwOTRkMDRiN2U1NTcwNzZiNzkxYzQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mother?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NDI5NWYwMGYyNjQxNmU4ZWFmYjFmOWYwNzFhNTM5"> </p>
<p class="cnM3Njg4OTkxZDI5ZjQ5MDY4YTEyMDBiMzg5ZDlhZWMx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know what I speak of, Daughter. You and your friends dealt with it not long ago.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MDRhMDcwMTQ1OTQzMDg4OGMxMGZkYmQ5ODZkMzkw"> </p>
<p class="cnMyOTYxZDc4YTZlNzQzMTg4ZTgyNThhNDNlOWMzYmE3"><span style="font-weight: 400">There were several things Diana had written or spoken to her mother of, but only one that stood out recently.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYmQzZTVkZGUxZDRhNDg4YmE4M2QwNDBlZGQ0Mzg5"> </p>
<p class="cnNiZWY1ODUwMDU0NjQ0MWU4NWQyNmRiYzRjMjM0YWJh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The invasion?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMzgyYmNmMDY3MjRiNmNhYWQ4ZTYyYjVkMGI5YzVj"> </p>
<p class="cnMzZDYwYjM2NWNlZDRmZDVhNThhMzc3M2JmZTFiOGFi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hippolyta nodded. “Yes, a horde of invaders from beyond the stars. One that infiltrated, suborned, sabotaged, and almost flat out conquered Man’s World in a week once they revealed themselves.” She paused and watched as Melanippe corrected some flaw in the Saiyan girl’s technique. “If it had not been for you and the others only the Gods know what might have happened. And we knew nothing about it until it was all over.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYmVhYjk0NDhmMTQ1NTY5YWExNDMwZTY2NzczMzRm"> </p>
<p class="cnM2ZmNkMDBkYzljZTQ4MDFhYmRlODA0ZTRkY2Y1YjA1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Imperium was crafty, it’s no surprise they managed to hide so well.” Diana offered but her mother waved it off.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNjJlMDgxZDA3YjQ3MzFiOTc4NDRmZDMzMjM4ZmNk"> </p>
<p class="cnMzNGMwZDU0Yzg1OTQ0MjVhMWNjZTVjNDA5MDA5NDY2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That wasn’t my point.” She denied. “The world is changing again, Diana. Califa is by her own admission young and weak for her species, yet she wields strength similar to a lesser demigod in the old days. If an army of her manages to find its way to Themyscira? We would fall.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYTNkNzlhOGM0NDRkNDhiOTAwMDY1OWVkMGI2MGJi"> </p>
<p class="cnNmNjQ4YjI2Yjk5NDRjNDU5NDg1NDE4OTgyNTUwODg4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I won’t let that happen.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZmE5NjRkYjc2NDRlZjJiMTc2NjU1ODFkODA2ODU4"> </p>
<p class="cnNiMjMxZmRlMjlkMTQ0M2RiM2UyNjg2MTU0OGZhMmU0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course not, if you knew about it.” Hippolyta agreed. “But that is the key of it, is it not? If we remain isolated, hidden from the rest of the world, who will we call for aid when the next invaders come for us? How will we know to prepare for war at the gates if the invaders land elsewhere?” She sighed. “No, we cannot remain isolated as we have been. I just hope the more stubborn of our Sisters realize that before it is too late.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMDE0ZGFlY2EyOTRiNDg4NWUyM2JmN2RlY2U5MzBi"> </p>
<p class="cnM4ZTkxNzkyMDdjMzQyMzZhNTZkM2QzOWZjZTQyZGNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Diana had nothing to say to that, since she also wanted more interaction between her home and Man’s World. In the end the mother-daughter pair simply watched the training below in silence, contemplating what the future could hold for them.</span></p>
