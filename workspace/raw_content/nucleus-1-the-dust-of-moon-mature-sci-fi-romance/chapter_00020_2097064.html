<p class="cnMxYmQyMzk4MmIzZTRmNmRhYjk1YWU0YzAxN2I0NDJk"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Room 1888, 88th Floor, Amber Moon Spire (琥月塔), ZenFusion Taipei branch, No. 7, Section 5, Xinyi District, Taipei, Taiwan, Imperium of Dragons territory</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZTdmMjZiMzk1NTQyOTViYTJmMDA2MGEyNzhiM2Ew"><img alt="Nucleus: The Dust of Moon" src="https://nucleusseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Pt4-Taipei-Imperial-Tower.png"/></p>
<p class="cnNjMmNiMTk5YjAwYTQyOGE5NDVlNzRkODZiMzQ0M2Y1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"<span style="font-size: 1.5em"><strong>G</strong></span>olden Serpents, assemble!" Dilinur Altai said as she sat in the crimson chair.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYTkwZmRhNTVjODQ4YjliOTdhMTE1YjMwNjBhMmI0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The conference room, lit by a dozen screens, came to life as three holograms appeared around the black table.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZmVjYTExZjhmNjQ2MTBhMjRlMTc2YWJhNWNmMmMw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Iron Roach appeared first, his form solid and menacing. His hair was slicked back against his scalp. Red sunglasses hid his eyes, and his black combat suit emphasized his large frame.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMDFlYzRmODE3YzQ3MjJhZDMzNTBkMWI4NzQ5ZmU5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Let's get this over with," he growled.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYzBjMDExYzdmZjRmOTI4Yzk4NzljYTZkYWEwMDcw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Impatient much, Iron Roach?" Kaori Ouyang appeared next. She wore traditional Japanese clothes, with her hair in a sleek bun held by ornate pins. Her amber eyes scanned the room, and her red lips curved into a smile. Dark golden earrings with red jewels hung from her ears.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiODIzYmZiYWVlYjQ0ZDRiODQ4ZjUxNzgzMDMyZjRl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Skarn has escaped, and so did one of our top engineers at ZenFusion Taipei," Dilinur said firmly. "As members of the Golden Serpent Circle, we must make haste to right the wrongs."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZTA2M2RiNDE2NDRkNWRhNzQ3ZjVlZjRjNjBmNjUx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Indeed," Shazmeen Varma was the last to appear, dressed in a black and crimson outfit that showed off her figure. Her long black hair fell down her back in waves. The patterns on her clothes showed her high status. "But let us not confuse haste for efficiency."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMTRmY2ExNjA3MzRmMWNiOGI3MWY5ZDIzNTY1ODNi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Though not all members of the Golden Serpent Circle were present, Dilinur thought these three would have to do for now.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTNhMDZmM2MyNjQwZjFhMDY5NzJhNDdjZjRmNGZh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I've read the reports," Roach said, his cybernetic eyes gleaming. "One of those eggheads defected and stole the Moondust Crystal's info, correct?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YjYwYWRlMWVlYTQwOGJhMDE3NjJkMDA1YTA0NzZi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Astonishing, Roach. You actually read what Dinu writes for once," Kaori remarked, the dragons on her robe seeming to move.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxM2Y4NzczYjhhNTQ4YjI4YjUzMTkwMTZjZDRkMTJl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Then there's the matter of the Amber Moon Spire," Shazmeen touched her chin. "In a single day, it has been infiltrated by two Alliance agents — right under our noses. An insult we can't ignore."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZGE5NGNmM2Q2NTQxZGM5NWUzNDRhN2JiMzg2ZjZm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"One of them is that Lorna Weiss, right?" Roach's jaw tightened. "It's high time we taught the little bitch a lesson."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMWJiNTY4MjZkMzRiNDJhZmI4ZjljNWE0MmY5Y2Ew"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I'm curious to finally meet this notorious Alliance agent you all seem so afraid of," Kaori added, narrowing her eyes. "I wonder if we should invite Joon-Seok for this task."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NmM1YjM3ZGQ0MzQ0Yzk4NmZjZmIxYjFkZDRlMDI1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Prince is currently on Mars. But I trust the two of you will be enough," Shazmeen nodded toward them. "Lorna Weiss is known for her arrogance, and tends to make mistakes when the opposition seems weak at first."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NjQ3YzlhNTZhODQwZGRhNGNkYjBiY2Y0ZGU2MDJh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Consider her gone, Shaz," Roach said with a nod. "Kaori and I have killed hundreds of Alliance bastards before."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNmE1N2Y5ODU3MDQwMThhMmUxZDg1Njk1NjU2NGFj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"About that. The Emperor just sent word. He wants Wu Zhi-Xin captured alive," Shazmeen tilted her head, her earrings chiming softly. "You can deal with Lorna Weiss however you want."</span></p><span class="cjhlN2EyMmExMWRmNzRlZmU4Y2M5MjRmMWYzYTg2Mjlh"><br/>Help support creative writers by finding and reading their stories on the original site.<br/></span>
<p class="cnMwMDhhODBhNjhhMDRlMmI5NmVmMDA0NzNkMWZiZDVl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Of course," Kaori chuckled. "Imperials always protect their own."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjODZiM2E0YjBlZjQwMzU5YmI4NTg5YmQxODdhNTk4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Meanwhile," Dilinur spoke up, "the Fenris Horde's Radi-Mon have grown bold with Skarn's escape. Our civilians need protection."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ODcwNzQ0MDFiMjRjM2E4YTUzZmVkZGRiMmI2YjU3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Isn't that what your Bloodtroopers are for?" Roach smirked, "I never cared much about peasants and weaklings."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYmM4MmFmMDNhMjQzOTI5ZjI2NjY5MTNhMTBlZTY5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Think of them as lowly if you want, Roach, but they are the lifeblood of our Imperium," Dilinur said, her black robe shifting. "An empire cannot survive without its people."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ODg0NTM0OWIyZDQ3ZjNiMmE1NWQxMGYwNjFlODZk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Commendable," said Kaori with a respectful nod, touching her red earrings.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YWQ5ODExZTI4OTRiY2NhM2ViMGZmMmZjMGU2M2Mz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Fine," Roach declared, his image starting to fade. "Just make sure your men stay out of my way. And Kaori's."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNDY0YjM2MmMwODRkMmQ5NmE3YTQ5MmI4MGYwMjUw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"As usual, I will monitor your progress and provide insights when needed," Shazmeen said, her hologram fading. "May victory be bathed in the blood of our enemies."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMWUzZDMxNTMxMzQ4NTliYzVjZjBlYjNkYTA2YWUy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Until next time," Kaori whispered, her form disappearing.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhY2I1NDU0OGFiNzQ5N2NhYzdmMDY5YmYxNjUxMmFl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The air crackled with the remains of the holograms when Zu-Shao Qin burst into the room, his unexpected arrival breaking protocol. He swept in like a storm, his robes flowing, his amber eyes gleaming.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDlkOTk1ZDc5ZTRhYmJiNzJhNTBiMjQ3ZGI1OTM2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Zu-Shao Qin radiated cold authority. His features were sharp and angular. His bald head added to his threatening appearance.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZWU0NzkzZTk5OTQyNzBhZGM4MWQ5YzY4NTQzYTk5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">He wore a luxurious robe with deep red and black patterns. The robe had golden embroidery along the edges and a fierce dragon symbol across his chest — a clear sign of his power.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZDc2NDgxOTA5ZTRkMmY5OGRlOTQwMGVmYzVkOGU3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Prefect Altai," Zu-Shao Qin said, his voice sharp and cold. "Your actions have reached my ears, and they sound like failure."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMWE2Yzg3ZGViMzQ2MmE4Njc2YzM4NmQ5NTZhYTE3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Governor Qin!" Dinu's throat tightened, each of Shao's words stinging her pride. She stood tall, though inside she trembled.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOWMwMjgxOGYwOTRhMTFhNTc3YTFmY2NhNzQ3ZTMy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yet," he continued, his amber eyes boring into her, "the Imperium is not without mercy."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMWQ4MWQzMzgxYjQ4ZDVhMjM0OWJhN2FlMWY2YTAy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dinu's heart raced as she fought to stay composed. She had to obey Shao – he was her superior, the one with all the power over her. Her superior, protector and oppressor. Still, she straightened her back and met his gaze firmly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZjAyM2YyNmM1YTQ4OWZhN2Q3MDkxZGJiZjQ3NzIw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"My lord, I have already asked for help from all Golden Serpent members on Earth. You won't be disappointed," she said confidently, hoping to please him.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2M2E1NjE4ZjA2OTQ5M2I5ZjMxMDUxODk5YTUwMzEx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I heard the meeting. Change your plans," Shao ordered, holding up a finger. "You and your Bloodtroopers will go after Subject S — that Radi-Mon named Skarn. You will capture him until my Conjurers arrive to take him back into custody."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZDkyNThlMThhMjRjZTE5ODYyNzZhYTM0MDk3MjRi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The room hummed with tension. Dilinur touched the hairpin holding her hair.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMzFlZjg4ZjllMDRlMjRhZDJjZmYzNzY0Y2JiNjll"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Governor Qin," she said quietly. "The task is clear, but I must ask — the civilians of Taiwan need our protection."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZWU3ZTg3NzlmODRmNmE4N2FjY2MyYjY1OTcxNmRk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Your empathy isn't a virtue here, Dinu," Shao waved dismissively. "We've put too many resources into Skarn's revival and cybernetic enhancements to let him roam free. One doesn't worry about blood spilled when removing a tumor."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZDY0ZDJjOTZlODQ3MzU4ZTk4NTUxMDZmMWQ1ODFk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Even when the blood is that of our people, my lord?" Dilinur challenged, her gaze steady despite her inner turmoil.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OWQ2MDhiYjM5YTQxNTZiZjM4M2QzZGRkNzZkNjQ0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Collateral," he spat. "Remember your place, and remember what happens to those who let feelings cloud their judgment."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MzljNzY2NDhkMjRlOWZiNTFmNGMzNzc3Mzc1NjY2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The order hung in the air like a weight she had to carry or be crushed by. She nodded stiffly, like a puppet on strings.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NjMwMTU4OGMzYTQzMjY4ODUyMmVkZTI5YWM4ZDBh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Understood, Governor Qin," she replied quietly, barely hiding the storm inside her.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0M2UxYTkyMTM3YjQ5MDE5YTQzOGMwODhiMzZjNGVj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Shao's lips twitched into something like a smile, a predator showing its teeth. He turned, his robe swirling around him like a red tide. "Once you're done, report to me at the Governor's Palace."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYTdmZmJhNWVhZTQ2N2Q4YTRjZmJlNzhiYTEzZTVi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The silence that followed was cold and empty. Dilinur stared at Shao's retreating form, the dragon on his robe reminding her of his power.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNzdlMWFkYWJkYTRjNDJhZmFlMzBjMzIyZGUzZWUy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She turned away, her shadow stretching across the floor as she stepped into the corridor. Six Bloodtroopers and two Conjurers waited for her orders, ready for war.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYTZhZTNhMjYyNTRjZDZhMGFhZWYyYjVmZTY3NmYy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Protect the innocents," she whispered to herself. "Protect them, even as you walk with devils."</span></p>
