<p class="cnM5YmEzZjZlZGQ3MDQ5Y2Q5NmE2NDkxOWRjNjhiMGY0"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">The sound of chains.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZWZkMzg4ZTJhMTQ4NjQ5ZjFkNGIxY2U1NjM2NmE3"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Hidden in the dark miasma, an angel and a demoness watched and rejoiced. Their putrid and mechanical bodies closed with each other, their hands intertwined and locked up with the very same chains that they were using to drag Tristessa’s soul through time itself.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMGIyMmEzNWQxZTQ2NGFiYTFmMzc0YTFiMzhkOTY4"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“<span style="color: rgba(224, 62, 45, 1)">■ ■ ■ ■… ■ ■ ■</span>,”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YjI3MTc1NzJkNDQ2MTQ5YjlhMTAwZTI3ODhiYzk4"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">The divine and impossible-to-understand voice of Endrel shook the astral plane in its entirety. A voice that was more than enough to make her consort, Margules, to move her to bloody tears. She laid her head against her chest, coupling the gears that protruded from her temple with those that formed part of the black heart of the Angel of Rebirth.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNzQ3MGIzZTg3YjQ2ZjJiOWY2ZDUyZmQyYjk2YjFl"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">But no even for a second, those two lovers stopped pulling her chained soul, dragging her back to Life, sailing through the rivers of infinity.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZmRlMzk5NjU2YzRlZDA4YzA2ZWUyNDY0NGViOTgz"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">The darkness vanished and Tristessa's eyes saw the light again, acquiring specificity and finally becoming that stuffed Varg behind one of the display cases in the atrium of the former House of the Royal Hunters.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYTgxMmJhZWE3YTRkNmI5NGYzMmViODIyMTE4YzUz"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“<em>Huh?! A Varg…?!</em>” she thought, by reflex, and took a step back before realizing that the beast was dead. “<em>What just…? I was…?</em>”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhODA5NjBlMDYwMDQ1YTI5NzQxNmU1YWNmOTE3Y2U4"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Just by rummaging a little bit into the surface of her mind, Tristessa’s bloodshot eyes widened upon the rush of fresh memories.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNzFmY2QyMThjZDRlZjliMTgxYzY0YmQ1MDk4Mjc3"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">She had returned, once again, to that specific place and time in the world. Without resurrecting from within a lone giant she-wolf in the Sea of Trees. The sands of time flowing in reverse, violating the laws of physics, dragging the Universe and entropy back, with no apparent consequence other than the violent pulsations she felt in the mark on her chest.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOTBmMzU5MzA1MTRhNzdiODBhMGJjOTQ2ZGQzYjli"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Her Baptism in Ruins, etched into her skin and beyond, taking up more surface to the point of reaching her shoulders and covering her breasts, spreading dangerously.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NWJhODdkNzg1NDRmNWY4OWQwMzIyZTg0YTczYjVm"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Ah…Uhh…” Tristessa opened her mouth, broken words never leaving her throat, her breathing ragged. “<em>Eccch</em>…<em>kaff</em>…</span></p>
<p class="cnMwY2ZhMmM5ZjNkYjQxODdhMjJkY2U3NTU3OGI3OGMx"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Of course, her body still wasn't comprehending that her head was attached to her neck once again, and therefore, that she was alive. All her vital functions returned in the blink of an eye, in a shock of electricity that ran through her entire body alongside rivers of pain and made her hands drop the tea tray she was holding.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MTFkZTg3Y2I5NDRlM2VhZTIxZGE1OWEzNmQ3ZWE4"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">The sound of breaking porcelain filled the atrium, shards scattering everywhere, shards scattering everywhere. But Tristessa cared little, didn't even register the disaster: she placed a trembling hand on her neck, feeling that everything was connected, intact, trying to convince her body that breathing was possible without interpreting her past-beheading like soul-rending pain.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMjFlNzgwZGEyZDQ5ZTc5MjdiY2M1MTg1OWEzNjZi"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">In that conflict between timelines, her mind was connecting the present with the future-past that no longer existed, gathering information that, by its simple paradoxical nature, she shouldn't possess.</span></p><span class="cjZmYTljMzYxYzU2YzQ1NmNhNDY4OTliODQ3MjZkMjM5"><br/>This book's true home is on another platform. Check it out there for the real experience.<br/></span>
<p class="cnMxNTk2NDlkNTc0NTQyNzA4NWE4MjNhZWEyMWRmNjQ2"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">And yet, she remembered everything. The days lost drowning in her own misery, Gaal's death, Severus's appearance, and the attack on the house…</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ODdkNDJkYWJkMTQ3YjM5OTg1ODU1MzIwZjIwZjYz"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">The Coven. That group of vile women whose only goal was to cause agony and disaster.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYjhhNzI5NzgyZjQ2ZDJiODA0MmY0M2ZhYWU4ZGE0"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Everything she heard about them, about what the threat they represent, about what they’re capable of… Now she knew that the stories were true. Those monsters, worse than vargs roaming the Sea of Trees, going around with absolute freedom to plan, gather intelligence and attack without warning.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDEwZmFkYzRlYTQxYmU5MDdkNjZmMTdiZjYxMDky"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">And with terrifying effectiveness. Without caring at all about being struck by thunder, getting shot at and slashed to pieces. Even dying was superfluous for them.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NDA0OWFlZGUyNTQxZjA5Y2I4MGE1MTc0NDczNmE0"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“<em>Those fucking bitches…</em>”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNDg1NzdjNGE1NjRhNDBiMzU4MmZiY2QzZmRhZmU5"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Tristessa experienced anger like never before. Insane hatred, burning every cell in her body. Thinking of those lunatics, their unhinged laughter as they set fire to the house, as they fought Severus, as they sang and desecrated the bodies of…</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMWZiNTU2NTBlNTQ4NzY5ZTVmODIzMDUzZjUxYWNh"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“M-Miss? Are you all right?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YzQ3YjAyZjYxZTRhMTdiNzMxNzE1YzQ1NDYyNzI4"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">The memory of the butchered and defiled body of that chestnut-haired boy was very much alive in Tristessa’s mind. Now Lucahn was there, complete, standing behind the field of porcelain splinters, holding his book to his chest and staring at her with wide, scared eyes. Without any memory of her, without any knowledge about her forbidden Divinity, and without knowing about the strangely conflictive name of her mother.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MGQ2MmUzZDk4ZDRhMWM4NGNlM2E2YTVjNjZmZTZk"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Damn girl, that tea set was the only salvageable thing in this Gods-forsaken house. Do you have any idea how long we’ll be without a cup of good tea until the blood elf comes and we beg him to bring us a new set?! Months, at best!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYTkxYmYyYjRiZTRjMGM5NmVkOWI0MjI3NWU5YmZm"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Then there was the fresh memory of the dissected body of Tiara watching them from the kitchen. Now she was also very alive, and very visibly angry at the mess she have made. With no memory at all of all their discussions, about how much they hated each other.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYmI4MzUxY2MwZjRiNmRiYjkzYTRmODMxNDZmYTg3"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">And her belly, now swollen and full of life, hidden behind her dress and apron… While inside Tristessa’s mind, within the darkest of corners, the unholy memory of that little life was…was…</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NDA0OGU5YTAwYjQzOGI5ZWY2YmRjOWI4MjM4OTky"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“<em>Blech!</em>” Tristessa brought both hands to her stomach but couldn't stop herself from expelling the breakfast, soiling the display case and her shirt. The chills caused by those memories and her burning insides forced her to hug herself.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDRiYzI3NTFkZjQ5YjE5NTA5YzVkZGI4ZGM1OTNl"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Are you serious?! Damn you, I'll make you clean this whole mess up with your tongue!"</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NjhiODcxYjAzNjQ5Y2I5ODM4NjJlYmUyNTZlNTAw"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Tristessa wasn't listening, she didn't even see Tiara approaching out of the corner of her eye: her consciousness was focused exclusively on the atrocities she had witnessed, where her fury threatened to burn everything, just like the fire that had engulfed the Mercer-Archeos House...</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOWRhM2VlNGVlNjQ3M2JiNjQ4Y2RmMTliNWIwNmY3"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">But she felt cold. An ice storm emanating from the darkest corner of her dark soul. The implications of the future made her reason, a dreadful horror of what was going to happen, freezing her and her burning emotions.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYzZiNjAzYTE3YjQ0ZGY4YmI5YjNlMGYyMzBmMmQ2"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">A sense of<span style="color: rgba(224, 62, 45, 1)"> <strong>[Impending Doom]</strong></span>.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNThmMzdmMGMxNDRjM2JiMjljNjM5NTVmNWEwM2Y4"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“What do you have to say, stupid girl? Huh?!” Tiara questioned her, having passed over the sea of ​​porcelain and looking down on her as if she was a disgusting insect that deserved to be crushed. “Speak!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZDRmMjQ0YzFhYTQ1MGI5ODQ2YTY2ZTIxYWNkNTA4"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“…coming.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwODU5MjcyZjdhZTQxNzZhN2FkNDEzZDk4MDdhMWJi"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“What?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNGJmMzMzZTI4MjRiZDU5YTNmNGY5Y2Y0ODAyNThk"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Tristessa turned her head to look back at the irate woman, who then expressed confusion at seeing indescribable terror reflected on her face.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkN2ZmZGVjNjU3MTRhMzNhMGI4YjJkODY0YzU1OWU4"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“They… They’re coming…”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDMyYmQ1NWNkODRjN2E4NTBjNzFmMjcwYjg3OTll"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Finding the ability to speak aloud, Tristessa let out everything she felt, everything that tormented her, with the horrifying memories still present, screaming at the top of her lungs and sobbing:</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMmNjMjQ1YzJmMDRkZjE5Y2QxMzRkMzVkNDRkNWMx"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“THE COVEN! THEY WILL COME HERE AND KILL US ALL!”</span></p>
