Fighters and blastboats screamed overhead, trading fire back and forth—a result of only a <em>near miss</em><span style="font-style: normal"> instead of a direct hit on one of the enemy’s airfields. The air was filled with the </span><span style="font-style: normal">scents</span><span style="font-style: normal"> of </span><span style="font-style: normal">ozone,</span><span style="font-style: normal"> burning metal, chemicals, plastic, rubber, and the unmistakable s</span><span style="font-style: normal">tench</span><span style="font-style: normal"> of burning meat </span><span style="font-style: normal">drifting up from the flaming ruin of the base we had made camp beside</span><span style="font-style: normal">. It seemed that it didn’t matter whether they were human, Abyssan, or something else—the stink of fire reducing protein to carbon was universal. </span></p>

Clinical. “All but three of the enemy’s ships in orbit destroyed. Their largest base reduced to slag. Their ground forces shattered. The last of their fighters have rallied for a last ditch sortie,” overhead, the whine of engines blew past, more approaching quickly. “Right into our anti-air emplacements—”</p>

<p class="cnM3MTc3MWVlZGVkODQ0MDRhMDE5MDQ2ZWNlODk5MWUx" style="margin-bottom: 0">Four AA batteries opened up, filling the night sky with the red flash of laser cannon fire, the thump of them firing in several long bursts too loud to talk over without yelling. An explosion briefly lit up the sky, the sound reverberating in my chest and rattling the holocom on the table. The high-pitched wails of punctured starship thrusters spiraling out of control echoed from the distance, like the dying screams of banshees. A heartbeat later, more explosions rumbled through the valley, strong enough to knock the holocom from the table. Jango reached out and caught it before it could fall to the ground.</p>

Once more, the camp became a flurry of movement and noise as people began disassembling the AA emplacements to stow and move camp. I smiled.</p>

The air was a muggy, almost swamp-like soup and I was eager to finish this up and get the <em>Rusted Silver</em><span style="font-style: normal"> moved to our new camp, so I could enjoy the benefits of a climate controlled cabin and sonic shower to wash off the lingering stickiness from the humidity.

Beside them, Jaster did a subtle two-fingered tap to his gauntlet—what I had come to learn was a Mandalorian gesture for a moment of silent battlefield calculation. Meanwhile, Obi stood straight, arms folded under her chest, radiating that particular brand of calm disapproval that all Jedi seemed to master.</p>

We’ll do our best to put it to use on our end. In the meantime, Jango,” the man beside me perked up, “orders still stand. Take the ground defense stations and knock out those last few ships, then start mopping up.”</p>

The information you’ve provided should allow us to find the rebels more easily and start working together,” Qui-Gon sent me a smile.The meeting ended soon after, leaving myself, Jango, and Master Dyas sitting around the camp table.

Three per should punch through their shields and destroy the ships themselves easily enough. However, we should try to coordinate things so they all fire at the same time. That way, none of them can leave and call for reinforcements. We should also, obviously, take the facilities at the same time so that they don’t realize something is wrong and try to sabotage them.”</span></p>

<p class="cnM5NWVhMmU2ZGVlYTRmMDVhMjE4MzAxZGY3ZDdlNWFj" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<span style="font-style: normal">Same.” My only worry was transport. Reaching into the incomplete computation orb, I checked its storage and compared it against the requirements for a flight formula under the effects of atmosphere and gravity—since space didn’t really count, given that it was </span><em>much</em><span style="font-style: normal"> cheaper. I had enough juice for a short flight, perhaps a </span><em>very short</em><span style="font-style: normal"> engagement, but not more than three or so minutes at full combat output. “</span><span style="font-style: normal">I’ll need transport.”</span></p>

<p class="cnMyNTYxMjdmZWNiNzRkOWRhNmQwMjEzYWFiODBmNTZk" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<span style="font-style: normal">Hm?” I asked as he stood up and motioned for me to follow. I did, Master Dyas following along with a smile, radiating amusement. </span><span style="font-style: normal">Jango led us to his ship and inside, to the equipment storage locker. Opening it up, he began digging around inside.</span></p>

Mandalorian armor isn’t just the bare metal.” Pausing, he pulled back and tapped his arm, and the wrist mounted weapon there. “A lot of pieces have integrated weapons and other systems. Rockets, missiles, flamethrowers, blasters, sensors in the helmets, and so on. But there are also,” he pulled out a black piece of equipment the size of a backpack—one I recognized instantly as a </span><span style="font-style: normal">JT-12 model </span><span style="font-style: normal">jetpack. “</span><span style="font-style: normal">Jetpacks. This one belonged to Tor.”</span></p>

<p class="cnM1YmJhZTlmM2I0MjRjZTNiYmZkMGEzMWNmNWFjYTg2" style="margin-bottom: 0">My mouth went a bit dry and I reached out and touched it. Jango continued, “Range on them isn’t great. A fully loaded trooper can fly about twelve miles continuously. Altitude ceiling is pretty much as long as it has fuel and oxygen, but you’ve got to make allowances for deceleration and landing. But for you, given your size, even fully kitted out…”</p>
<p class="cnNlNjY0MDVmNmNmZjQ1ZjQ5N2IyNDdjNmRhNzBmNGNm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM5MjY0NTg5ZTA5ZTRlZTFiMzE1NDA0YjJkYjAyMTE3" style="margin-bottom: 2em">“Three times that easily,” I nodded. “Yes, I’ve done some research to see how feasible they were for me.”I also knew that I could connect it to my vac suit’s helmet to use the HUD there and it came with a few different ways of controlling it, including a handheld controller that would pitch the nozzles as needed or an eye tracking system that integrated into most smart helmets. One of the biggest issues I’d seen with them was that manufacturers tried to do too much with them. A single missile launcher, grappling hooks, and other useless bloat. If they removed all of that and converted the wasted space into a fuel tank, they could get four to five times the range. The point of a jetpack was <em>mobility</em><span style="font-style: normal">, after all—not a convenient place to mount an extra missile. And if you wanted to do that, </span><em>you could add a hard point!</em></p>
<p class="cnM3OTk0N2I4NjY5MTRmNjZiNTk3NTgwYzQ5ZWY2YTli" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNkYTNkZjQzNTA2MjQyYTk4OTNlZGZiY2VjNjgwMzFi" style="margin-bottom: 0">“If I had a day, I’d make the modifications I want and increase the range. Since I don’t…”</p>

<p class="cnNiYThiMGY3ZmQ1YjRiNDc5ZDcxYzEwY2U3NTE1YWYx" style="margin-bottom: 0">“We’ll be dropping everyone off close to their targets and you’ll move in on foot, using the jetpack to scale anything in your way, then evac once they fire and get to a safe distance, just in case one of those ships doesn’t go down and shoots back,” Jango explained.</p>
<p class="cnM4YzFmZmMyZDM1ZTRjNjQ5ZGJlZGFmZDU1OWViOGI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMzNjMxNDlkNTUyYzRmMjM5ODg0NzQxYjBmNWVjOTZl" style="margin-bottom: 0">I nodded. Picking up the jetpack, I shouldered it and strapped it into place. It was just a bit over sixty-five pounds. I’d carried heavier rucks, but at the moment, it was basically ninety percent of my body weight, given that I weighed about seventy pounds—all of it muscle, of course. I was still growing, but my weight was a little above average for my height and sex—mostly thanks to training and packing on muscle. Still, it would slow me down come time to fight, so I’d need to hit the quick release on the straps to get out of it for melee combat.</p>

<p class="cnM3MWMwYTNkYjllYzQ1NTM4MTZmZjRmYzc5YWQ4YzAx" style="margin-bottom: 0">Jango checked the time then hummed. “We’ll set out in half an hour.”</p>

<p class="cnMzMjRlNGZiMDFkMzQ1ODA5ZjRmNDU0MzY2MzcwNTE2" style="margin-bottom: 0">“I’ll be ready,” I agreed and turned away, heading to my ship. Dropping off the jetpack, I pulled off my robe and pulled on the vac suit, since the power source for the helmet was integrated into it and I couldn’t just use the helmet by itself. Then, I pulled my robes and other gear back on. Grabbing the jetpack, I strapped it on and pulled my helmet on, linking up the systems and making sure everything was working.</p>
<p class="cnNhYjEyZmFhMDVjODQ2YWViYzhhM2ZjYTQyZjBkYjU0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNmOGJhZGU0ZjkzZjQ5OGE5Y2U3MzQzM2I3MmMwOWY4" style="margin-bottom: 0">Once I was sure it was good, I made some final preparations—grabbing a trio of small grenades to put on my belt and a breaching charge since that would generally be faster than trying to cut my way in. Then, I made my way outside and took the jetpack off, then had a seat and waited. Someone came by and handed me an ear bead. I synced it with my holocom and linked that up to the network so I’d have access to comms.</p>

<p class="cnNlYTliM2I1MjRkNjQ3ZjdhM2I2MDllMzgxZDM5MWJj" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Radio check,” someone on the line said, and a stream of verifications came in. I waited for an opening before confirming, then verified it was transmitting.</p>

<p class="cnMxNjg1NzM0YmNkODRhZmJiNmU2NzljMDIwNzM2ZmMz" style="margin-bottom: 0">Finally, Jango approached and waved everyone going over. “Alright, people, listen up. Master Dyas,” he nodded to the Jedi in question, “will by going in by speeder bike. For the rest of us, it’s a standard high altitude insertion. We’ll go up, set our targets, and you’ll jump as we come to them. Land close, then make your way there on foot. Check in when you’re in position, then wait for my signal. The ground stations we’re taking have a maximum crew of five on site. Once you’ve eliminated them, report in and we’ll move on to phase two. We’ll bring the guns online, sync them up, and take out the ships in orbit. As soon as they fire, bug out and radio for retrieval when you’re at least five miles from the site. Any questions? Comments?”</p>

<p class="cnM4Y2VhMmY3YzBjNzQzODhiZTQyZThlNDQ4MGY5MWYz" style="margin-bottom: 0">I thought about reminding them that we were probably up against Abyssins and so they’d need to finish the job after the initial shots put them down, but dismissed the idea. They were all consummate professionals. It would be like the brand new private reminding his CO to make sure he had a round chambered. Unneeded and a bit insulting. So I kept my mouth shut and waited.</p>
<p class="cnM5ODc0NmU4MGMxNTRiYTk5MTlhOTQ3NzUxZWQzMjQ5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM0NTY0YzUxNjc5ZDQ2ZTE4ZTg2MmUxODkzMTIxODFi" style="margin-bottom: 0">When no one spoke up, Jango nodded. “Load up.”</p>

<p class="cnM5OTY4NmFkMzY4NjQ0OTdiY2I5NmZlYWQzMGVhZWQ1" style="margin-bottom: 0">I followed the others into a transport and took a seat between Jango and a female Mando I didn’t know the name of. Unfolding my helmet, I put it on and brought up the HUD, then settled in for the flight as the transport lifted off and began to climb. A few minutes into the flight, my HUD flashed and a map of the region popped up, designating nine defense stations as our targets. One in particular changed to red and my name popped up over it. It was on the top of a mountain that had been leveled off, in a heavily wooded area. A countdown timer started and several of the Mandos, including Jango, stood. He thumped my shoulder and I followed as the group made their way back to the hatch at the back of the transport.</p><span class="cmRlYmEzMDlmZjRmMzQwNjk5ZjVjYTNkMTc0Njg2OGQ1"><br/>This novel is published on a different platform.

I followed and blinked as my HUD updated and outlined a flight path to my target. With smooth, well practiced motions, I angled myself towards my target and let myself fall—just enjoying freefall for a few moments.</p>

<p class="cnNkZGE5MDc1ODcxZTQ1NWJhNGRiYTdmZDQyMGZiNGJi" style="margin-bottom: 0">“I’m fine,” I confirmed, then engaged the jetpack. It wasn’t quite like flying under my own power, but it was fun. I quickly worked out the finer details of jetpack flight and settled in to powered flight down. When I was only a mile out from the target, I picked a nice spot a little further down the mountain from the emplacement and shifted course down towards it. The trail up was forested and the trees should provide good cover for me coming in from ground level.</p>

I touched down with a thump and stumbled a few paces, but I had to admit that it was pretty good for a first flight and landing. Much better than I’d done on my first landing with a flight formula. But then, there was a reason we had done water landings initially with that—to keep new aerial mages from splattering themselves on the ground.</p>

See what she has compared to the Mandos and the Republic Army. Maybe wherever she came from had something different enough to surprise the enemy.</em></p>

<p class="cnM4MzgxMWZiOTk4OTRiMzRhMGFjMTY0ODk5YjI2MTMz" style="margin-bottom: 0">A familiar presence in the Force drew his attention and, at the same time, he saw Tanya look up in the direction of it. The Mandos went alert a moment later at the sound of engines, but Sifo called out, “It’s a friend. Another Jedi Master.”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZDI3ODRjYjBiMjRhZTFiMGM0M2QyODJjZGY0ZjUy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNhMmNiMjUyNzFhNjQzZDBiODhkNDQxOTU5YzNjMDlj" style="margin-bottom: 0">That caused them to look at Jango, who nodded and called, “As you were.”</p>
<p class="cnNjMTk0YzM2OWM5ZjQ5MjNiYzY5ZWFmYzk4MDdhYzY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNmZjQ0MmIwNzVkMDQ5ZTliYTE5ZjJjNjZlMzk0ODJk" style="margin-bottom: 0">The troops went back to what they had been doing as the ship came in over wooded area where they were camping. After a few moments, it found a spot to land and settled down. Not long after that, he felt that Force presence moving closer, through the forest. Soon enough, she walked into the light of one of the fires and the square gem on her forehead caught the light. Sifo-Dyas smiled, waving towards the short, purple skinned, white haired woman.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZGMyYzhlY2M5MDQ3OGNhNGVmMDVkNDExNzNhYWFj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM0YTVkMDJmMjMzMDQzODI5MGExMGM1MDE4OWU4NGEw" style="margin-bottom: 0">He stood as she approached and the older woman smiled, pulling him into a hug. “Master Lene, it’s good to see you.”</p>
<p class="cnMxZGRlMjI1NTBhNDRhMzc5MGEyZDAwOTVhMWQ5NmNi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM4MmY3OWFhMzkyNTQ0NDZiZWVlZWJiY2I3ZmNkYjFm" style="margin-bottom: 0">“You as well, Sifo,” she nodded, giving him a squeeze and letting go, before pinching him in the side, earning a hiss from the man. “And it’s just Lene to you, boy. I stopped being your Master long ago, and you’re a Master yourself now.”</p>
<p class="cnNiZmE4OWU3ZTk5YzQ3YmQ4MzVhYWI2NTJlMGE3Yzk1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNkN2NmZTgzODQ3MTQzYzdhMmRjNmQ0MWIwMTg0ODky" style="margin-bottom: 0">“You’ll always be Master to me,” Sifo chuckled, before gesturing at the camp chairs. “Please, sit. There’s food, if you’re hungry.”</p>
<p class="cnM3YjM1ZmMzNjc1MDQ0YjlhNGJmYjQ0MmNhNmViYTNj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM3YzZkYzYzYjYyODQxZmNiYWIyNzIxYTEyNGM0NTdl" style="margin-bottom: 0">“I could do with some tea if you have it,” she murmured, and Sifo nodded, grabbing a kettle, filling it with water, and putting it on the fire to heat.</p>
<p class="cnMxNWYyNTNhZDg0YjQ2ODM4YjdlZTU3ZDA5YjM2ZTVh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNhYzZkZmE1NGZkZDQwOWM4ZDk2YmVjOTM5MWQ3NDVi" style="margin-bottom: 0">“So Master, what brings you to Serenno?” Quieter, he said, “We both know the story about Sith artifacts is bunk.”</p>
<p class="cnM5NGJkMDVjYzZiMzRkOWE4OTIxYjYzZDBmY2U0OTA3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNkMjI4NzM3OWYxMDRlNzRiMDdkNDViOGY0MjNhMmEx" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Mm, true,” Lene murmured. Looking away, her brown eyes turned towards where Tanya had left Jango to go practice for the night, one of her white-silver sabers swinging through a Makashi kata. “Perhaps I wanted to see this student you’ve taken on.”</p>
<p class="cnNiMjVkZWJkM2RhYjQ0YzRiMTMzYjA1ZDU5NWExODg0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM2YTU4Zjg4YWRmNjQ5ZWI5ZDUxMmJkNDcxNmY5ZTEz" style="margin-bottom: 0">Sifo shook his head, chuckling. “She’s not my student, Master. If anything, she’s Dooku’s padawan in all but name.”</p>
<p class="cnNhYWYyMjUyNTQwODQ3MjdhMGNjNmYwOTJkY2QxZDBh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM1ZTkzZDIxZjNhMjQ2YTliMTBkNjY3MWI1OGU5MWVi" style="margin-bottom: 0">The older woman nodded. “Yes, I see that in her.” Not looking away from Tanya’s form, she said, “No, I came because I feel we are at a moment of great importance. One of Mace’s shatterpoints. I had a vision. Of a great and shining future—of hope and new beginnings. But also, dark and terrible—so much death and bloodshed. I believe we are due for troubling times and this is where the decision will ultimately be made that will set us down that path.”</p>
<p class="cnNkYzJjYjFlMGZmMDRmNDJiZDk2NjA0ZDJhMTg0ZmQx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMwNzM5Y2Y0OTgxMDRlMDM4NDMwZjEyYWRlN2FiYTZl" style="margin-bottom: 0">“I see,” Sifo sighed. “Yes, I’ve had similar visions. We’ve come to believe strongly, based upon the evidence and clues we’ve seen, that the Sith have returned. But why Serenno?”</p>
<p class="cnM5Zjg4NGVjMTg5NzQ4MTg5ZDFhMGE5YTgyOTIxYmY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNiMGY2YjBmMGY2MzRjZWY4OThhZGI5MzljMTEwYzU3" style="margin-bottom: 0">“I’m not certain,” Lene admitted. “But it is the Sith’s nature to corrupt everything they touch. And look who is here. Four Jedi Masters and two padawans. She is already not completely of the light. That would make a tempting target for a Sith. But I believe young Tanya is not the focus, merely someone with the potential to be swept up in something greater than all of us. It is difficult to tell with her. Her future is shrouded.”</p>
<p class="cnMyMGY0NzhmMWQyMzQ2MjU4ZGU0ODBmN2ViODYwOThk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNlOWEyNjZhYzJhZTRiMzY4YTMwZDE3N2Q1MGM4NmYx" style="margin-bottom: 0">“So I’ve seen,” Sifo murmured. “The visions I’ve seen are mixed. I’ve seen visions of her as a Jedi and fighting against droids, but I’ve also seen…”</p>
<p class="cnMwMzQ0MDI4M2MyODQ5YTg4YjFiMjlkMTZjOWI1MWFl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM1Y2Q2ZTNlNDBjNzRlNDViODgxMjU1ZmFlOWNjYzMz" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Dressed all in black, with a red lightsaber?” Lene asked, and Sifo nodded. “So have I. But I didn’t get the feeling of <em>malice</em> I’ve gotten from past visions of Sith.”</p>
<p class="cnM2OThlMjM0NmY4MDQ2ZTVhYTE0NDA4OTY1Yjg2MmFk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM0NGQ3NjZmZGY0ZTRlNTk4NjExYmY2NTEzOWFkYmEx" style="margin-bottom: 0">Sighing, Sifo pulled the kettle from the fire and poured two cups of tea, handing one to Lene. “So this shatterpoint. It’s Dooku, isn’t it. This is his home, after all. He has family here.”</p>
<p class="cnM1NWVlYTkxNmNjMTRkMzM5YTE2MGExNDI5ZmNkZDdm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NjA1YjkzYWNkZDQ5N2E5ZWFjYzdiNWFmYzBkMjQ0" style="margin-bottom: 0">“I cannot say for certain, but that is my suspicion, for those reasons. Likewise, I cannot tell what the correct course of action is, to avert that future.”</p>

<p class="cnNiNTM3ZGNjYWYyYzQ3YTlhYjdjMDEyMmFkMWIxMDVm" style="margin-bottom: 0">Sifo considered for a few moments, sipping his tea. Finally, he asked, “Are we sure it’s a future that <em>should</em><span style="font-style: normal"> be averted? Most would say a wildfire is bad, but it clears away the old and the dead and makes way for new growth. Some species only reproduce in the presence or aftermath of one.”</span></p>

<p class="cnMxYzdjMDE3ZTg3MDQ5OWVhODFjOTgzMDlmZGE5MDE0" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">Lene sighed, before chuckling quietly. “That is the case, yes. However… it’s hard to approve of the fire when you’re the one being consumed by it.”</p>

He was willing to review footage and reports of the Mandos’ performance instead of viewing things in person, if it would help his old master.</span></p>

Just,” she paused, considering. Sifo knew it as the look she sometimes got when deciding whether or not to share something from one of her own visions. Finally, she said, “Don’t limit yourself too much. </span><span style="font-style: normal">Mandalorians are not Jedi. They don’t have our code. A team is more than just its leader.”</span></p>
