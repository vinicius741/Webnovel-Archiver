<p class="cnM4ZjUwNDFhMGFhNjQ4ZDhhODc3NGY0NDRhMmVjNzFk" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Is something the matter?” Obi asked as she grabbed her bag and stepped off the <em>Rusted Silver</em><span style="font-style: normal"> behind me.</span></p>

<p class="cnMyNGNmNGRlODdhYTQ1MTU5YjhkMmZjNDczYjAwYzM2" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">Then, there was the other thing. I could feel the temple in the Force from here and I didn’t like what I felt. With more time away and more experience, I’d grown to dislike coming back.</p>

<p class="cnNhMDE1MWNlZDU2OTRhNDNiODQ0YmNlYTAxNzdiZDA2" style="margin-bottom: 0">We moved through the spaceport concourse and joined Masters Dooku, Qui-Gon, and Kostana in line waiting for a speeder to take us to the temple. Seeing that they weren’t in the middle of a conversation I would interrupt and it looked like we might be here a while given the time of day and how large the line was, I decided to ask.</p>

<p class="cnNjN2VhNDVjZTFhNTQwMWJiZDliYTJiYzk2ZTg2N2E2" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Master Dooku, do you have a moment?” I asked, just to be sure.</p>

<p class="cnMyNmZkMGVmNWY4MDRiN2NhMDBiMTg3YmY2ZjU3YWRi" style="margin-bottom: 0">The older man turned a smile on me, before taking an obvious look around. “It seems we have some time, but I’ll always make time for a student.”</p>

<p class="cnNkNmFkZTg0ZTI5MDQyYmFiYWYzNDVlZmE3NDYwZTM3" style="margin-bottom: 0">Nodding, I looked towards the temple and back. “How do you deal with it?”</p>

<p class="cnNkY2Q3N2EzOTVkZTRkZWFiMWU3ZTMxN2VlZThkNzYz" style="margin-bottom: 0">That drew Master Qui-Gon’s and Master Kostana’s curious gazes, even as I felt Obi’s own attention on me. Master Dooku chuckled quietly. “I’m afraid you’ll need to be a bit more specific.”</p>
<p class="cnMwYmIyMjZmNjgzNjRjZGZhY2Y1NmMyM2JmOGQ4YzNm" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM1NjkzODVjYmMyYTQ0Nzk4ZDhkMTQzMmY4ZTY0ZTcx" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Perhaps it is a delicate matter, Master,” Qui-Gon proposed, his tone teasing. “After all, certain aspects of being within the temple can be rather… <em>trying</em><span style="font-style: normal"> at times. </span><span style="font-style: normal">Stifling</span><span style="font-style: normal">, some would say.”</span></p>

<p class="cnNlMmY2ZWU5MGUzNDRlMmFhZGUzZjIwNzQwZTAyYjdj" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Not that,” I shook my head. “I mean, the fact that it’s a dark side Force nexus.”</p>

<p class="cnM5ZmNmYzkwOTc2MTRlZTlhYzA5ZGVmMmEwOGNkMGNk" style="margin-bottom: 0">The three Masters abruptly lost their humor. Master Kostana shook her head, making the immediate denial, “I’ve sensed no such thing. It is sitting atop a Force nexus, yes, but that nexus is neutral.”</p>
<p class="cnNjYmQ2MzEyMmM4MDQxNWE4Y2M0ZTBlYmU4YWU3MGYx" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnNmODZkYjRhMzgxYjQwNmJiNzI5NmZkMWY5ODU3YzI1" style="margin-bottom: 0">Masters Dooku and Qui-Gon, on the other hand, didn’t immediately dismiss the idea. It was Master Qui-Gon who asked, “What makes you believe that it’s a dark side nexus?”</p>
<p class="cnM1NjM0YTdhMDQwZDQ2YTViZjBlOTUyMjU0ZGM5Y2Ux" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnMwZTg0MTQ3MDFjODQ0YThiNWNhMjUwYjM3MjliMDFh" style="margin-bottom: 0">“The same way one senses the alignment of the Force within another. It’s not trying to hide and it’s blatantly obvious to my senses. I’ve had Ilum and Dathomir both to compare it to. The temple on Ilum is on a light side nexus.” At that, all three of them nodded. “Dathomir is wild, with both light and dark in a natural balance.” I pointed towards the temple. “<em>That</em><span style="font-style: normal"> is dark.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNWE3ODZiYjAwNjQxYjk4MzBlNWExYzcwYWQ1MDAw" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnMyOWViMmEwOWZkYjQ4YzZhYmI4YjllNmJmYjY2MTRm" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">Once more, the Masters exchanged looks as the line moved. Finally, Master Dooku murmured, “And yet, none of us can sense that it’s dark. Describe it for us, Tanya.”</p>

<p class="cnNiMTJhZjNhZmExMjRiODVhNzM4ZmJjYmNhM2MxMmFi" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal">I nodded. “From the outside, it’s like a big shadow, stretching over everything in the area, growing darker the closer you get to the center. It’s gradual and easy to miss if you’re not looking for it. Going in, it’s like passing through multiple layers of veils blocking off the inside of a room. The first few are thin, barely there, but the deeper you go, the heavier they get. Until eventually, it feels like I’ve got one wrapped around my eyes, nearly blinding me. </span><span style="font-style: normal">It impedes my Force senses while I’m inside.</span><span style="font-style: normal"> Worse, when I come back out, it </span><em>clings</em><span style="font-style: normal">.”</span></p>

<p class="cnNiOTg4MjZhYWUyYTRkZmViOGRkNDUxNDIxNTIxMWE1" style="margin-bottom: 0"><em>That</em><span style="font-style: normal"> got a worried look from all three Masters. After a moment, Master Kostana murmured, “That </span><em>does</em><span style="font-style: normal"> sound like a dark side effect, if someone wanted to hide something…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZjVlMmQ2MTU2MDQ5MWQ5YTdhNzFlY2M3MTE4MTMx" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM0YTNmMmEwNDg5ZDQ5OTU5NzA3NWNmMjVlMDdkODQw" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<span style="font-style: normal">Or blind others,” Master Qui-Gon added, earning a nod. “</span><span style="font-style: normal">What could cause such a thing? And why wouldn’t anyone notice?”</span></p>

<p class="cnNhNWU3YjUwYWMyYzQyYWJhZDQ5MmRhN2YyZTgxMTU5" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">Master Dooku stroked his beard as the line moved forward and we found ourselves in the front, waiting on the next car. Finally, he said, “I was taken in as a boy. Most Jedi were brought in as young children. That is the role of the seekers. If it is as Tanya says, and the exposure to the dark side within the temple has a cumulative effect, then it may be possible that we’ve all been partially blinded and simply can’t see it.”</p>

<p class="cnM0YWFiNjc2NjdlYjQxNTdhYWI2NmJkNDM4ZGM5NjU1" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnNhMDlkZTI1YmI5MjQ5MGJhYWUwZjBiOGMzZDhiYTUy" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<em>What has been hidden from us?</em><span style="font-style: normal">” Master Qui-Gon finished the thought.</span></p>

<p class="cnNmZmI3ZDY1YTNkOTRhOGNiZDNhNDlmZTlmMGU5MDNl" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<span style="font-style: normal">Agreed. It could very well have been enemy action some time ago,” the purple woman nodded.</span><br/><br/></p>
<p class="cnNhMTA1YTI1NjNmNzRjNTViMjQyYmQwY2E4MDMzZmNk" style="margin-bottom: 0">Obi and I climbed into the second car and after a few moments, it took off. Sitting beside me in the back seat, she asked, “Do you really think it’s true?”</p>
<p class="cnMwMzFlMzQzMTE0MzQ4ZDI4MWQ3N2FiYjUxYjE0MTMw" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM5ZGIzMmY2ZDVhMjRiZGZhNTAxZjU1NzJjZjA3ZWE4" style="margin-bottom: 0">“You don’t sense it?” I asked, and she shook her head.</p>

<p class="cnM3YjU1YTEyZTgxZTQ2YjRiZjcyMjVmODg5Y2FkMDYy" style="margin-bottom: 0">Frowning, I considered for a moment before taking her hand. “Close your eyes.”</p>

<p class="cnNjMzk5OTI3NWEzMTQ3YWViZjc0MTA4YTRmMDE5ZDE5" style="margin-bottom: 0">She did, and I reached out to her with the Force. It was clumsy, but our practice, meditation, and general comfort with each others’ presence helped. She reached back and, after a few moments, I was able to let her feel the Force as I felt it. Her eyes opened and she looked around, mouth falling open as a <em>disgusted</em><span style="font-style: normal"> feeling welled up within her.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MjMwMTgxOWY3YzRlMzc4ZGI4N2Y5OTE3YzhmYTZj" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0"> </p>

<p class="cnNmMDc3YmM2NjAyNDRhOWI5YTg5NGI4Mjg2NzUxZWVm" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">The rest of the ride was spent in silence, until eventually, we came to a stop. We grabbed our bags and got out, rejoining the Masters. Master Qui-Gon noticed something wrong with his padawan immediately and sent her an inquisitive look. “Is something wrong?”</p>

I will speak with Master Yoda about this before bringing it to the others. Perhaps there is an explanation. Or, if not, a way to stop or reverse it.

It seemed that Dooku and his little expeditionary force had returned. Good!

A brown cloak with the hood pulled up covered my body and distinctive white hair, while gloves and a scarf hid the red skin of my hands and face—just in case I had to drop the camo formula for some reason.</p>

The Force opened up an air vent on the ceiling and I pulled off my pack and leapt up, pulling myself in, before dragging my bag behind me. I closed the vent up and secured it, then slid through the shaft into the room beyond. Casting a quick formula to look at the blueprints again, I followed them to the primary server room.</p>

Only when I was sure no one was around did I undo the vent and drop inside. I took a moment to make sure the room was secure and there were no cameras inside, then got to work. Pulling out my laptop, I connected my hacked together scomp link to the mainframe’s droid data terminal. A quick search turned up what I wanted: planet Kamino, in the Kamino System, in the Abrion sector. I copied the map and nav data to my data disk, then had the server delete it. Once that was done, I ran a new search on a list of terms: attachments, personal attachments, romance, emotion, Jedi code, Force techniques, meditation techniques, and others—such as a few names and dates I wanted to get, out of curiosity.</p>

I could faintly hear the sounds of music coming from the oversized headphones over the human girl’s hears as her head bobbed and she went about sweeping the room. She didn’t look up, nor did she so much as glance at my laptop.</p>
<p class="cnMxODViNjNiMmQ2MTQ3NWI5NTljMTE3MmI4MDZhMDZi" style="margin-bottom: 0"><br/>Eventually, she emptied the dust pan into the bin and left, locking the door behind her and turning the lights out.

Taking out my lightsaber, I prodded the red one into the middle of the repulsor display with the hilt, before hooking it back to my belt and going back to check on my search.</span></p>

As she did, the file transfer she had sent containing a video file of some of the events on Mandalore involving Tanya finished downloading with a beep. “One last question, Ms. Kryze. What is your personal opinion of Tanya Mereel?”</p>
