<p class="cnNkYzZhYjI3MWU4YTRhNTRiMmRkZjg5NzJkMGJlZjc1"><span style="font-weight: 400">No answer comes to me.</span></p>

<p class="cnNlMDNkN2VjNDAyOTRlNWVhOGY2YmU2YzM3YTA2MzA5"><span style="font-weight: 400">The wait ends up being excruciating and to the point that I can’t really keep track of it considering how time is frozen and all. But eventually time resumes again and I immediately find my finger finishing pulling the trigger, sending a bullet straight at the illusion magician who currently looks dazed about what just happened just like everyone else around us. Until the bullet goes straight through his skull.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZGJhMmYzMzZkYzQxZjZhYmUyMmMxMTQ2NDZkMWE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t pay him any mind though as right after time resumes, a screen with some rather foreboding text appears on it. Text that gives me a very bad feeling.</span></p>

<p class="cnM5YzdjMjAwZmY1NDQyOTU5ZjlhYzdjYjkxYjQxZTYy"><span style="font-weight: 400">I stare ahead as the screen with that annoying announcement fades, but despite my standing in the middle of a bunch of enemies and Beta Team standing in the street a few dozen meters ahead, silence fills the entire town. Then the clicking of a bullet magazine snaps me out of my stupor and I move my pistol around and fire another shot straight at one of the remaining soldiers.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YzMyYzc3M2RlOTRlMjVhMjBiYTFhZjUxMGZlMjRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">And the battle resumes after that. Or what’s left of it at least.</span></p>

<p class="cnM4ZDY2ZTY3ZTEyYTQ1NDhiYmM0YjRjODVmZTcwYWUz"><span style="font-weight: 400">What’s this about levels anyways? It mentioned that we could progress in levels by fulfilling our purpose, and that we’d grow stronger both physically and magically if we do. But are levels like ranks or something? Just some sort of numerical value it uses to show how far you’ve progressed your Class?</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZWYxMTI1MTAxMjQ3YmNiN2QyYmVhN2EyOGUxODE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">I purse my lips at that before shaking my head.</span></p>

<p class="cnNhZDZjMjNmMjA2MjRmNWNhYTBmNzJjNDZkZmM4ZWNk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Within a high tower topped with a dome on the planet known as Arc, a woman wearing blue robes lined with gold tightens her grip on her staff after seeing the notification about the final amongst the Horsemen of the Apocalypse. And without hesitation, she begins to scry for the Horsewoman’s location, only to find the scrying blocked by the System itself. So she walks to the edge of the tower, waving her staff to make an entry point before declaring to the entirety of the academic nation known as the Arcadian Society of which she rules over as Archmage, “Fellow mages of the Society! Search with all you have in you! Find Death so that we may keep our well-earned peace!”</span></p>
<hr/>
<p class="cnMzNmRjMjI5MjNmZDQzNThiMTZkZWM3NWE1ZGE2Mjcx"><span style="font-weight: 400">A man with silver hair slowly opens his eyes after hearing the notification. And after narrowing them for a few seconds, he stands up from his throne and sweeps one arm out as he shouts, his own voice echoing throughout the Grand Silvanian Empire of which he rules over and the planet of Silverfall, “Find the threat and eliminate it immediately. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">We cannot have another of those disgusting Calamities walking amongst us!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>

<p class="cnMwOWQxN2Y5YTRjMjRjYTg4OGQyMzNkZTRiZTVmOGZk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Shadows begin to coalesce inside of a dark mansion over a dozen different chairs on an unknown planet following which people cloaked in black appear at each chair. And just seconds later, a man appears floating in the air above the table with his own cloak blowing in the non-existent wind as his voice whispers through all of their minds, “Find her. Bring her to me.” Then the cloaked individuals all bow and vanish in another cloud of shadows.</span></p>
<hr/>
<p class="cnM5YjM3NDNmNGU0OTQzMGE5MjcxMDQ4NDBmMmIyMjA2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Inside of a grand pyramid, in an equally grand throne room, a man wearing a black kilt made of only the best materials suddenly opens his pitch black eyes and grins before he stands up from his throne. Then, to all of the fervent citizens of the Rex Dynasty of the Dead, the Pharaoh declares, “Our Savior has arrived! We must find them and swear our loyalty, for Death is our way!” And in response, all of his citizens fervently respond back, “Death is our way!”</span></p>

<p class="cnM5YWMwYzRkNDI3YTQzODQ4ZDE2ZjAwMTQxMGQ0NWVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Within a grand mansion, a man sitting on a fancy office chair stops playing with the coin in his hand before resuming once again, rolling the coin between his fingers. And after little more than a few seconds, he rings a bell, making a servant enter his room. Then he quietly states, his white hair falling over his shoulder as his white eyes gleam with a dangerous light at his assistant, “The Eternal Dynasty has found a new potential trade partner. Please find and get into contact with them immediately.”</span></p>
<hr/>
<p class="cnMzNjUzMzMxNDY5ZTRhNjhiMzE5NGRhNjIyNTFkOWZm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Sitting on a grand throne at the core of a massive castle beneath a blood moon, a man with stark white hair slowly opens his crimson eyes and stares at the notification about Death’s entry into the System. And after only a few seconds of staring, he slowly closes his eyes again, the only difference in his appearance being the slight tugging on the corners of his lips, drawing them into the start of a smile as he reaches for the necklace around his neck. Where he grabs a glowing red crystal.</span></p>
<hr/>
<p class="cnM4ZTFlMzQxN2QyZjQ3MmU4ZDQ2MDNiZjc3MWM0NTJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, three individuals spread across the universe each show absolute glee at the news.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMzBkNGEzNWMwODRiNDM4Yjc1YjlhOTc0NjM4ZTRl"><span style="font-weight: 400">One of them, a man going by the name of Victor von Lüneburg, otherwise known by the universe at large as Pestilence, pauses in one of his experiments as he smirks slightly. But then he returns to his work just as quickly, his laboratory dead silent like always.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZGRlNjg0ZjQzYTQ1YjZiNmFjM2Y5NDA3MTZkYjNm"><span style="font-weight: 400">The next, a man by the name of Lucius Octavio, otherwise known by the universe at large as War, simply grins while cutting down his foes, his soldiers following behind him in battle without hesitation. And instead of stopping, he simply continues to fight even more fervently than before, the glee and rush of battle filling his eyes and sending terror down his enemies’ spines.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNzU3YjIwMDI2NjQxZDM4Y2ZhMTA5Yjc1MWY0NTc5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Lastly, Ignatius Darkheart, the Terror and Emperor of the Dread Empire, otherwise known by the universe at large as Famine, taps his finger once on his grand throne, then twice, and finally a third time. Then he nods his head, surprising the shriveled and starving nobles kneeling around his throne by his visible reaction.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNTkyODBjMjZiOTRkZjhiMzI0MDc4MTVjMTVmZTFh"><span style="font-weight: 400">And thus, the era of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse begins.</span></p>
