If he had visited some wealthy patrons and </span><em>encouraged</em><span style="font-style: normal"> them to donate to the temple out of the goodness of their hearts, who was I to look deeper into the methods used? I was certain that, as a Jedi master </span><span style="font-style: normal">and a member of the Council himself</span><span style="font-style: normal">, they were all above board. </span><span style="font-style: normal">After all, if no one else on the Council, the Jedi governing body, questioned or complained about the potential use of Force techniques to manipulate the outcome of such a ‘fundraising drive,’ then that was tacit approval in and of itself.</span></p>

Any budgetary savings saw your budget </span><em>reduced</em><span style="font-style: normal"> by that amount the next year, whereas if you went </span><em>over</em><span style="font-style: normal"> budget, your budget obviously needed to be </span><em>increased</em><span style="font-style: normal"> for the next year. It was a truly insane </span><span style="font-style: normal">mindset</span><span style="font-style: normal"> that discouraged saving and fiscal responsibility in favor of irresponsible spending and poor budgeting! </span><span style="font-style: normal">I went on to explain that to master Dyas, almost word for word.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZGNiYTlhNzFhNzQxYzhiMDNjYTdmYmZjMzE2Yzlj" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNjNWE2NzAyNjNjYzRkZTA5NGY0MzJiOWI4NWMyZDc0" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<span style="font-style: normal">I see,” he murmured. “But what if we wanted to keep most of it? Sure, we should absolutely buy a few more ships and pay for the maintenance, repairs, and upgrades on what we have, what with the war coming. Maybe look into buying a bunch of components and supplies we might need and sticking them away somewhere safe for when they’re needed. But what if we needed a very large sum of money sitting around to make a big purchase?”</span></p>

<p class="cnM2Yjk0NDc5M2ExNDQ1MzZhZjU0YjVmZGExYjVmNjYy" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">“Mm,” I nodded, leaning back in my chair. “You remembered the ways I said it would be difficult for any investigator to track down a sum of money if someone wanted to disappear it?” I asked, and he nodded.</p>
<p class="cnNmZmQ3ODYzZmYyMTRhZTdhN2NkMzY2YzMwMWZkOWEz" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM2MmIwZGM4YTJhZjQ3OGZhMTQ4MjkwN2Q1NWNkNmQ4" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<span style="font-style: normal">The process is v</span><span style="font-style: normal">ery similar. When a company does this </span><em>semi-legally</em><span style="font-style: normal">, they do it using what we call </span><em>shell companies</em><span style="font-style: normal">, or subsidiaries. Company A creates Company B, which is a legal fiction. It technically has no employees, no physical location, etc.. Except it</span><em> does</em><span style="font-style: normal"> also technically have employees as </span><em>contractors</em><span style="font-style: normal">—some of Company A’s, in fact</span><em>.</em> Those employees are actually employed by both, at least on paper—if you want to cover all your bases. They may never actually do work for Company B, or if they do, it’s just in the same role as they have in Company A, and you only pay them once because they’re just doing the job you’ve already paid them for as employees of Company A. You then use Company B to sell Company A a service. Information security, internal auditing, tax filing, financial advice, legal counsel, and so on—all <em>services</em><span style="font-style: normal"> instead of goods. Non-physical things, the value of which can then be set and agreed upon between Company A and Company B. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZmQwOTBhNzRkNjQzYTg5MDdkYjhhOWNkYWQ0ZDZk" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNhOGQ5NzZlZDNhMTRiZTdhOTc5NjNmZTkwMTI0ZGY0" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<span style="font-style: normal">Then! You have to pay Company B’s employees. Except, they’ve already been paid once by Company A and they never did more work than they would have under their normal contract. So all of that money can go straight into your pocket. </span><span style="font-style: normal">That way, you get paid twice—</span><span style="font-style: normal">you just make sure to take Company B’s pay out of the payroll for Company A</span><span style="font-style: normal">. M</span><span style="font-style: normal">inus taxes, of course. Taxes are how they always get you. Ironically, the tax collection departments of most governments don’t care if you’re doing crime, only that </span><em>they get their cut</em><span style="font-style: normal">. Many of them have systems built in for reporting profits from illicit gains, just not actually named as such. If you deal in stolen goods, for instance, they have a check box for ‘funds collected for the sale of goods procured through scavenging’ or something like that—the legal equivalent of ‘</span><em>if you say it fell of the back of a truck, then it fell off the back of a truck, and as long as we get our share we’re going to keep quiet about it</em><span style="font-style: normal">.’ </span></p>

<p class="cnNlYmM0NThhMTFlMjRmMmJiNzc0Y2M3ODM0NTEwNjQ0" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<span style="font-style: normal">Then, once you’ve paid your taxes, you stick all of that money in a bank account tied to Company B, completely separate from Company A’s funds and only ever report the </span><span style="font-style: normal">funds</span><span style="font-style: normal"> from Company A </span><span style="font-style: normal">when doing financial reviews for investors—or in this case, those providing charitable donations. Some of them will surely recognize what’s going on, but as it’s a tax deductible write-off on their part, they may be willing to give you </span><em>even more</em><span style="font-style: normal"> money, so long as some of that money comes back to them through some other channel, such as by selling the temple, I mean </span><em>Company A</em><span style="font-style: normal"> services. That ends up in an agreement that looks something like: ‘I will give you X credits, you get to keep a percentage less than the tax rate, then you buy services from my own shell company or you buy all of your goods from me with physical credits tax free and neither of us reports the sale.’”</span></p>

<p class="cnNiMjYwOWFiODUwZDQzODJiODNhOTRiZWFiZTc1M2Uz" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<span style="font-style: normal">Precisely,” I confirmed. “There is are inherent risks in transporting and using large sums of physical credits, however. They can always be stolen. The person you’re buying from can claim to have never received the funds and you can’t have your bank reverse the charge. </span><span style="font-style: normal">Pirates, if you try to take them into space. Sometimes, the bank itself or someone working for the bank may decide they want to collect those credits and may hire mercenaries to take them back. Police using civil asset forfeiture laws because carrying physical money looks suspicious…”</span></p>

Some days, that seems like f</span><span style="font-style: normal">our</span><span style="font-style: normal"> too many, believe me! The one you’ve already dealt with is the Jedi High Council. We’re the ones in charge of everything. </span><span style="font-style: normal">Below us are the Council of Reassignment, the Council of </span><span style="font-style: normal">Reconciliation, and the Council of First Knowledge.

All I’d needed to do was cut out the parts I needed, stitch them together, and make sure they worked together. Then, I’d stuck in the search terms I wanted to look for, along with a command to generate a list of every file on the server so I could look them over and determine if I wanted to come back and get something specific later.</p>

<p class="cnMxODYzNzQ3NjNhODQ4ZjY4MjQ1MWRmYmVkMjM3ODg3" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Yes, well, I’d rather suffer now and be prepared going in than suffer later, go in unprepared, and potentially die,” I retorted, perhaps a bit snippier than I meant to.</p>

<p class="cnNlNGU0YTc1YmUxODQ5YTQ4NzFkZmY5NWMxMmRkNDlh" style="margin-bottom: 0">Obi hummed and nodded, falling back a step. Before I could do anything more than look back to see what she was doing, her hands were on me, rubbing at my shoulders and neck. “Relax~. It’ll be fine. We’ve got plenty of time to prepare. You should take a nap.”</p>
<p class="cnM5ODQ0NmE0OTNlNjQzYTI4NTM0NzUwYjc4ODA5MmIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM1MDcyMTMzODNlYTRhZjNiMjE5MDI1ZTEyZGM1Yjhm" style="margin-bottom: 0">Considering it for a few moments, I nodded. “I will. Once we’re in hyperspace.”</p>
<p class="cnMzYjFiODVhMjY5YzRmNzU5ZDQ0OTBiMDlhM2Q5MWU0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMyMWE5NDZmNWI2ZjRjYTNhOGU2MWI1MGE4MTgwOTQz" style="margin-bottom: 0">She shook her head but didn’t press. We took a pair of aircars to the spaceport. “We’ll be taking two ships for this mission,” master Dyas explained as we arrived. “Just in case we need to split up, or if we need to provide transport and protection. Better to prepare ahead of time for these things, you know?”</p>
<p class="cnNmMzUwM2ZlNTM0YTQwYzlhODI4ZjdhOGFiY2YyZTU0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM0YjFkYmRmOGQ2NTRiNzJhMDdlNTU2MTgyNTA5YmE2" style="margin-bottom: 0">“With that in mind,” master Qui-Gon turned a knowing look on Obi. “Padawan, why don’t you accompany master Dooku and Tanya?”</p>
<p class="cnM5ZGJhYWMwNzc5MzQ3YWU5NTVlNGZlMDk3MWExNzI3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNjNmEyZDVlNzE1NjQzZjhhMWI3ZGI1ZTUxMWRlNTIw" style="margin-bottom: 0">“You’re sure, master?” Obi asked, and he nodded.</p>
<p class="cnM2OGVkOTUxMmYxMjQ5M2Y4OGE5YTFkMDc0MDUwZTcx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM1MWNiMTUwMjY1ZDQwNDQ4YTJlZDBkYmM3ZWI4NGQw" style="margin-bottom: 0">“You can spend the time training together.”</p>
<p class="cnM5YzRiYWYyNTVjNjQ0YjNiOGUyNDc3MDg0MjRmOTc1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNiMmQ2NTFmYzA2YjQ4ODJhODU1ZjRhMDU1NzEyMGY5" style="margin-bottom: 0">Obi beamed happily and gave her master a quick hug in thanks, earning a chuckle from the man. Dooku smiled, shaking his head before turning his attention to me. “Any word on the data?”</p>
<p class="cnMwZTA4ZTkyYzBjNDRiM2U4MTY4ZTQ5ZTZjZDFhMDBm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMwNGJmY2U2NGYwYjQ5ZjZhNTU3NjcyYjA2OTVhZTdk" style="margin-bottom: 0">“My program finished putting everything together last night. I’ll need a couple of days to go over it before I give you my report.”</p>
<p class="cnMxZTczYjE5MDg5ZjRiNTdiYjhiODY3YzkwY2E0YTEz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMwMjY4MThiYWM0NDQwNGY4Y2M1MzBkN2I3M2Q4NDVj" style="margin-bottom: 0">The older man nodded, even as Qui-Gon raised an eyebrow. “Very well. I’ll leave it to you.”</p>
<p class="cnNhNDc5MDc4OTIyNDRlNWFhNjNjM2NiNmMxNzE1YzI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNjMDc4ZDI5ZTdhMTRiY2I4NDRlODY2NjMwMzExYThl" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Do we have time for me to go purchase some supplies I forgot before we leave?” I asked, and Dooku sent me a curious look.</p>
<p class="cnNhNzgyZmNhNjY5MzQ1NzliNTliNzNiNThhZWUxNDU0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNkZDI4NmEyMWVkYzRmMTNiYTM4ZjI4ZjAzMWMwODVh" style="margin-bottom: 0">“What did you forget?”</p>
<p class="cnNlYjBhYzNkNTI5ODQyMTdhODQ0MDVmNDQyZjc2MDIw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMyMDdmOTY4MTA2NzQ4MWQ5MjNmZWU5YWM1NWE3ZDY0" style="margin-bottom: 0">“A blaster. If we’re going to be going into a war zone, I’d like a weapon with more range than a thrown lightsaber.”</p>
<p class="cnM4ZGRhMjgxNTU5ODQ1YWViYzA2ZDAzYzhjZjY1OWZh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNmNTA1NWQ5Y2I3YjQ3YmY5NTJiZDdiOTQ0ZDRjMTlj" style="margin-bottom: 0">At that, all three of the masters chuckled. I sent them a confused look, Obi beside me radiating curiosity. “What’s so funny?”</p>
<p class="cnM2NjFjNTdmZjQyYzRlYWU4ZGM4ZGMwNDRkNWQ3OWQ1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNhNjQwODkyMWExYTRjNjhhMzdhODU5ZTdjODRlY2Q4" style="margin-bottom: 0">“That’s a good idea and we should probably all get some, but,” master Dyas trailed off with a mischievous grin.</p>
<p class="cnNiNzRhMTg5NGI2MDRhNzA4OWE1ZWU1NTc1MDU1Njdh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNhMzFmZTFmMDkyMTQ5YWRiNzNjNGU5NzdlNGM5Njg3" style="margin-bottom: 0">“But?”</p>
<p class="cnM4ZTVlNjg5ZDRhMzRlOGY5ZDRkNWM3Y2EyOTQ3ZjRi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMzZjFhNTFmMGZjNDQ0ZmRhMzc2YzIxYzg5ZGQ4Mjdk" style="margin-bottom: 0">“We’re going to Mandalore,” master Qui-Gon pointed out. At my curious look, he elaborated, “They’re mercenaries and specialize in that sort of combat. You’ll be able to get one there, and they don’t deal in junk. Just as we each construct a quality lightsaber for ourselves and take great care of it, the Mandalorians take pride in their own weapons. While the blaster is certainly not as elegant as a lightsaber, it it not nearly as clumsy as some masters claim. In the end, they’re both tools to be used towards the same goal—keeping the owner alive and completing the mission. They are tradesmen whose trade is war. They know their tools. They will have already sorted through and collected the best weapons for themselves, so anything you get from them will likely be better than what you would find anywhere else.”</p>
<p class="cnMxNDdkZWZiMGRiMzQ0ZmQ5NWMxZjc2ZDQyOTE4NGY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNjZWVmMjA0MDMyZDRjZjJhMWYwOTQyZmI5NzViYWNl" style="margin-bottom: 0">“I’ll arrange something when we arrive,” master Dooku promised, before gesturing towards the ship. “Let’s be on our way. I look forward to hearing what you’ve discovered.”</p>
<p class="cnM1ZjMyYTVjZGY0ODQzMjNhZTJkOTQwMGEzYTlhZTdi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM5YzE5Y2VhNDNkODQ3MDliMTdmMzNlOWFhZTBmN2Qx" style="margin-bottom: 0">With that, we boarded and stowed our gear. Taking my customary seat in the cockpit, with Obi taking the seat directly behind me, I ran through the usual checks then got us into the air.</p>
