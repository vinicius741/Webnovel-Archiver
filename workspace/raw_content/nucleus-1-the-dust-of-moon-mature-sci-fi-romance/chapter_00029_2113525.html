<p class="cnM3Y2NlODFmYWI1NDQ0ODc4ODlkYzk1NzFkMGU0MmFh"><strong><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">17:11, February 10, 2295</span></strong></p>
<p class="cnM5ZGJlNTMxYWFjMzQzMWY5ODI1N2ZkMjc4OWI3MTFk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Near Ananda's Respite, Pasar Kuno District, Nusantara, Borneo, New Indo-Pacific Union territory</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZmY5NmI1NWI4YTRmMjA5ZjcyMzcwYTMyNmEzOWYx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The stone steps descended into the earth, worn smooth by countless footfalls across centuries. Jabari kept one hand near his Combat Knife as they followed Amir deeper underground. The air filled with scents of galangal, turmeric, and wood smoke. Fusion-powered lights cast a warm glow across walls where bioluminescent fungi created shifting patterns.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NDA5ODY5YjcyMDQxOThiMmJlODUzMDA1NzQ5MTk2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Watch your step," Amir called back, his voice echoing slightly. "The people who built this place had their own... particular ideas about architecture."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMGU1NWYxNDZmYTQ1NTJhMGIzYzA2ZDE1YWZjMTZl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari noticed how Amir's eyes constantly scanned their surroundings, like someone used to identifying threats. Despite his robes and spiritual appearance, the Sand Lotus operative moved with the precision of a predator.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYjU4N2I1YTI4YjQ5ZThhN2E5ZDgyOGYzYzBkNjlk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"What ideas?" Jabari paused.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMWJiNmQ5YTUyNzRjOTBiNTY3YWUyNTM4ODQ3YzRk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"See the motifs on the floor?" Amir turned, pointing to where various repeating icons decorated the stone. Each square contained a single creature – a massive cat, a fearsome lizard, and some kind of alien-looking fish.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMDkwNGVjZDQ5ODRlMTE4MjFhZTNhMjk0NmIyYzU0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The cat had distinctive stripes, but its face was flatter than any lion Jabari had seen. The lizard was like no monitor from Africa – its powerful legs suggested it could run down prey. But the fish caught his attention – bulky, armored like something prehistoric, with thick fins arranged more like legs.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NjRmZGU1YjgwMzRlZWVhOWJmNTAzNTIzNWVkNjBh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I see them," Jabari nodded, unable to look away from the bizarre fish carving.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMGZmOTJjNzUxYzRlOTk4MzhlOWJjNTE1NGM1MWJh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Step on the Komodo Dragon, and a poisoned arrow pierces your heart." Amir pointed at the lizard square, then the fish motif. "Step on the Coelacanth, and we'll make you into dinner."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMGE3NGZmZGM3MjRmZjM5ZjUzMmM2ZTdkNDcwOTg4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"What!?" Jabari gasped, stepping backward.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNjA5NzU0MTM4MDQzNDdiYmI4NmZiMWI5MzYzZDg0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Lovely, it's a fight, then!" Wilhelm called from behind him, but with an odd lightness.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NzQ3OWQ4NTc1MjQxN2E5NDU4Yzg2ODYxMTNmZDI5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"To the death!" Amir replied with a broad grin.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYzFiYzQ2NGY3ZjQxZWY5MDYwOWRiNTg2OGU2NGI0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You brought us here to kill us!" Jabari's Combat Knife cleared its sheath in a fluid motion. But as he met Amir's amused gaze, realization dawned. "You were joking."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YTU4YWZlZDBjOTQ0Y2M4YzEzM2M3MGY4OTU0MTQ4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The markings are just decorative these days," Amir said, his smile softening. "At least they will be until I change my mind."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYzNhYzRmYzJmMDRkZjc5OGZjMzZiM2Y5ZjM3YWQ5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">His rings glinted as he flexed his fingers – drawing Jabari's attention to the sigils etched into each band. These weren't mere ornaments; they were tools of some kind.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNGZlMzU4YzYwYzQ0ZjFiMDk1YmYxNjJjNzZmMTli"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"We should leave." Ume's voice cut through the moment. Her amber eyes fixed on a lotus symbol carved into a wall. "The Sand Lotus cannot be trusted."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YTg2NjUxMTBiODQyNDY4YWQyMDdmNmZiZDk5MDY3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Wilhelm turned to her, brow furrowed. "They just saved our arses from a squad of Bloodtroopers. Bit late for suspicion, eh?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMDI4NzBmYjczZTQ0ZjM5NTFjYWU4ZDY1ODU4NjFi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Did we?" Amir's question hung in the air, his earlier joviality replaced by something cooler. "Save you, I mean. I wonder if what we really did was... intercept you."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMzZlNjEzZWJiNzQ0YjA5NWJmMDBiZmJjOWE2M2Yy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Before Wilhelm could respond, Ume continued, her voice taking on a mechanical cadence. "The Sand Lotus engages in human trafficking. They manipulate governments through blackmail. They conduct illegal experiments on children. They promote promiscuity. They—"</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTUxY2UwZDBmYTRiMjRhNGIwYzlmZDVhNzU5ZGU2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Ume?" Jabari stepped closer to her, concerned by her unnaturally steady rhythm.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiODI4MjkwMDRlYzRiNzY5MWU4NjZmMGRmNTg1YWY4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"—harvest organs from political dissidents. Poison water supplies with psychotropic compounds. Practice necromancy on unwilling subjects. They—" Ume continued without pause or inflection, as if reading from an invisible script.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MTY4ZDE4ZTBkYTQ3Njg4MjgwNmRmNTZlODA5MmQy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Her amber eyes remained fixed forward, not tracking any movement. Amir watched with fascination, his head tilted slightly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NGY2ZTdlMjA2MzRiZTJhMjdmM2JkMzhhOWE3ZTll"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"ZenFusion's finest propaganda," he murmured, tracing a pattern in the air with one ringed finger. "Delivered with perfect recall."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMTgzYjIwOTZmNTQwN2Y5NDM1NzllYzhiYzhiOWUw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Ume's eyes fluttered shut, and she stumbled forward as Jabari sheathed his knife, just in time to catch her.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNmZmOTI2OTJmMTRiZDM5ZjcxYjY0OGRkNDg2NzJm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"That's an impressively long list," Wilhelm muttered. "Been rehearsing it on our way here?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMxY2UzN2Q1ZWFiNjRmZGI4MmJmZDI1OWU4N2FlNzBh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I'm surprised 'polygamy' and 'ritualistic rape' aren't mentioned this time." Amir studied Ume with interest. "Perhaps the ones who made you decided those were too enticing to be believable?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NDQwNjk1NjU0MTQ3OWJhYzMxYWJmNzQ5ZDQyMTIw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Is it true? You do any of those?" Jabari demanded, his arms around Ume.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NmFhNjc5OWFjZDRlMjg4NjMxNmE4ZmJjM2FiZjEw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"All of those, according to the media controlled by Imperium of Dragons," Amir's smirk remained. "They would go any length to see those who oppose them slandered and annihilated. The same empire that executes members of our organization and harvests their organs. The one that brands us criminals for believing the divine should remain divine."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MzA3ODY1NGYyNzRkYzZiNTM0MWI4MzFjMGM0NDE2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Amir turned, gesturing for them to follow as the narrow corridor opened into a vast chamber. The air was rich with the aroma of sambal, mixing with pandan and coconut. In one corner, a chef worked at an open kitchen. The other diners – local merchants and Sand Lotus members in simple robes – paid their group little attention.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZDEzNTBiOGI2ZTQ4NjQ4MTE1YmJlNWRhMDU3Njcx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Ananda's Respite," Amir said, leading them to a private booth. "Before the Digital Era's end, before the waters rose to claim old Jakarta, this place served as both restaurant and sanctuary. It still does, for those who know where to look."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNGUzZTc0NjYwYjQzMTE4MWRmZjI5ZDk4NmRlY2Vm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Bloody impressive spot this, but I reckon you didn't save our hides at the market just to show off the local cuisine, eh?" Wilhelm leaned forward, sliding into the booth while scanning their surroundings. His fingers drummed on the ancient wooden table as he tracked the movements of other diners.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTg3MmI1N2I2NjQyZTU5ZDI2ZjVmY2ZiYjg0NmZl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Curiosity." Amir settled into his seat, his rings catching the light as he gestured to a vacant chair beside him. The name 'Fuuka' was inscribed in golden script on its back. "Some things belong to the ancients, not to emperors or federation presidents or oligarchs. Especially not things that can bend minds to one's will."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZWU2YTMxNmY5YTRlMzliZWEyMzJmMjQ4YzljM2Nh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">He paused, looking at Ume's slumped form. "And it seems you may have crossed paths with just such a thing."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOTMzOTE3MTk0ODQzZDM5MDdiOWE1YTEwNzY0OWFj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You alright?" Jabari steadied Ume with a hand on her elbow as she swayed, helping her into the seat across from Amir. Her synthetic skin felt unusually warm.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNTgxOWMzNjdlMjRmMjc5NzcwYmM1Nzg4ZWJmMjRh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"My head hurts. My feet hurt. Everything hurts." Ume pressed a hand to her forehead, slumping against the table. Her eyes remained shut, and Jabari noticed small puffs of white steam escaping her lips as she panted – a response no human would have.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNTdhODUwM2M3NDQ4YjY4MWFkNjg4YjViYThhNTI5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Do you have medical supplies? Anything?" Jabari turned to Amir, concern in his eyes.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YmRiNDM0YjI5NjQ2MDliNjBiZmVkOWE5NjE5MmNl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I might." Amir's expression sharpened as a waitress approached their table, her batik clothing rustling softly as she bowed. The Djinno monk straightened, addressing her.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OTVlYTFmYWFlZjQwMmY5MGViYTA2MDkwOTBkOTRm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"What would you like this evening, Master Amir?" the waitress asked, her pen poised over a paper notepad.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZWNiZTBjNjNhYzRjMDlhNzJjODIwZWVjYWUwYTU3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The usual dinner dishes, plus a sushi hand roll for Sister Fuuka," Amir replied with familiarity, then glanced at Ume as he switched to what sounded like a local language. "*Dan satu gelas coolant standar untuk robot.*"</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MDg1YTU4NTcyZTQ5M2RhNjM5YzViMWY0MjBmYzI2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"*Satu gelas itu? Jadi, wanita itu—*" the waitress's eyes widened as she gestured toward Ume.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YzVhNjQwNzcxOTQxMzA4ZGRlZGQzNWJlMjdhNDc3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"*Sangat mungkin begitu,*" Amir finished, meeting her gaze.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZDM5N2M0MDFmZjRhNzhiZDI3OTBmNDk3YTczZGQy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I will be back shortly." Switching back to English, the waitress bowed before walking away.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NGYwZGRmNGRmMjQxNjlhYjUxNDZlY2ZhMDQ4YTVj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Amir turned back to the group, adjusting his sleeve. "I've taken the liberty of ordering some local specialties. We need only wait for a few minutes."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYjgyYzA0MmI1NjQyMDg5MWY4Mjk2ZWRhM2RkNzE0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Imperium's reach grows longer each year," Amir remarked, breaking apart his chopsticks. "Luckily, antidotes like the Directorate exist. Even in Mumbai, we hear tales of the Kimaris Warband's valor — and ruthlessness."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMjZhNzk3ZGE2NzRlZDU4NGUyNDI2YzU1YzQxY2Q0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"And just how do you know we're Kimaris?" Jabari countered, watching as servers approached with steaming dishes.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNmEzNjQxNjhmMDQyYTA5NDY1YWFmODQxMmQ2M2Y3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The first dish arrived – 'rendang sapi' written on the plate – beef slow-cooked in coconut milk and spices. Following it came 'sayur lodeh', vegetables in a creamy coconut broth with red chilies.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTQwMzk1YzY3ZTQ2YmM5NGE1YmI1ODg2NTY2YmQ3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Other warbands rarely operate independently from the Directorate Space Corps, let alone straying so far from Maridian territories." Amir selected a piece of beef rendang, the meat nearly falling apart. "The question is: what brings Kimaris so far from home, pursuing something valuable enough that the Imperium would send a Bloodtrooper squad to intercept you?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMDA4NWIxMmExZTRlM2Q4NmNjNDYzYzMzM2IwOGRi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Right then, what about you Sand Lotus lot? Proper globe-trotters across the Five Realms, or just stirring up a spot of bother here on Earth?" Wilhelm dipped his spoon into a bowl of sayur lodeh, tasting the tender cabbage.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZDY2NzA1YjZmNTQwODRhZDY0N2RmN2MxYTYyMTlm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"We are…preservationists, you might say." Amir's eyes glinted. "Some artifacts were never meant to be weapons. They exist in balance, like the Five Aspects of psionics. When entities attempt to harness them as instruments of power, the consequences can be catastrophic."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzQ0OWUxY2IyZTQyMzdhMDY4YmM0YzFhMjAwYjg4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Another waiter approached with a steaming pot of 'soto ayam', the chicken soup's turmeric-spiced broth filling the air. Small bowls of white rice were set before each person. There was also a crystal glass filled with yellow liquid.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMDNmMDViNDU3OTQ0NWZhY2UzOTFhNWY0MjU1YzMw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"So you what, spy on the other factions?" Jabari's spoon, with a piece of beef, hung between plate and mouth.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOWY2ZDQ0Y2NjZjRiNDY5NjVmYzY1MzQzNjMyNjA0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"We merely maintain certain interests," Amir ladled the soup into his bowl. "Much like your Chairman Kofi does with his investments in solar-powered technologies across the Five Realms."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhN2UzODVmNWZlOTQ4OWFhMWRkOTBiYWIxMGI0MGEz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari tensed visibly. "How do you know about—"</span></p>
<p class="cnM4Nzg2MjMxMGEzNTRiNzZiOTI3MGQxNWM5OWQ0N2M1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The same way we knew to find you today." Amir lifted the crystal glass. He extended it toward Ume, the yellow liquid swirling. "This is for her. Her system is overloading trying to process something it was never designed to contain."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMzYyNTUyYjZkNDRhODhiYjBjMjY4Zjc0YWQxYjM0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"What's in it?" Jabari's eyes narrowed, his spoonful forgotten.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZWViOWQ0MzhlZTQwZjg5ZTQ1NjExZWU0Y2QzN2I5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"It's just what she needs at this moment," Amir replied. "Something is burning her from within, and it isn't merely a programming error."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMDZiNGUzYTRiYTQ0MDA4ZTZiMDk2YTJkODM4Y2E4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Then I'll taste it first. Make sure it's not poisoned." Jabari reached for the glass, putting down his spoon.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYmQ4MjNhZTQ5ZTQwYjc5ZGYwMWM3ZGNhYzNkZTQw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"That would not be wise." Amir raised one hand in warning. "It's not meant for human consumption."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZDlhY2RkNzUyYTRmMTI4MzEzODc5ZDg4OWRiN2Mz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Hesitant, Jabari turned to Ume. Her breathing had grown more labored, each pant releasing dense clouds of white vapor. Even through his gloved hand on her shoulder, he could feel alarming heat from her skin, like a fusion battery approaching critical levels.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMmYzYzM5ZGE3MDRhNWZiOWZjMjkwMTc4OTUyMDk4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Steady now," Wilhelm murmured, setting his utensils aside. He shifted closer, one arm around Ume's shoulders to keep her upright. Her body trembled beneath his grip.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Nzg1ZjI5NmFkYTQ3ODM5YzZhY2RlOWY0ZTM3NWJh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari's hand shook slightly as he brought the glass to Ume's lips. Her head lolled back, eyes flickering behind closed lids. "Come on, Ume," he whispered, tilting the glass. The yellow liquid initially spilled down her chin, but Wilhelm adjusted her head, and finally, she began to swallow.</span></p><span class="cjNiMTMzZjJjMTBlODQ2ZDdhNGI4M2ZlM2UxOThlMmI5"><br/>This book was originally published on Royal Road. Check it out there for the real experience.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM2ZjZkODI2YmUwMDRjMzNhNTFiZjYzZTMxODA0ZGY2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The change was immediate. Ume's eyes snapped open, a sharp gasp escaping her lips. Her amber irises blazed with patterns of yellow light, like circuit boards coming alive. Dense white steam erupted from her mouth, more streams venting from her ears with a high-pitched whistle.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZDcxYWFiNjhlNTQ1ZDRhNzZiNmY2MWViMGE4NjE3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The nearest diners backed away from their meals, conversations stopping mid-sentence. A merchant nearly upset his soup as he moved his chair away. A couple in the corner exchanged knowing glances, their hands moving to direct the steam away from other patrons. The next table hurriedly requested their bill, while an elderly woman continued eating her rendang, unperturbed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NWJjMTE3MmZmZTQwNmE4MTkwNzJlODk2MmQwNmFk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Ekwensu!" Jabari tightened his grip on her shoulders but turned away, the scalding steam making his eyes water. The smell of heated metal and ozone filled the air.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OGFmYWExMzU2NjRjMGQ5ZWRjZWU0OTg2OWU3ODg4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Wilhelm pulled out a quantum scanner, its holographic display flickering to life. "Her core temperature's stabilizing." He frowned at the data. "What a way to calm a fever, eh?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYTdmOTM4NjdiOTQ3NGY5OTQ1YWVjMzJkOTVjMTc0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"With all the schematic they've stolen from the Alliance, the Imperium is poised to make the most powerful androids of our generation," Amir leaned forward, making a subtle gesture. The steam around Ume began to dissipate quickly, drawn away by some unseen force. "They use this power to create weapons, companions, and vessels."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMzI3ZjQ2YzVkMTRjYmJiMTA5NmIwNjVhZjI1NWRj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"And?" Jabari pushed, meeting Amir's gaze.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OTQ4NTA0OGIzYTQ5NTNhMDBkNWEyZTdkYzUzY2Nm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The monk's eyes narrowed as he studied Ume. "And what you've brought us is a vessel of a different kind. One carrying something far more dangerous than propaganda."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOGQzY2UwYTdjNDQ3M2E4NGY0YWI0N2NjYWQ2M2Y0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Gradually, Ume's trembling subsided, her synthetic muscles relaxing. Her eyes faded to their normal amber as she straightened, the last wisps of steam curling around her face. "Thank you," she whispered, wiping beads of coolant-tinged sweat from her forehead.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjgwZDk4NmFkNTQ1NzVhNWEzODQ1YzcxODA5MzVj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Alright." Jabari grabbed his spoon, eating generous portions of rendang and rice. The rich curry and tender beef helped ground him, though he couldn't fully appreciate the spices through his anxiety. "Will you explain why the Sand Lotus is interested in us?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNlY2E0ZTZlZmY4ZTQxMTRhYjNkY2RmN2MzOThhYzlh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"We are interested in what your android carries," Amir replied, his demeanor shifting from genial host to something more focused. "Data about a particular artifact. One that should remain buried."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYzVmOWZlMDRjNTRiMzk5MjRmZTc2OTg2NTdkYmNh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"What artifact?" Wilhelm asked, though his tone suggested he already suspected.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMTcwY2VjYzE0YzRkMWRhMzM3ZWQyOThiMDFjMmY4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"One capable of bending minds to its wielder's will." Amir's fingers traced patterns on the wooden table. "An artifact whose very existence threatens the balance of power in the Five Realms. One that should be restored to its original form, but never, under any circumstances, used."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NGViZGYxYzdiZjQ2MTVhOWEwN2M1ZDU1YTE5Yjdl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You speak of the Moondust Crystal." A melodic voice interrupted them.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MjhhODY0ODQzMjQ3ZTQ5YmM5MzkxYThmMDMyYmE4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Fuuka stood at the edge of their booth, her refined appearance hiding the calculating intelligence in her eyes. She slipped gracefully into her seat beside Amir.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZjgwYjVlZmYwZjRkYjY4OTBhNDg0MTIwNmNlZDc3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You." Jabari said, unable to look away from her.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMTBmMzUyZWEyZTRlNTJhYzRhYTNlMDVmMzc3ZTYy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Our apologies for the deception earlier," she said, her theatrical accent gone. "But some matters require…verification."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YjY5YjIwNzU3MTQwMTc4YzE4NWRjZjUxZDJiNzhm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You've been verifying us?" Jabari asked, confused.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMjQ1YzUyYjQ1OTRkOTY4ZjU5NzZlMjhlYjc3MzY0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"We needed to ensure you weren't agents of the Imperium," Fuuka explained, folding her hands on the table. "Or worse, unwitting pawns of the Alliance."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlODE5YTM0M2FiNjQ1OWZiYWIxZmYwMWE5YWFmZjk1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"And which are we, then?" Wilhelm's hand had drifted toward his concealed weapon.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDc1OWU5MzdlZTRmOGRhN2NjODJlOGQ2Yzg5ODAy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Neither, we believe," Amir interjected. "Rather, you represent a third power bloc. One that might, under certain circumstances, be reasoned with."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZDk3MDk4OWViMTRkZWE5ZTcyZTQ3NjI5YjYwODdi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Directorate too desires the Crystal. It is known." Fuuka added, resignation in her voice. "But perhaps your motivations might align more closely with ours than the others."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTJmMDEzZjJkMDQ2OWViYWY5NGZjZjI5Y2I2YzE5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Wilhelm's eyes narrowed. "And what exactly are your motivations?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMDg5M2U5MTFiOTRlNjE4ZGM1N2I2NDE4N2Q3ZGY4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"To restore what was broken, but ensure it never falls into the hands of those who would use it as a weapon," Fuuka replied, looking at Ume. "The Crystal was created by beings far wiser than humanity. It was never meant to control or dominate – only to guide and balance."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxODljZjhjNGVmODQ3OWQ4Mzc5NWJjNThiNGVkOThk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Interference patterns exceeding normal parameters," Ume suddenly announced, her voice mechanical again. Her amber eyes flickered with unusual patterns. "World, History, Omniscience — other shards scattered. Dargoth sleeps beneath Io's crust. The Hivemind speaks! Nirbohs know Harald's betrayal. Eclipse magic flows through jade corridors —"</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZTc5ZGFkZTU0NzQwZjY4YzA0OWYzOGNhNDAyZDU2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Fuuka's hand shot out with startling speed, her palm coming to rest against Ume's forehead.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOGZiODY5ZTI1MzQyNGNhZDg1YmNhZWFlNzU3NzA1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Śāntiḥ," she whispered, and a faint green glow emanated from her fingers.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MjdkOTNiOWM5NzQyNGVhOWJiZDRiYmEyODk3MWYy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Ume's recitation cut off abruptly, her eyes returning to normal as she slumped back.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOGMwMjNhZDVhOTQyNmViYTlmNzdiMjdkYzM2MDE1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Just as I suspected," Fuuka said, exchanging a look with Amir. "The android carries more than mere coordinates. She has been imprinted with a fragment of the Crystal's consciousness."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMjQxYTMzNTliZjRlMWNhODJjMWQxMTU1N2M5MGFj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Moondust Crystal... has consciousness?" Jabari asked, incredulous.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZWUwZjQyMTE4OTRmOGZiN2QxOGIzNjJlNmQ1YTVk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"All things of power do, in their way," Amir replied cryptically. "But what matters now is that your companion carries information that could lead to the Crystal's misuse by factions who see it only as a weapon."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMjI5YWI0ZDg0YjRjYjBhMmRiZGMxYTRjYzA0NWU2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Fuuka's expression softened as she regarded Ume. "The strain on her system is immense. Her positronic matrix was never designed to contain such power."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MTQyNGFmZTAzMzRlNjU5NzVmMmI3YjhkN2VmNWVl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Is there anything you can do?" Jabari asked, concern for Ume overriding his wariness.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMTQxOWM2YzNmYTQ3NWY5MWEyM2UzZGM2YzcyNTk3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Perhaps," Fuuka said, her brow furrowing. "But first, we must understand each other clearly. The Sand Lotus seeks to prevent any faction from weaponizing the Crystal. We believe it should be restored to its complete form and then hidden away, protected from those who would abuse its power."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMjE3OTJkYzEyZjQwMmJiNzcxYTY1NTkyNjkyZmY1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"And what would the Directorate do with it, I wonder?" Amir asked, tapping his rings against the table.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOWNkNGZiMTA1NTQ2Njc4ZGVlODliYzIyZDMxZmY3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Before Jabari could answer, several robed figures emerged from the shadows. Their white and copper-toned armor gleamed in the dim light, curved blades held ready. They positioned themselves around Jabari's table in a tightening circle.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OTFmZmM4YmFlZDQ5YjFhMmJlOTMxYmZhNzE4NTRm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Moondust Crystal's location, compressed and housed within a Da-Ji android." Fuuka's voice remained calm as her warriors closed in. "An ingenious solution, but ultimately a dangerous one. The question now is whether your Directorate can be trusted more than the Imperium or Alliance."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YjBhMzA4MGVkZjQyOTVhOTA1MTAxMjcyOWI3ZTkw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"What is this?" Jabari demanded, his hand moving toward his Combat Knife.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMWY5ZWJiNWUwMDQ5OTI5MTIxN2MwOWVlZjlhZWNm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Insurance," Amir replied simply. "The Krypts are merely ensuring our conversation remains productive."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZWE4YjYyOTAyYjRiNjM5MGQ4YWJiNDgxZWI2M2Rj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You speak of trust while surrounding us with armed guards?" Wilhelm's tone was light, but his eyes had turned cold.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZDI1MTNlOGNjNzQxNjU4YzgwMWI0ZjFlMGMyMzVh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Trust must be earned," Fuuka countered. "And the Crystal's power is too great to risk on blind faith."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZTU0YzgzYzQ2ZDQyYWVhNTNmZmNmMjlhOWZhY2Zi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"We saved Ume from a memory wipe," Jabari said, anger in his voice. "She chose to come with us."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNzQzMTc0YzhmNDRhZWNiNDIzYWU5OTA4ZmMwNWZh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"A noble gesture," Fuuka acknowledged. "But nobility and wisdom are not always the same. The data she carries could destroy worlds if misused."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOTViZjhlOGJjYTRlYzhhZGE0MDBhMWI1MzI0Yjc3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari glanced at Ume, who watched with frightened eyes. "What do you want from us?" he asked finally.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMjVmNmU4ZDNiMjQzYWQ4YzE1NzQyNWYyYzEwZWM1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"An alliance, of sorts," Amir proposed, leaning forward. "The Directorate is the least objectionable of the major powers, from our perspective. Work with us to restore the Crystal, but agree that once whole, it must be sealed away. No faction should wield its power."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Y2FiYjQxNzk1ODQ1MmRhZDJlYjJiYTQyYmUwZjIx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"And if we refuse?" Wilhelm asked, his hand now resting openly on his holstered weapon.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NmNmZDFmNzQ0MTRkMzE5MzdlODIwZGM1N2RkYjBj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Then we would be forced to extract the information ourselves," Fuuka said, her gentle tone at odds with her words. "A process your friend might not survive."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkY2Y0ZTg4MDRiYjQ2YTNiOTEzZWM3OGZiNGNmN2Ew"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The air seemed to thicken with tension. Several robed figures at nearby tables had stopped their conversations, watching the drama unfold.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MjFkNGEzMzgzOTRjYmY4OWQ4MmQwNGVlYmIyNjYw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You should not be entrusted with such data," Fuuka continued, her serene demeanor unchanged. "But neither should the Imperium or Alliance. We offer a middle path."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OTVmMTMxZWNlNTQyNTVhZjhlNmI3ZTU2ZjRiYmVj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Why not?" Jabari assessed their situation. At least eight hostiles, all with identical curved blades and lightweight armor that favored mobility over protection. Their coordinated movement showed extensive training – these were no common mercenaries.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNDBiNWI0Y2UzYjQ4ZjJiMGY3Njk5MzA0ZmExMGYz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Wilhelm's hand found his holstered Plasma Handgun. "Bit crowded in here suddenly, wouldn't you say?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Y2Y5OTE2MDAwZDQwNGRhOTQzMTZkMmIzYTgyZWMw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Many of our Krypts are trained in the deserts on Venus." Fuuka gestured towards a blade-wielding warrior next to her. "You two are handsome enough. I'd hate to have you slain."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlM2RlYTgwZDYxNDQ2ZDY5Y2U2OGNkNzc2NDJlNmI0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Bad form to draw weapons at dinner," Wilhelm's tone remained light even as he sized up their opponents. "Especially when we haven't finished the tasty beef."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2M2NiMDE1MWUyZDRjMzdiZWM4NDQzZDk5ZGI0MWU3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The tension was broken by an explosion that rocked the chamber. Dust and debris rained down as the restaurant's entrance burst inward. Through the settling chaos strode a woman in a black-gold uniform, flanked by crimson-armored Bloodtroopers with Thermal Battleaxes.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZDA1ODI2MDI2NDRmYzY4ZjRhYzEwOGQ2YWU0NDY1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Your old makeup was better, Fuuka." Marisol's cultured voice carried across the destruction, "I should've guessed you Sand Lotus fanatics would be involved."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMGYxYmYyZjUyMjQ2OTNhNjJkOTBkNjAxOTU2NDk1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Marisol." Fuuka turned to face the new threat, her smile dripping with sarcasm. "I see you brought your favorite pet. Did Dilinur need much convincing to let him off his leash?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZmRhYTUyZDU2ZDRmNGJhMzk0OWFkNDRjZTk1NzFl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Cheng arrived by a teleporter. The local authorities were wise enough to stay out of our way." Marisol's smile remained as she strode forward.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZTdiZmRiYjBhMzRlZWU4NWM0NWNjYWQwYjY3NzNi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Behind them, Ume gasped as a new figure emerged from the dust cloud. The man who stepped through the ruined doorway commanded attention through sheer presence. His crimson armor, more ornate than the Bloodtroopers', bore intricate dragon motifs. But it was his face that struck Jabari — carved from pure arrogance, with sharp cheekbones and determined eyes.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYjZhN2NiMTU4NTQyNWQ5NzhlODlhMjljYWJlZDIx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"U6-M9. Prefect Altai has demanded your retrieval." The officer's gaze fixed on Ume, and Jabari felt his grip tighten on his knife.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNDc2NjY2MzU4MjQyYmNiYjVhMWM5YTA3OTc3ZTI1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The restaurant erupted into violence. Krypts and Bloodtroopers clashed - curved blades against Thermal Axes.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MDk5MzA0MmNjZjQ3NjI4ZGZjNjA3ODkxYzc3MTZl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Marisol drew a weapon that seemed out of place - an ornate Lever-Action Rifle with silver and brass fittings. Its polished wooden stock bore floral engravings, while the barrel gleamed with damascus-steel patterns.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMDFjMzFjODM0ODRlYmE5ZmFiY2Y1NmU0MTdiNTgx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As she took aim at Fuuka, Jabari muttered in disbelief. "That medieval gun? In this century?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTRkZmFiYzhmMzQ1MDhhOWM3MmE2YzI4NDY5YTJm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Sólskjöldr Vörn!" Fuuka chanted, deflecting the first shot with a barrier of golden light. But she had to dive aside as the next round punched through the stone pillar behind her, leaving a hole large enough to fit a fist.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZGIzOTY2ZTZiNjRmZjc5OTNmNGU2ZDc1YzhiNWUz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Wilhelm, get Ume out of here!" Jabari shouted, fighting his way back through the chaos. A Bloodtrooper's axe came down in a burning arc, forcing him to roll away. The superheated blade left a glowing trail where his head had been.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OWQ5OTZlZjEwNjQzMGI4ZWVlOTcxODQ4YjAzZGY0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Bit occupied at the moment!" Wilhelm fired his Plasma Handgun in controlled bursts, keeping two Krypts at bay. But Cheng Wei advanced steadily through the firefight, shrugging off energy bolts.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NWIxNmZiOTU4NDQ2YjZhNThkOTFlZDBlODM1OWQx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Ume backed away, her amber eyes wide with terror. "Please, I don't want to go back—"</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOTY4MjA3N2U5MTRjMDBiOTFmZWMwZDIzMTUzYmUx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Return to your rightful place, U6-M9!" Cheng's commanding voice thundered over the din. A Krypt rushed him with a curved blade, only for Cheng to catch it with his gauntleted hand.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MmUzZGUyZGMzZTRmOTQ5ZjdhMWUwZjVhZmE5Njcz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Your defiance ends, terrorist!" The steel shattered in his grip as he cast the broken weapon aside.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ODFlMTE3OGRlNDRlOGY4NDJkNjRiMjNlYWFhY2Yy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari lunged forward, Combat Knife aimed at what seemed like an opening. But the Seneschal's martial prowess was beyond anything he'd faced. Cheng caught his wrist mid-strike, and pain exploded through Jabari's arm as titanium-reinforced fingers clamped down.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNzk4ODlhNWNkODQyYzM5NzE2ZmJkMTMzMzZmNzgy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Your spirit burns bright, Directorate warrior!" Cheng's face lit with fierce appreciation even as his grip tightened, forcing Jabari to drop the knife. "But the Imperium's justice cannot be denied!"</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MWE2MDE2MzQ3ZTQzMzk5YmE0YTU2N2FmY2NjNjBi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">His other hand shot out, seizing Jabari's chest. The throw sent him flying across the restaurant. He crashed through a table, wood splintering beneath him. His vision blurred as he tried to stand, only to see a Bloodtrooper's Thermal Battleaxe descending.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZTM1MjdmZTM5ZDRhNjJiMjQxMjNlOTRmODk5YWYz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"No!" Ume's scream pierced the chaos.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZjk2ZDA3NDk4NzQ3MTU4MzAwNmRhYjAzYzI4OWE1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari rolled desperately, but not fast enough. White-hot agony lanced through his side as the axe caught him, burning through fabric and flesh. The world spun, darkness creeping at the edges of his vision.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3N2NlZjJjMWE0NDQ0OTk4NjQyMjg5ZTA5M2VkOWQ5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Through the haze of pain, he saw Marisol grab Ume's arm, pulling her toward the exit. Wilhelm tried to intervene but took a brutal strike from Cheng that sent him sprawling.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZjk1NDdkMzVmODQ2OWQ4ZThmZmE3ZDQyNzQ5MzJi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Form ranks!" Cheng bellowed. The Bloodtroopers fell in around their leaders, axes raised high as they retreated with their prize.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MzVhZDAxMmM4YTQ0ZjZiZjFlYjA2Y2QyM2FhYTQz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Ume..." Jabari reached out weakly, his body refusing to move.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMWJiM2U1NGZmMTRmOGVhOWQwYWZkYTVhNDU3MDJh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Across the room, Fuuka dispatched a final Bloodtrooper with a swift gesture. Her eyes met Jabari's, and something passed between them – a recognition, perhaps. She glanced toward the retreating Imperials, then back to Jabari's wounded form.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMTg2NmJhNmY5MjRlNDNhOWE0OTQ0NDg0OTVmMTIw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Decision made, she knelt beside him, her hands glowing with healing energy as she chanted. "Surakṣitaḥ Asi."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMzhhMzU5NTRlNjQyNWU4YzViZTNkMjY0ZDIyZmZh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As the warmth of her spell flowed through him, closing his wounds and restoring his strength, Jabari looked up at her in confusion. "Why help me? I thought you wanted the data too."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyY2IxODIzOWI2MjRlYTRiOWRhZTQwMTljYWY0NjA2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Imperium cannot be allowed to possess the Crystal," Fuuka replied quietly. "Of all evils, they are the greatest. And you..." she studied him, "have strong reasons."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ODQ0ZjcwYWU2MTQ3YzViN2EwMmM4YzNjMzE0YzIz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I won't let them harm Ume," Jabari rose to his feet, testing his newly healed side. The flesh was tender but whole, Fuuka's magic having knitted the wound completely.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMWJmMmU4Y2RiODRhYTY5ZjcwZTFkZWJiYTNiM2Vj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Then pursue them, we will," Fuuka assured him.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YWQ0MzY2N2Y2NTQxNThiYTY3ZmFjNWE0MjUwODU0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Wilhelm limped over, a hand pressed to his bleeding forehead. "Changing sides already, are we? Just minutes ago your lot were ready to gut us like fish."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4Y2FiYWY4ZDcyNjQ0NzE4OTlkMDk3ZTVhZWQ2NzQy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The equation has shifted." Amir replied, emerging from behind a collapsed pillar. Despite the destruction, not a single fold of his emerald robe appeared disturbed. "With the Imperium holding both your android and the data she carries, we face a common threat."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOTIyYmQ1MGJhNzQxYzJhZjI5ODFkMjllYmI4Mjc1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"A temporary pact? With handshakes?" Wilhelm quipped, holstering his Plasma Handgun.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDJhNWZiM2QyNjRmYWViN2NjMWMxNWI2MDY2YTUy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Amir nodded slowly. "We help you recover your friend, preventing the Imperium from accessing the data she carries. In return, you agree to work with us toward restoring the Crystal."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYmM1YjNmNjUzODRhMDdhYTQxYjk3ZTVjNzkyYmU1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"And after it's restored?" Jabari asked, eyes narrowed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlM2M2MDBmMGZkYzRlMTg5NjVkYTdmZWU3NDhmYzk5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"That discussion can wait," Fuuka answered as she placed a hand on his chest plate, her eyes meeting his with new resolve. "First, we prevent immediate catastrophe."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZjBhYjI0OGViODRhMDM5MTczZWIzNmZlODhiZjFm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Wilhelm ran a hand through his hair. "Seems we've gone from dinner guests to unlikely allies in record time."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMzZmMDE1NjRmOTRmYjI4NzYxNTdjMmZhNTY2MThi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Effective, though, isn't it?" Amir replied with the barest hint of a smile.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNjRiYTRlOTk2MzQ0YjJiYjg5YjEyNjUxMjY3Nzcw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari looked around at the destroyed restaurant, the fallen warriors from both factions on the floor. Blood and scorched stone mingled with spilled food, the earlier tranquility shattered.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OWRhNzQ4YjQ5NTQ1YjU5OTRiYjVjN2VhYzUxMzk5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Next time," Wilhelm remarked, wincing as his fingers touched a tender spot. "Let's skip dinner and go straight to the alliance part, hey?"</span></p>
