<p class="cnMxNjEyNzc3YzlmMTRmOWZhMzFlYjlmMDRkNzNiOTEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn woke up feeling very much refreshed, despite the early hour. She’d forgotten how nice it was to have a good cry and sleep, and she’d been lucky enough to have a dreamless sleep; if she’d had a nightmare about the Undead after all that, Maeryn wasn’t sure she’d have been able to muster the energy to get out of bed. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0MDBmNGZhMGIxZjQ5MmJhZWZlMmRkNDA5MGJmZGNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">But it hadn’t happened, and she had a job to do. Frankie was gone - had she even slept last night? Maeryn had no idea. Maybe she’d ask when she saw her. Continuing onward, she woke Dan up with a sharp rap on the door that connected their rooms, and quickly changed into her airship captain uniform. Much to her surprise, the uniform was slowly… loosening up? Or maybe she was adapting to its constricting jacket. It didn’t feel as wrong as it did before. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZmM1Mjg3YTE3ZDRiZDc5YjNiNDI2MmNmNWU2ZmFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe it’s like shoes that you have to wear in,” she muttered. “Fresh off the rack is uncomfortable, but wear it long enough and it starts to suit you? I feel like there’s a moral there somewhere.” She glanced at her new hat sitting on the desk and shuddered. “But I’m still not gonna wear that.” Shaking her head to refocus, she threw what few things she had back into her satchel - reluctantly including the hat just so she could stash it away on the airship and never look at it again - and hurried downstairs. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzYmViNzNlYmRjYTRmMWRiZjE5YjYwYmY0Njc0NzQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Gerald looked up at her as she arrived at the main floor. “Ah, good morning, Captain. How did you sleep?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNTBiOTk2MzRjZDQyZDI5YTczYTAyNGUyM2UxODE3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Quite well, thank you. Just so you know, my crew and I will be out today, and I’m uncertain if we’ll be back tonight. Please don’t be alarmed if that’s what happens.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwMzQzNTNkZjVhNzQ1YzA5NGIzNzZkMDA5ZDk3NWZl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, I understand. You’ve got your duties as a captain to consider.” Gerald nodded sagely. “I do appreciate you letting me know, though. May the wind stay at your back.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNWM4MzU0MDY3NzRmZjM4ZjY2NTAzMWM3MmRmZWIx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And may the people be thirsty for your ale,” Maeryn replied with a smile. She’d heard enough of the traditional farewell in her time in Zephyria to understand that it was perfectly fine to craft your own response, and often appreciated so long as it wasn’t too over the top. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3YjFmNDYzMGNlZDQ1NmVhNmYxZjZjZjM5Yzg3Mjhl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Gerald laughed. “Ah, if only!” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzNTc3NTY1ODFiNDQ5YTVhZTdmNjA4Y2ExNTk4Zjky"><span style="font-weight: 400">Feeling a little proud of herself for making his day a bit brighter, Maeryn exited the inn and quickly hurried to the airfield. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1Y2JjYjIzNGRmZjRjNzhiY2RiNTNmOTMzZDRlOWM1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite having arrived early - she even checked the nearby clock, it was six forty-three - Ernesto was waiting outside of Stonewing with a large duffel bag. Maeryn blinked - that was a lot to bring for what was supposed to be a single-day trip, but maybe Ernesto was angling to be able to stay with Graves when they got there? Whatever, it wasn’t her business. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlNGIzYTdlMmQ4ODQyMDU5YjNjYzJhYzY4MzFmYjI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto straightened when he saw Maeryn approach. “Captain Maeryn! I, um, I’m not too early am I?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYjI4OTRhMjAwYTRhOWM5NmQ0MjQ3ZTEwODFmMjA2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re fine. Welcome aboard.” She gave him a quick tour of where he was permitted - the kitchen, the central area, and the cockpit - before having Ernesto pick one of the unoccupied rooms to put his stuff in. She carefully didn’t mention Terrance’s room as an option, hoping that the rogue would find his way back to them, but Maeryn had to admit she was a little disappointed he hadn’t been there when she arrived. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhZDA2NmM3YjA4MDQ1OTRiYmYyODgzMzk3MzAyYTY3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And over there is Dan’s lab. Off limits to everyone, including me. He’s my Research Master and my Alchemist, so what he says goes regarding the lab. Got it?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwNDQ1NmEzMzhkODQ1NzliMDI4YmIwMzZjYzAzZmM5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto’s head bobbed up and down rapidly. “Yes, Captain! I understand perfectly! Those are the same rules that Master Graves gave me when I first apprenticed to him, so there’s no confusion at all!” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwOWYzNWY5OWE0OTQzMGM4NzUyOWE3ZGQxOWM0ZDY2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good. Follow the rules and we’ll have no trouble at all. Now, where did Frankie get off to…?” Maeryn muttered. She hadn’t seen the engineer yet this morning, and she was starting to get worried. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxZmVhNzQ0OWJjNjQ4OWRiM2Q4ZjliYTcwOTVjNDM0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is Frankie, ah, your engineer, Captain?” Ernesto asked tentatively. “I saw her shortly before you arrived. I believe she’s, um, making a quick run to the airfield supply depot to get an up-to-date map? Of the known world?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZTg5ZDVmMzk1NjQ4ZGZiNmFhOTExYzZjZmU4MmI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh. Well, that’ll be convenient, actually,” Maeryn commented, a little surprised. “Right then. She’ll be back quickly then?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNjA5NzM5Y2NlZjRiZDViYzc0YzY2ZDhjMDI3NGE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh yes! It’s that building right over there.” Ernesto pointed out the cockpit at one of the nondescript buildings on the edge of the airfield. “She should be back any minute.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZjM3ZWMxNzJmMjQ3YTNiM2Q5M2QyODMxMWM4NjRi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn nodded, and when she peered outside, she could in fact see Frankie hurrying back with something long and tube-shaped under her arm. The map, no doubt. Similarly, she could see Dan a little further out, walking briskly to the airship. They’d both be on board in a minute or two. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjMjUxMjA4ZmVmMTRiNWRiNmM0NWVmMmIyYmI2NWYy"><span style="font-weight: 400">She turned to Ernesto. “We’re going to be taking off shortly. Are you prepared? You have Graves’ location?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0ODA0ZWYzODgwMjQ0MjE5ZGY1M2NjMDA2OTc5YmVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto swallowed and nodded. “I, I’m prepared, Captain. And I’ll be sure to mark it on the map for you so there’s no mistake.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwOWY4ZTc4ODRlZDRhNzhiMzcyYjVlMGUyNzVlNzc0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heya Captain!” Frankie greeted cheerfully as she hurried inside, immediately turning towards one of the walls of the central area and unrolling the tube under her arm, revealing a very large, crisp, brand-new looking map that Frankie immediately pressed against the wall. Somehow, the map immediately stuck in place without re-rolling in on itself. And when Maeryn took a closer look at it, she was astonished to realize that the map had actually been placed perfectly level. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyZjBhNWI3NDZkNzQ4ZWNiMTE0NjNkNDNkYTFjMzE3"><span style="font-weight: 400">She glanced at Frankie, more than a little impressed. Maeryn certainly wasn’t capable of placing anything level against the wall the first time, let alone something as unwieldy as a paper map. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0NmI0NDQ5MjkyMjQzZDk4NDJlNzcyYzY3N2JjN2Zm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Frankie reached into her satchel and withdrew several… figurines? “What are you…?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlMWI1ZWU0MjBkOTQwZmJhNzc2ZjIyMzNiNTEyZTMz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Frankie rapidly placed an airship figurine labeled “Cloudreach” against the map, placed some distance away from a section of the map that Maeryn recognized as a zoomed-out representation of Lodestar, where they’d started. Much to Maeryn’s astonishment, the figurine stuck in place with no effort at all, seemingly defying gravity. “What the… What?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwY2UxY2VhNTYyNTQ0NmZiYmQ4OTU3OWUyOTZjMzZl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, it’s simple, really. They’re magnets,” Frankie explained. “Some kinds of stone and metal are attracted to each other. Nobody really knows why, but turns out that airship metal works well with ‘em. This lets people keep an up-to-date map of where the flying cities are, by moving the magnets around when ya need.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzZTNhNWYxYTc2ZjQwMmRhZjU1NWJjNTRjYjZhZjBi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn blinked, then sighed. She’d heard of magnets before, but she’d never actually seen the effect in person. Most of them were snapped up by the Alchemical Workshop in Geova for studying magnets and magic and the effects they had on each other. But she could see how convenient having such a map would be. “Alright then. Ernesto, please indicate on the map where Graves’ research site is.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhZDljZDViN2QwODQxODlhZGZkNTRiZDFkMmY2Mzk2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Frankie helpfully gave the assistant a magnet with a stylized target on it, and Ernesto took it absently as he studied the map. Then, carefully, he placed it on what looked like the middle of a mountain range. “There. About midway up Mount Peace.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhYTU0MGRjOTU2MzQxNjlhYTE1N2I2ZTI2MTVjOThl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A curious name for a mountain,” Dan commented, walking aboard. “Oh, a map. And magnets for markers! An intelligent use of them, I admit. Is everyone here?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM2YWI0NzhkZWMwMjQ0ZmZiYzI1NGJjYmJkYmRhM2Ix"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Everyone who we’re expecting,” Maeryn answered. “Frankie, warm up the ship. We need to get moving.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlYjZkM2EyZGQ4ODRjZWVhMWM0OTY3Zjk1OGI1M2My"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aye-aye, Captain.” The engineer finished putting another of the figurines on the map, this one clearly a flying city labeled “Airspire”, took all of a second’s examination to make sure it was reasonably correct, and then bounced over to the cockpit. Maeryn wasn’t sure </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">how </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Frankie was so sure about the position on the map - maybe there’d been an up-to-date version in the supply depot, and she was just placing them via memory? It was still impressive without a reference handy. </span></p><span class="cjdjZTc3YWU3ZjkyMjRmYjBiY2YyNDM4M2Y1ZTVjZjc1"><br/>The story has been taken without consent; if you see it on Amazon, report the incident.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNjNGI3ZDZlMzY3NTRkNTE5ZDczNGQ4ZDdiODU0YzU1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right then. Ernesto, if you have time, I’d like to pick your brain a bit about your Master. Shall we enter my lab?” Dan offered easily. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDk2NjM0NmM5NjRlOTliODNhMjlhZTBhNzE1YjU1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I, um, yes! Are you sure, though? I mean, it’s… your lab…” Ernesto was so visibly nervous that he was almost shaking in place. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1YWY0MzhkMjVkMjRkNzM5ZDExZmQxNTY1MTg0YTgz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine. All of the volatile ingredients are put away. As long as you only touch what I say, no harm will come to you.” Dan put his arm around Ernesto’s back, guiding him towards the lab. The two vanished into the room, the door closing softly behind them.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNDgzMTZhMTIyNzRlNDliZTMyMThkZjkwNWJiZGI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn stared after them, not sure whether she was envious of the hapless research assistant or scared for him. After a moment, she nodded to herself. “Both. Both is good.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3YjkzMGI3YTU5ZTQ0MTI4NmJiMTQ2MzA2ZmVjZWQw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Deciding to put it out of her mind for the moment, she sat down in her chair in the cockpit. “Alright, Frankie. Tell me the truth; did you sleep at all last night?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3YzNlMTJlZWQ1YTRmNGQ5MDM0OGU0M2ZiNTkxOTkz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yep!” the pilot chirped. “A whole two hours!” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0M2E1MjM4MmRkZTRkMGY4ZjllYTE4YWFhMjhhMmRj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn stared at her, shoulders slumping. “You do realize that two hours isn’t enough sleep for anyone, right?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZjk3YTdlM2NlYjRmZGM4NzM3YmJhOWJjNGI2NGNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Frankie’s usual energy seemed to peter out. “It’s… it’s all I could get, Maeryn. Don’t worry, I rested and relaxed as best I could. I’m fine. And I’ll tell you if I need you to fly. I promise.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiMTc5MWNmZTAzZjQ0ZTVhMmY4NDA0YmM3NjIxOWEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn sighed, rubbing her temples. “Alright, but you’ve got to take better care of yourself. We can’t afford anyone burning out, especially you.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDk3NTE5M2M4NjQ4MWE4MWZhMGIxZTEwMTc2ZWRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Frankie nodded earnestly. “I know, I know. Just… a lot on my mind, I guess.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMDVhYzlkNDM0NDQ0OWU4ZDEyZWRlZGZiNzFjNDEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You and me both,” Maeryn murmured in agreement. “I’ll make you some of that roasted trail mix with Luminwing jerky you like so much while we’re flying to keep your energy up, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzM2QyMmRiNTMwYzRmMjZiOGI1YjhhM2U5YjU1NDE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">At the mention of her favorite snack, Frankie’s eyes lit up. “Oooh, yes please! You’re the best!” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhYjgyYzE1MWM3ZDQ2Nzg4ZmZlM2EyODNkMTZiZDEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">With that decided, Maeryn let the matter drop, and watched through the cockpit window, where some of the airfield crew was preparing for their takeoff. She knew better than to hope, but some part of her still wanted Terrance’s figure to appear and flag them down. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhZjRlMzJhOTVmZDQ2ZmU5YTk2OTBiNzI3NjI3NzY2"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Stonewing’s all warmed up.” Frankie’s voice was soft, but insistent. “We’re ready to go.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyZGQ2YmI0NTgyNzQ3Yjg4YWNhZDNhZGEzZjA2Mjdk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn closed her eyes. “Get us out of here, Frankie.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzNmMyYjA0OTc0NTQ5Y2FiYTY1YTc1ZDE5MzE5ZDEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aye-aye, Captain.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3YjdiNDRhNTJjMzRjZjNiNzU2MWJiNzIzNWZlNzdi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Shortly thereafter, they were in the air, flying towards Mount Peace. “Frankie, what’s our timeframe? When should we be expecting to arrive?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmZWM0OWQxNDA4NjQzNDI4NTljM2U2NGRmNjc4MmU5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s not too far, and Stonewing’s pretty fast. Considering how quickly we got from Cloudreach to Airspire, and the relative distance…” Frankie was obviously doing some mental math before finally deciding on an estimate. “We’ll probably be there in about five hours or so. Just around lunchtime.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyZTkzMmFmY2RhYzQyOTlhZDk2N2ViZjE3MjNjMjlk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn nodded in acknowledgment before rising from her seat. “I’ll go get your snack ready.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNkYWRlYTk0ZmM0YzRkNzRhOWNmYzYwMzAwYTJkMzY5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Looking forward to it.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhNmVmYTg4MjRkYzRlZmFiZTg5NDc1MmI1NTUwMzZh"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Geovan hunter-turned-airship-captain quietly made her way to the kitchen, lost in her thoughts and operating purely on autopilot as she pulled out a skillet and the ingredients for a sweet and salty trail mix. Maeryn barely even registered cooking and delivering the final product to Frankie in a bowl. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZmJmYjMzZmU1ZDRkMzM5MjVmNjU0NzI3YmU5NDcw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Retreating to her room afterwards, Maeryn sat and pulled out her notebook. In the wake of all the excitement the previous night, she hadn’t entered a new log entry, and if she didn’t do it now she likely never would. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmNjM3MDA2NmY3OTRiYTY4OGJhZjhkZWZmOTU3Y2Qx"><span style="font-weight: 400">She wrote down everything. Their arrival on Airspire, Terrance’s departure, the mission to find Graves, Dan’s discovery of the Undead’s link to the Mist, and her decision to pursue inverted necromantic mana, to be dubbed “holy” mana. She logged her fears about being put to death or exiled for the necessary evil of learning necromancy. She even admitted how much she missed her parents. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkYTg5YjA2OTgwZjQ4ZDZiMWE1NjNjNDAyNGMzOGQ0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn’s pencil continued to scratch lightly against the paper as she wrote her longest log entry yet into what she now recognized as a journal of her adventure. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjMjY0NmUxYzU4NDQ3OTI5M2NlYTY3ZTNmYTE0ZjUw"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">But my parents aren’t here, and I have to make the best decisions I can. I guess we’ll find out whether they raised me to be as wise as them. </span></em></p>
<p class="cnM2MmJjZTVkZDM4MTQ5MDg4YTAyMTc1YWEyNjZhZTFl"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">We’re on the way to Mount Peace now</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">With any luck, Graves will still be alive and able to assist us with our plans going forward. Failing that, perhaps his assistant Ernesto might be of some help. I’m pretty sure that’s what Dan is checking right now while we fly. Dan always seems to be thinking a step or two ahead of me, but that’s why we work well together I guess.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnMwOTg4MTA5ZGMzNDRjMTc5YzllODk5NWFjY2UwMWRh"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">I sincerely hope that we won’t encounter any Undead at Mount Peace. But the Hunter’s Motto holds strong: preparation and clear thought are the keys to survival. It is time for me to sharpen my blades again for battle. </span></em></p>
<p class="cnNkZDMzMGQzNWQxNzQwYmVhYTI4ODY1NTVlNGEwNWI3"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Please, let them not be needed.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnMyM2UxNWI0MDJiMzQzOGY4YTcyNTMxNDg0YmQ4MmQw"><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, Maeryn closed her journal with a sigh. The act of recording everything had served to soothe her spirit and her mind, and she felt much more prepared for anything that may come. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjBhOWEzYjJhNDRlOTI5NTNiNDk5MGE4Y2M4M2Mz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Shrugging off her jacket and removing her vambraces, she disassembled her weapons and began her ritual of cleaning and testing them. They hadn’t seen any action at all since Maeryn had cleaned them before arriving at Airspire, but the simple acts of maintenance focused her. Soon, she was dressed once more, and equipped for battle should it come to that.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MDIzZjFjYTA3MzQxNmE5NDAzMTQ2NTJlMTBkM2Nm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn walked out of her bedroom as ready as she could make herself. The five hours were almost up, so she rejoined Frankie in the cockpit. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxYWE2MmFmNzMxMzQyMmRiNzVkMmE2ZmVlOWNhMTQ4"><span style="font-weight: 400">The pilot glanced at her and shook her head. “Depths beneath, intense much? You look like you’re about to go to war.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNjZiODk5YzMyNzQ1Yjc5OTcyM2IyZDc2ZDYyN2Nm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I hope not,” Maeryn said matter-of-factly, her eyes focused on the mountain range she could clearly see through the window. “But considering everything, I’m not about to rule out anything. Which one is Mount Peace?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzMWEzMDVkZWI1NjQ4NGM5ZjliMTA4ZjhkNDI5Njcw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hard to say. I’ve never been. Think it might be time to call Ernesto over,” Frankie admitted freely. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyYWZiODE5NmJkOTRlNjY4ZWE1MDM5Mjc2MzU2Mzhk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“On it.” Maeryn strode over the lab door and rapped sharply on it. “Need Ernesto, if you would.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlZDBmNmRkYmNhODRlODE5MTJlNWEwMzk2YjY2N2Rk"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a moment of silence before the door opened, revealing an anxious-looking Ernesto and a deeply pensive Dan as they walked out. “Ah, um, how can I be of assistance?” Ernesto asked. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDU4NmVmNjBiYzQ4NzhiNDYwYmVlOGFjNDQ5NWI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mountain identification. We’re in the right mountain range, and instead of flying slowly over a bunch of ‘em we’d like you to point us towards the right mountain.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTM0YjQxNTgzOTRlMGQ4YzFkN2FhY2JiYjgyYmQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, of course. Yes. I can do that.” The research assistant followed Maeryn, Dan trailing behind them both, back to the cockpit. Ernesto’s eyes rapidly darted around the window, settling on one in particular. “There! It’s that one, the third tallest mountain over there, with the slightly-flatter top. If your airship can hover, you can land there.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNmM2NWU2ZmM4YjQzZTE4NDQ2ZWQwMjEwMmQwOWI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Didn’t build her to hover,” Frankie said frankly. “What’s the other option?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1N2FkMmY1Y2FlZDQwYjE4YjIzNDJhZjc1MmFlYWFh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, um, if you circle around the peak, you should see, um, a runway near the bottom of the mountain? There should be a trail leading up Mount Peace.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiOTVlOGM1MGRiMzRhYmFhNzgyM2QwNzk5MDNlYzNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Frankie glanced at Maeryn, who gave her the nod. “Check it out.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNzVlYTIzZjA1NjRhYzU5MTcwMjkzNjIzNjY5MmY2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Got it, Captain.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmOTVmNmFhZWE3ZDQ5ZWViYjI3ZDg5NjdjNWE3MWUw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Stonewing</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">turned away from Mount Peace for a moment, then began making a wide circle to approach it from the other side. Sure enough… “Yep, there’s a runway,” Frankie reported. “And another airship. Looks small, though.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNjIxNmYxYWIzNzRkZDA5OTFkMWE3MTI2NjllYTk4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, yes! That should be Master Grave’s personal airship,” Ernesto explained. “He, um, he likes to be able to go where he wants.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjNGQzZjJkMjk0YTRhM2NiOWNlMmRlNGVlNThmZjQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn was more focused on what was on the mountain itself. Spaced throughout the mountain were several areas far flatter than what you could find in nature normally. There were simple iron fences around each of the areas, clearly marking them as man-modified structures, and a long, wide trail - at least wide enough for ten people walking side by side, from what Maeryn could see - cutting its way up the mountain to connect them all, switching back and forth until it reached the very top.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhM2Q1ZWFiZmRmMDRmMGU4OTUwNzE0YzkxZDEzMDAz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn narrowed her eyes, squinting as they approached, trying to make out the features on one of the closer flat areas. “Wait… are those… Ernesto, are those graveyards?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYzhlN2NjYmY5MjRhODFhMjM2M2M5OWI1MzFlM2Nl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto wrung his hands nervously. “Um… yes. Yes, they are. Mount Peace is named such because it is where we leave our honored dead to rest in peace. I’m… I’m surprised you didn’t realize, Captain?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3OTI3ZDlkMzM2MTQxZWFhYzc5ODMwNWY5ZGJhYWJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn didn’t answer him. This didn’t prove anything, she reminded herself. Research Master Graves was already known for running his experiments in graveyards. This was to be expected. But the sheer </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">quantity </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">of dead Zephyrians buried here… if a necromancer were to raise the dead here… </span></p>
