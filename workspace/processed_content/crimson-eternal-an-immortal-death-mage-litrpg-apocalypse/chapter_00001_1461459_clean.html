<u>
     Description:
    </u>
</strong>
   The World of Vortel is a world where one tenth of the population will be born with an ability. These ability users are classified in two different ways. Special Class Ability Holders, or SCAH, who have a unique ability that no one else has ever had before, and Regular Ability Holders, or RAH.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The abilities come in various different classifications:
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Physical: Physical Ability Holders gain an increase to their body in some physical manner such as superstrength or speed.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Magical: Magical Ability Holders gain the ability to use one magical element and gain a mana pool to go along with the element.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Special: Special Ability Holders are the in between. The abilities that cannot be classified in the other two classifications but are still abilities. These can include a hybrid of Physical and Magical, or neither. Some examples include the ability to use a single powerful attack, the ability to set yourself on fire but feel no pain and take no damage, or the ability to nullify abilities. But these abilities do not give the user any mana to use.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   There is only one continent on Vortel as all of the others have been destroyed over the years through war, leading to the Great Acclaims being established, banning the use of strategic abilities and strictly enforcing it within both nations to lock down any person with a strategic level ability and restrict the use of their ability.

<u>
     Description:
    </u>
</strong>
   The continent of Aran houses the Albarian and Arterian nations, both of whom have been at war for as long as either side can remember. The Albarians want the gold and metals that the Arterians have, and the Arterians want the fertile land that the Albarians have. And neither are willing to share with their eternal enemy.

     Description:

</strong>
   The System is an instinctive defense mechanism on every single planet in the universe, and it activates when invaders arrive to attack the planet.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<strong>
<u>
     Class:
    </u>
</strong>
   A Class is automatically assigned to every user based on their natural ability and talents. Leveling up their Class will give them skills that will benefit them in further accomplishing what their Class requires along with possible physical or magical enhancements to their own body.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<strong>
<u>
     Ability:
    </u>
</strong>
   An Ability is whatever ability the user was born with.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<strong>
<u>
     Level:
    </u>
</strong>
   A user’s level is increased by doing the action that their Class centers around.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Planets are tiered based on various factors including but not limited to the size of the planet’s population, the number of Ability Holders they have, and the power of the Ability Holders on the planet. And they are rated between Tiers Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Epsilon, with Alpha being the highest.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Abilities are divided into five Classes or Categories, the term varying depending on the culture classifying them.
