   Maeryn didn’t quite know what to make of Samuel Parlor. He was tall and reasonably good-looking, neither muscular nor noticeably overweight. His beard and hair - both kept short, mostly dark blond, with strands of white shooting through it, suggesting he was approaching middle age - were kept tidy to the point of immaculate. He dressed well, but not ostentatiously so, and despite his noble status, he kept a sword at his hip.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   If it weren’t for the sword, Maeryn would have been reasonably confident that he was a lower-class noble, or at least a noble who wasn’t so full of themselves that they needed to show it off. But something about the way he wore the sword, and moved with it… even though Samuel Parlor didn’t look terribly fit, he had experience with the blade. Maeryn would have bet on it.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Captain Maeryn. I assume all is well? Are all preparations made for the trip tomorrow?” Parlor asked, his tone calm and professional. The two of them were in a meeting room at the recruitment center, as Maeryn had learned was the custom when it came to the contracts in Airspire, and the hunter just couldn’t seem to get a read on him.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Yes, everything is fine. I’m simply here to finalize arrangements per our last discussion.” Maeryn tapped the paper in front of her. “We’ll be ready to leave first thing in the morning. I… do feel like I should remind you that the quarters we have are rather small, and that our airship isn’t designed for luxury or for, um, entertaining nobility,” she said hesitantly.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “It’s not a problem.” Parlor leaned forward, his expression unchanging. It was honestly somewhat intimidating. “As I’ve stated before, I’m more interested in getting to Zephyr than I am in being entertained along the way. Peace and quiet suits my purposes far more than watching hastily put together shows of drama and comedy.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn breathed in deeply and nodded. “Alright then. What time do you want to leave tomorrow?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “As early as possible. Will six work for you?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “We can make that work,” Maeryn agreed.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Then I believe our business is concluded. If there’s nothing else?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “There’s nothing, no.” They both stood, and shook hands. “I’ll see you tomorrow morning, then.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Until then.” Parlor gave a brusque nod and strode out without turning back.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn watched him go with a frown. “I just can’t get a read on him… why is he so intense?” she muttered, before shaking her head. “Not my business. It’s not your business, Rin, don’t obsess over it. After the month is over you’ll probably never see him again anyway.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   And yet, despite her words, Maeryn knew she’d be keeping a close eye on Samuel Parlor. Maybe it was just paranoia, but she had a feeling that the nobleman was involved in something more than a simple business deal, and she wanted nothing to do with it.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   On her way out of the recruitment center, Maeryn looked around for her captain acquaintance, Captain Jenkins of the airship Breegull, but the man was nowhere to be found. Maybe he’d gone to Cloudreach like she’d suggested, but Maeryn had kind of wanted to wish him farewell, especially since she was going to be gone for a few weeks.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Oh well. They’d meet again, Maeryn was certain of it.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   As it was the last time she’d step foot on Airspire for most of a month, Maeryn took the rest of the afternoon to explore and see the sights. As she passed by the Zephyrian Research Center, she allowed a rueful smile to cross her face. It had been almost two weeks since poor Jake at reception had told her his woes about the broken coffee machine, and Maeryn had bought him coffee from every coffee shop nearby to see if it would help the man cope.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Jake had appreciated the gesture, but there was apparently something magical in the coffee machine - beyond being powered by runes - that gave him the extra kick he needed to be properly functional. The worst of his caffeine withdrawal had passed, but the unlucky receptionist was still perpetually exhausted.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn eventually made her way back to the
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Dancing Dragonflies
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   inn, and she stood in front of it for a few minutes, contemplating. She hadn’t been on Airspire long, and yet… she’d gotten comfortable here. Unexpectedly so. Not quite as comfortable as home, but…
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn stilled. She hadn’t really thought about her home in Vert for… How long had it been? Days, certainly. Maybe a week? Guilt bubbled in her stomach, and she grimaced, sitting down at a nearby bench.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Were her parents okay? Surely by now they’d read her letter to them. What did they think of her? Did they approve of what she was doing? Had they, and Frankie’s mother, and Dan’s colleagues in the Alchemical Workshop, had any or all of them tried to convince the Elders to send people to retrieve them?
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   What if there were other Geovans in Cloudreach right now, looking for them?
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   What if there weren’t? What if they’d written off Maeryn and her crew? Did they think Maeryn and her friends were dead?
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn lowered her head, now wholeheartedly regretting that she hadn’t taken the time to speak to her parents before she left. Yes, maybe they could have somehow convinced her not to go on this crazy mission, but not knowing what they thought of her now… it hurt, in a way she couldn’t describe.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   She took a deep, shuddering breath, wrestling back control of her emotions. She’d see them again. Someday. And then she’d be able to tell them about her adventure, and all the crazy things that had happened, and even if they thought that she’d been rash or immature, Maeryn would be able to show them that she’d made a difference, and then they’d forgive her. Right?
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   … Right?
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn closed her eyes, trying not to acknowledge the wetness on her cheeks. She couldn’t go back. She’d made the best decisions she could. Her parents would understand that. They had to understand that. They’d raised her to be a problem-solver, and the Mist was a problem to be solved. She’d laid out all of her motivations and justifications in her letter to them.
  </span>
</p>
<span>

</span>
<p>
<span>
   She’d done the best she could. Hopefully her parents would see that, too.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   And if they couldn’t… then where the abyss were
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    they?
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   A flicker of anger ignited in her heart, roiling around the grief that threatened to seize her lungs, and yet the two emotions harmonized instead of quenching each other, leaving Maeryn feeling like she was holding a storm inside her chest.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn was sixteen years old! She shouldn’t, couldn’t have been the only one to notice the trends in the estimated timeline! They were running out of time, and nobody had been doing what had to be done! Even if Maeryn had been rash - and that was a big if, considering how long she’d been planning with Dan and Frankie - then it was only because of the failure of
  </span>
<strong>
<em>
    every adult who should have done this before she felt the need to!
   </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Because now… now she couldn’t go home.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn’s fists, which had unconsciously clenched, loosened abruptly as the storm of emotion broke, leaving nothing but wholehearted grief, and she buried her face into her hands as she choked out a sob. It felt like she had to literally drag it out of her chest, and even though she knew it wasn’t actually tearing little gashes along her throat as she did, it still left her aching and sore inside.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   She wanted to go home. She wanted her parents. But that wasn’t possible anymore.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn inhaled sharply, and wiped roughly at her cheeks. She couldn’t go back. She’d known that when she left. What was she doing? She was better than this. She was
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    better
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   than this. She couldn’t just sit around crying, when there were other things that she could be doing.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The more she was able to support her team, the faster they’d be able to solve the Mist problem, and the faster she’d be able to go back. She just had to focus on what she could do.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Just focus, Rin…” she muttered fiercely to herself. “Just. Focus.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   With her homesickness abated, though not fully dispelled, Maeryn was able to get to her feet and walk into the
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Dancing Dragonflies
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   inn. It was time to check on Dan and Ernesto’s progress.
  </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
   “Hey, Peter? Do you have a minute?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Peter looked up from the latest blueprints that he and Frankie had been working on together. “Sure, Frankie. What’s on your mind?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The girl seemed hesitant, almost nervous, which was an expression that he’d never seen on her face before. Peter’s heart thumped extra-hard. Was something wrong? He hadn’t done anything, had he? No, nothing came to mind…
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I, um… My Captain’s taken a contract. It’s going to take us out of Airspire for a few weeks,” Frankie explained quietly.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Oh.” Peter grimaced. That meant weeks without partnering with her. He didn’t know where Frankie had come from, but she was incredible, with ideas that he was sure he never would have thought of. Even better, she could follow him when his brain went all chaotic and jumped between seemingly unconnected ideas. He’d never found anyone who just “got” him so easily, like they were two winds dancing in canyons, and he wasn’t looking forward to having to adjust to working without her again. And he was sure that Chief was going to tease him more while she was gone, calling him “lovesick” or something. “Can I ask where you’re headed?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Zephyr.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Peter let out a low whistle. “The capital? Wow. I bet there’ll be tons of airship engineers over there.” He tried to sound nonchalant about it - jealousy wasn’t attractive, everyone always said. But some irrational part of his brain whispered that Frankie would think that the engineers over there were easier to work with, or more fun or something, and…
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Probably,” Frankie agreed, “but I wanted to ask something before we go.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   That stopped Peter’s self-deprecating spiral in its tracks. “Yeah?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Do… do you want to come with us?” Frankie asked quickly, almost stumbling over the words as they tried to escape. “It’s a small crew, I’m the engineer and pilot, and my Captain’s been looking for a second pilot, and I’m sure I could teach you
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    everything
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   about Stonewing
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    ,
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   and, and…” Her voice suddenly became very small, as Frankie looked down, visibly blushing as she fidgeted with her hands. “I’d like it if you came with us.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Peter blinked. It felt like his brain was stuttering. He understood each of the words that Frankie had just said, but it was like the total meaning just… escaped him. “You… want me… to join your crew? As second pilot?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “And second engineer,” Frankie confirmed, her voice just as quiet as before. “I, um… I know it’s really, really short notice. We leave tomorrow morning, and… and I would totally understand if you’re not sure or it’s just not enough time to think about it! I mean, you’ve got a good thing here, right?” Her voice was quickly reaching its normal decibels again as she rambled. “I mean, the stuff you do here is amazing and fun and amazingly fun and it’s not like I’m not going to come back! I’ll just be gone for a few weeks and then we can get right back where we left off, promise! Don’t worry about it. Ignore me! Let’s just get back to that blueprint and - !”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I’d love to go with you.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “ - see about improving that… wait. What’d you just say?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Peter took a deep breath. This was the most impulsive decision he’d ever made in his life, but… he was going to do it anyway. “I want to go with you. What do I need to do?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “You… you’re serious?” The smile growing on Frankie’s face was like the sun rising, and Peter felt his face flush. “That’s great! Yes!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “What’s this? Did someone finally work up the nerve to ask the other out?” Chief questioned with a teasing, knowing smile as he walked over from where he’d been helping other engineers.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Chief… she just invited me to be second pilot and second engineer on her Captain’s airship,” Peter breathed.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The man stopped in his tracks, blinking rapidly and mouth moving yet not making any sounds. “That’s… by the winds, that’s one storm of an offer. You’re serious, lass?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Frankie nodded firmly. “I’m my Captain’s primary engineer and pilot. I fixed up Stonewing
  </span>
<em>
<span>
</span>
</em>
<span>
   myself, and I know her inside and out. And Peter works really, really well with me. I think he could do it. And I think he could do it really well.” She frowned, looking a little remorseful. “I know that I’m basically poaching him from you. Sorry.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I mean, you’re not wrong, but… second pilot
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    and
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   second engineer?” Chief looked at Peter in amazement. “Lad, that’s not an offer that comes every day, even for a small airship. I know men half again my age that would slit throats for an opportunity like this. A position like that, with a halfway decent Captain, and you’re set for life. Assuming you can keep up with the work. What’re you thinking?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Peter swallowed heavily. “Yeah. I… I’m going to take it. I really do appreciate everything you’ve done for me, Chief, but…” He glanced out of the corner of his eye at Frankie. “I think this is the right decision for me.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I can’t blame ya.” Chief shook his head. “You two’re always welcome back here if you want to do more tinkering. So you better come back and let me know how you’re doing!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Yes, Chief!” Frankie and Peter agreed in sync.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Good! Now go see that Captain of yours so you can join the crew officially.” The two of them grinned at each other and ran off, and Chief shook his head ruefully. “Back in my day, you were supposed to be going steady for years
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    before
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   you moved in together in cramped spaces. Youth these days…”
