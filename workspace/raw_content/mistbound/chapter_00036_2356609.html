<p class="cnM3ODE2MGY2N2M5NTRjYTQ4ZTY5NWRiNGMwM2UyNmEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Early the next morning, Maeryn smirked as Frankie rushed past her to get to her place in the cockpit, unable to look her in the eye but nonetheless sporting a flustered blush. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4YzMyODhlNGQyYzQ1NDhhZmU2ZTgxNzY3OGJjNWNm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Frankie? Is something wrong?” Peter called out, hurrying to follow his fellow pilot. “Wait, why are you speeding up?!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYzE4OGJmNTAxMDRmNDI4ODFhMjYwMjEyNzg4MTE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No reason!” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhOTM5ODQ0OTUzMzQ2MGFiNGNhMzQ5NDcyNjNjNjIy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Beside Maeryn, Terrance let out a throaty chuckle, echoing her own well-deserved amusement. Frankie’s mortification the previous night had been everything Maeryn had hoped for. It served her right for putting her in that position to begin with. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyMWQ3MDJkYjEwMTRlMDlhNDJmYTMxOGQyM2FiN2Zj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Dare I ask what that was about?” Dan asked wryly, on his way up the ramp with Ernesto in tow. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiNmVmOGE2MGRkZjQ3MTFhYjNkMDk2NDI3NDY3ZmI0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Probably not,” Maeryn told him matter-of-factly. “She’s just embarrassed over a discussion we had last night. I’m sure she’ll get over it soon.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwMjcwNjU1MDgzNzQwNDBhODdjODEzMjIwMTUzM2Nj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan gave her a slow nod. “Right then. I’m sure it has absolutely nothing to do with the new member of the crew. The one that Frankie’s been spending a lot of time with.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMzE5YjkyNDRjNjQxYzM5N2FlNzNhMTNlM2VkMzUx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing at all.” Terrance wasn’t even trying to hide the lie in his words. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzZWI3MjcxYjkxYTQyODE4ZWRiZmE3MmIxYzBhMGQ0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan rolled his eyes. “Yep. You were right, Maeryn. I don’t dare ask. None of my business. Come on, Ernesto. I want to see how you’re doing with those Cold-aligned spells.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwZTBlNGE4ODAwMzQ2NmI4NmE5ZWFlNzQ0NzJlMjBm"><span style="font-weight: 400">The necromancer nodded. “O-okay!” </span></p>
<p class="cnMxNDdjZjc1YTY2YTRmMDFhZjFkODA0MjQ1ZDU4MzBk"><span style="font-weight: 400">The two slipped into Dan’s lab, leaving Maeryn and Terrance waiting for Samuel Parlor to arrive. It was only a few minutes until six o’clock, so he should be there any minute. “Get Stonewing</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">warmed up, Frankie!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYmMzZjA4M2RmOTQ2NGY5NDA4MmNjZGZiYzc5ZTMx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Already on it!” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwZmY1ZmM1ZjQxOTQ4MmRhOTg3MTI1YjYxN2Q0NTFh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Sure enough, Maeryn could feel the slight rumble in the airship as its systems came to life, steam flowing through the pipes permeating the flying machine. Now it was just a matter of - Maeryn cut off the thought, spotting the man approaching swiftly, carrying two suitcases, one in each hand. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1MzI5YWNmNWVlMTQ4NWU5MGM5MmRhYTIzZDdjOTk4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Captain Maeryn. Permission to board?” Parlor didn’t even sound winded, and Maeryn revised her estimations of the man’s strength. She also noted that he’d arrived right at six o’clock. Apparently the man was punctual to a point. She’d remember that.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZjk2ODM1NTBkZjQzYjBhNjc0NTI5Y2ZlZjg1NzM4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Permission granted. Welcome aboard, Samuel Parlor.” Maeryn stepped aside to allow him aboard, and without a word, Terrance made himself scarce, disappearing into his bedroom. As Parlor stepped aboard the airship, Maeryn swiftly guided him to the two remaining bedrooms that hadn’t been claimed by members of the crew. “There are two bedrooms available at this time, but it shouldn’t matter which one you pick. They’re identical.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM4MTUxNjAxMWMwZDQ3ZTBiYWE0YTJhODg4MGE1ODZl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then I shall take this one.” Parlor nodded in the direction of the door on the left, and Maeryn opened it for him, allowing the man to deposit his suitcases on the bed. The nobleman glanced around the room, obviously evaluating it, before nodding his approval. “This room will do splendidly. I assume all rooms lock from the inside?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZDlkNjA5ODJlYjRhMGI5ZDMwODE1NjYzZWVlMTJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“They do,” Maeryn confirmed. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTE2NzA3MzliZjRkYjBhMzFlOGNjNTViZDY2OGMz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Excellent. Are there any restrictions I should be aware of?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3YjM1MjNhMjJiMjQwZTNhMWY4NWU0YjRhOTBjZWIz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Only that the alchemist lab is off limits.” Maeryn pointed at the door to Dan’s lab. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0ODc5MTljYTY4ODRhMGZiYjJjMjdjYzUwNjMzOTI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Parlor blinked, a flicker of surprise breaking through his stoic features. “The… alchemist lab? That’s quite unusual, especially for a smaller craft such as this one.” He shook his head, and his expression returned to its normal composure. “I apologize, it’s none of my business. Rest assured I will stay far from it. Anything else?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5YzNmZmI0ZWU4YzQ1YjU4YjMxMjJkYWFiZmY3OGJk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing. I’ll make food periodically, or you have free reign of the kitchen if you wish to make something yourself.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0ODBmZmMwMjVlYzRmODJiYWQ4NWYyY2NiYmUyZWRi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Very well. If that’s all, then we should depart.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3OGJkMTZjY2ZhYTRiODJiYmJjMjMyNzQ0MjY3OWEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn nodded in agreement. “Frankie? Get us in the air. We’re headed to Zephyr.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlNTZhNGMyYTM2ZjQyZTVhMDAxZTQzMzAxZGY4MDA1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aye-aye, Captain!” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyYzE1YWI0YWMxNTQ1ZDJhNTJkNjU0ZjNiYThhNmJj"><span style="font-weight: 400">As the ship began moving, Maeryn looked at Parlor once more. “You’ll probably want to get comfortable. This will be a long flight.” </span></p>
<hr/>
<p class="cnMwNzI5ZTk4ODFhNTRlNzJhYTRlMzU4Y2RhYWFiOTI5"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">… and now we’re on our way to Zephyr. All estimates say that it should take about a week to get there. Why is it so far away? It makes no sense to me. All of Geova is reachable in a matter of a day at most using our train system, from one far-flung settlement to the opposite end. Yet the Zephyrians have flung themselves across the skies, far apart and isolated, even for those who have access to private airships. </span></em></p>
<p class="cnNmNzdiNmIyMzQ3YTQ2YjdiY2E2NTY1YWQwMWNlZTA3"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m sure the Zephyrians have their reasons. Maybe I should ask Terrance. The answer’s probably something like “making sure the flying cities don’t crash into each other” and “traveling the world’s air currents so they don’t take too much from any given region” or something like that. </span></em></p>
<p class="cnM4OWI3NzllYzI1ODRiZGM4MDYzNzVmYjMzODQxZjBk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn tapped her pencil against her journal pensively before continuing to write. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5N2U4YmY1ZDAxYjRiZWRiYjE2ZTk1NTQ5NTgwMzE0"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Samuel Parlor is not what he appears. I don’t know what he is, but there’s more to him than meets the eye. I hope that transporting him to and from Zephyr doesn’t get us caught up in anything strange. We’ve got too much on our plate as it is. I’ll be keeping a close eye on him. </span></em></p>
<p class="cnNmZTRjYmYyNjU3MjQ3MzJiNzUzOWI5NjE3NWViNWNh"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder if anyone will ever read this journal, someday. I know I’m writing it for my own benefit, but still, the idea that my thoughts might someday be read… it’s kind of comforting. Like, no matter what happens, there’s evidence of my journey. Of our efforts. We exist, and we’re doing our best. I can only hope our best is good enough. </span></em></p>
<p class="cnM2MGNjM2Y1NGY2YjRmZGZhY2VlMzlkYTI4ZjIyNWEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn set down her pencil and closed her journal with a sigh. Now that she’d completed her log, she had officially exhausted everything on her to-do list for the next few hours. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4OTZhODljNTU2YTQ1YWVhYWUzNDU1MmU2MDFmMmY4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Which left… Maeryn turned to look to the side of her bed, where she’d placed the guitar case, anxiety and trepidation washing over her. She took a deep breath and tried to swallow her nerves; she wasn’t doing anything wrong. She wasn’t committing to anything. This was just something to pass the time, and if she didn’t like it, she didn’t have to continue. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzY1NmI1ZDNkMjQ4ZTM4NmU3MWNlODg5ZTI3M2Jm"><span style="font-weight: 400">And it wasn’t as though anyone was going to hear her, even if she turned out to be absolutely terrible at it. Right? Right. Maeryn had seen in the shop that she could play quietly. She could do this, and not feel completely foolish. </span></p><span class="cjYyOGUxN2I4MDc1ZDRlYjk4YzJjNjk1YzcxZmY1YTdm"><br/>This tale has been unlawfully lifted from Royal Road; report any instances of this story if found elsewhere.<br/></span>
<p class="cnMxYzQ1ZjA2NmNkMzQ5ZmFiNjE0OTgwNDZmZTE2MWVm"><span style="font-weight: 400">She just… Maeryn bit her lip. Why was she so anxious about this? She’d done so many scary, scary things, some with incredibly real, tangible, life-threatening risk behind them. She’d spent years as a hunter fighting Mistwarped beasts, and she’d gone toe to toe with two Undead so far. She’d faced death time and again. So why were her hands shaking at the idea of doing this? </span></p>
<p class="cnNkMjk1MzVhYzIyNjRkNjY4N2Q1YzJmNGE2OTQ5MmVm"><span style="font-weight: 400">She sat back and thought about it. Maybe it was because making music wasn’t a life-and-death struggle. Maeryn had never really had any real hobbies, unless you counted spying on the Elders and tinkering with her vambraces and oven. Maybe it was that she just didn’t have anything to relate it to. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjYTQ1YzY5NzRjNDQ4YjZiYzg0ZDBkZjc0NmUzNGQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Was she just afraid of being bad at playing the guitar? Sort of, but not really. Maeryn knew full well that she - being a rank amateur - would be awful to start with. Everyone was when they tried something new. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4Y2I1NjJlZmQ3ZDQ3OWI4MWY3YmI4OTE0NTA4ZjRj"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was more that she didn’t want to be </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">seen </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">or </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">heard</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> being awful at it. But even that wasn’t the whole story. What was it…? </span></p>
<p class="cnM2MTIyMmVhOGJmMzQ0MTY4ZjkxYmEzZTI3YWQ5Yzgy"><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, Maeryn sighed and gave up. She couldn’t quite put her finger on what was bothering her so much about it, but she’d never been one to let fear keep her down. Besides, Terrance would be incredibly disappointed if she never even tried, considering it’d been a gift. She took a deep breath to steady herself, and reached for the guitar case. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0OTZlY2EyZjA1MTRkZjg5MjdkNWE4OTgzNmEwODU0"><span style="font-weight: 400">The clasps made a soft click as she opened the case, the scent of polished wood wafting up as she lifted the lid. Lying atop her instrument was a thick folder containing sheet music and a guide to reading it. “Oh. Yeah. Can’t play the sheet music if I can’t read it. I guess that would be a necessary first step, wouldn’t it?” Maeryn muttered to herself, simultaneously disappointed and relieved that she wouldn’t be touching her guitar just yet. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwOTU1MjZmMDk1MTQ5ZmJiMTA2NjE3MTI3ODYwMTA1"><span style="font-weight: 400">The guide wasn’t that long - just an explanation about how the sheets marked different durations of notes, the scales, and what a few other markings meant - such as repeating sections, and parts where she was supposed to play more loudly or more quietly. Maeryn did her best to memorize it, glancing over to refer to one of the sample bits of sheet music as she did so. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxYTliMzI4NDI3YjRkMjlhNTFlNmQwYTVjYzRkYTRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">It didn’t look too complicated, even if she didn’t yet understand how the six strings on her guitar were supposed to create dozens of different notes. Elton was sure to have included some kind of explanation somewhere in his starter pack, she was sure. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiNGZjYjQ1MmQ2MjRjMzlhYmMyMTk0MGIxY2UzNzdh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, after having read everything there was to read, Maeryn had no further excuses. She picked the simplest of the sheet music that Elton had provided - a single page, a simple tune, obviously provided to introduce a beginner to their instrument - and set it where she could read it. Then she hefted the guitar onto her lap, carefully placed her hands, and took a deep breath. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0N2NkZmU0MWI3ZjQ2YjBhZDg3ZGI3MmU3Y2ZiN2I1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here we go…” Scrutinizing the sheet, she reached for the corresponding string for the first note, and flicked it softly. The sound came out as quietly as she wanted, and Maeryn tried not to sigh in relief as she received more confirmation that she wouldn’t be having her first attempts overheard. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxNGRhMDEyMTkwMzRmMzZiY2I3MTAzMjFlZmU0M2I3"><span style="font-weight: 400">She shook her head and tried again, repositioning her fingers. “Okay, Maeryn. You don’t have to get the whole thing at once. Start small. Once you have the first part, then you can move on. Just do… four notes. That’s not so bad.” She looked at the sheet, identifying the first four notes of the tune as she muttered. “First this string… then this one… then this one twice… Okay. Okay. I can do this. It’s just four notes.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjYTgyMjliZjU3NTQ0ZDI4YTA4YjkwNmYwYTc1NWYz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her first attempt was halting, and didn’t keep to any kind of rhythm, and Maeryn’s cheeks burned even as she rapidly glanced at her closed - and locked - door to make sure no one witnessed her utter failure. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1ODJiMzAzMDhiMzQzMTI5ZDViMDgyZDc3YTQ0OGIx"><span style="font-weight: 400">She closed her eyes and breathed in, trying to quash her embarrassment. “Just try again,” she told herself. “It’s like… trying to wield a new weapon. Or learn a new spell. Don’t beat yourself up, just try again.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjMmI0YjRiYzNiMzQyNjQ4ZDU0YzY5ZmU0N2QxMDgw"><span style="font-weight: 400">And that was how she spent the next couple of hours - slowly working her way through the simple tune. It didn’t take long for her to get through the first four notes, but moving to the next four was difficult - Maeryn struggled to keep track of which string was supposed to be next, and several times she cringed as she accidentally played a jarring note and ruined the melody. She was slowly starting to get a feel for keeping rhythm, though, which made her feel better. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5MWJjYTI5YjhlOTQ2ZWM5NDdlMmFhNWQwNzhkM2M4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, though, she realized that she wasn’t supposed to memorize the string order. Maeryn just… needed to internalize which note meant which string, and read the sheet music as she played. She sighed - this was going to take a while. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5NDU1ZDgyOGY5MTQyODBiYzU2YzhmNjRiNGZhZTlj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, she had to stop - her fingers were starting to ache. Maeryn inspected the tips of her fingers curiously, and grimaced when she realized that the strings had started to dig into her skin from the action of plucking the strings. Somehow, seeing the impact for herself seemed to make something click in her brain, and she was suddenly fully aware of just how much her fingers stung. Maeryn winced. “Guess I’m done for the day. Ow. How long does it take to grow calluses on your fingers?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyZmE3NjA5MGRkZDQ2NzQ4ZjFmYjhjNGVlNjY4ZDcz"><span style="font-weight: 400">She slowly put everything away, but she did so with a vaguely satisfied feeling in her chest. She hadn’t made it through the whole song, but by the time she’d been forced to stop, Maeryn had reached more than two-thirds of it. The tune wasn’t that complicated, and it had repeating sections that let her take advantage of her growing skill in the earlier parts. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzZjViMDZhNDMwYzQ0NDNhOWJmNmZiMWVkMTFlOGI0"><span style="font-weight: 400">It still wasn’t </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">smooth</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, but she’d at least been able to recognize it as music. So… progress. It felt good. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2MmZmY2VlZDA3NDQ2M2JiYTYyODkyYzIzNzQwY2U4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ow…!” Though her fingers clearly disagreed, as the sting grew into actual pain. “Okay. Clearly, that was too long a session. Got it, lesson learned, keep it shorter. Ow…!” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwMmI4N2RhMmIxZTQ0YzE4YTJmOWI1MjQ2MzEwMjM5"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was at that moment that she realized: she wouldn’t be able to keep going after lunch. She needed to give her fingers time to heal. Which meant… “Depths and damnation! I don’t have anything to do this afternoon!”  </span></p>
<p class="cnNmODk4OTY2YWQ1MzQwNDg4MTA0NDBkZDUzOWU1YjI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn groaned and flopped back onto her bed, staring up at the ceiling. “What do normal people do with their free time? They can’t all be studying magical theory or tinkering with steam engines.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNDcyODc2MjM1MTRlZTJhOGI1MTZjNWVhNDgxZGJk"><span style="font-weight: 400">For a brief moment, she considered seeing if Ernesto would be amenable to teaching her that </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vitality Boost </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">spell of his, the necromantic spell that enhanced digestion to create a short burst of energy and stamina. Then Maeryn shook her head; with Parlor on board, it wasn’t worth the risk. With their luck, Parlor would be reasonably sensitive to mana and somehow figure out something wasn’t right. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0YzAwYjYyZDk0MTQ0NTE4YmJiMzZmMmUwMzg2YWZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, it wasn’t as though she was permitted in Dan’s alchemy lab, and that’s where the two of them were anyway. Then again, she </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">had </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">been wanting to learn how to use runes to recreate the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Fireball </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">spell on her vambraces, for mana efficiency… </span></p>
<p class="cnMwNWY4ZmM3Y2VjNDRmMDdhYTMyZmZmNmZjNTdjMDE3"><span style="font-weight: 400">With a sigh, she resigned herself and left her room. After a moment, she knocked on the door to the lab. “Hey Dan? Any chance you have any books on runes or mana inversion? I want to get some studying in.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMxZWNlN2QwYzAwNTQ2Y2M5YjlhYjc3MTdmOTk1ZWZm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just a minute…!” Dan replied, his voice slightly muffled but still clearly understandable. Maeryn waited patiently, and two minutes later the door opened just enough for Dan to give her a surprisingly heavy stack of books. “There you go. Some light reading.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM4NzY5MWZjZGUyZTQyY2I5ZWY2MjBiMjUxMTIxYTU4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You call this light…?” Maeryn protested weakly. But Dan didn’t hear it; he’d already closed the door and was back to doing whatever he was doing with Ernesto in there. Maeryn glanced down at the armful of books she was now carrying and sighed. “I guess compared to how much he has to go through, this would be considered light, huh.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNkNWRkNDAyNDYzYzQ3MWViNjliMzY2YTQ4MjMxNTU4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Defeated, she sat down at the table in the central area and spread the books out before her. Examining the titles, she discovered </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Encyclopedia of Runes, 8th Edition</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">An Apprentice’s Guide to Runic Sequences</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> and its two sequels, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">A Journeyman’s Guide</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">An Expert’s Guide</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Elemental Enchantment, 3rd Edition… </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">and finally, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">So You Want to Learn a New Magic Element</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDM5NTJmMjQ0MzRiY2M4MGU5NDllZWY3MmIyNWEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn sighed. Maybe she’d be able to work out that </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Fireball </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">spell as an enchantment after all. But she was very much not looking forward to how much reading she’d have to do. Oh well. It had to be better than just lying bored on her bed all day, right? </span></p>
<p class="cnMxNWMyMTMwNzNlNjQ2MTk4Y2U5M2NlYjE1ODdiOTdi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I better not get a papercut on what the strings did to my fingers,” she muttered mutinously as she pulled </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">An Apprentice’s Guide to Runic Sequences </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">closer to herself and opened it to the first page. </span></p>
