   Frankie was dozing in her room, catching up on lost sleep when the knock on her door abruptly woke her. Stretching, she opened the door to see what was going on, only to see Maeryn and Dan looking… stretched thin was probably the best description. Frankie wasn’t the best at reading body language, but everything about Maeryn’s posture screamed exhaustion, and Dan’s face was slack and his vision set in the far distance. “Guys? What’s wrong?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Graves is dead. Ernesto’s joining the crew. He’s burying his Master now, and should be joining us in a couple of hours. Dan was right; the Undead are making the Mist. I saw it firsthand.” Maeryn body stilled for a long, too-long moment, and Frankie could feel her blood pressure spike with worry. “I fought one.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Frankie gasped, then rapidly inspected Maeryn for injuries, jumping into her personal space and raising one arm and then the other. She saw no rips, no tears, no blood stains, just a couple of dirt stains. “You’re not hurt?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “No… it tried, but I was able to kill it. It was only able to knock me down once before I got the better of it.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Good! Good.” Frankie breathed a sigh of relief. “Wait, you said Graves is dead? That’s decidedly not good. And why is Ernesto joining the team?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Dan opened his mouth, then, his eyes still not focusing on her properly, which was very, very concerning. Dan had always given her his full attention when talking to her before. “Graves was a necromancer, and he turned himself into a ghost when the Undead killed him. An actual ghost. Maybe a wraith? His touch did leave frost behind.” He slowly shook his head, his eyes unblinking. “I followed a ghost into its home and talked to it without ever knowing. I… I need to go lay down.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Go,” Maeryn ordered tiredly. Dan’s mouth clicked shut, and he nodded, walking slowly over to his room. He clutched the doorknob tightly for a moment and took another deep breath before stepping in and closing the door behind him.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Frankie stared at them both. “Um… a ghost? And what does this have to do with Ernesto?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Yeah. That happened. Graves’ ghost sent me to kill the Undead who killed him. I found his corpse. Real life ghost story. Ernesto is Graves’ disciple, and will be filling the role of token necromancer in our crew. It’s… it’s been a rough day, Frankie.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I can tell.” Frankie couldn’t help but feel out of her depth. Undead? Ghosts? That wasn’t something you could fix with gears and grease. At least… she thought so? Were ghosts weak to steam? If they were she could maybe come up with some kind of steam blaster. The biggest problem would be carrying the necessary water… Gah! Focus, Frankie! “Um… are we haunted now, then? Is Graves going to be following us or something?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   A bubble of somewhat-manic laughter emerged from Maeryn’s throat, which only left Frankie more unsettled. She’d never heard
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    that
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   laugh from her friend in the past, and she really could have gone the rest of her life without wondering if Maeryn’s sanity had cracked. Not that Frankie would blame her after the explanation she was getting. “No…! No. His ghost faded away. We’re not haunted. I think. Although who knows when that’ll change? Necromancy is weird.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Well, at least there’s that.” Frankie sighed. What did normal people need after a hard day again? Frankie preferred to go tinker, but that wasn’t exactly Maeryn’s thing. Oh, right! Sleep! And showers! She didn’t really get why some people liked those so much, but maybe it’d help? “You should probably go lie down too, Rin. Get your head on straight. You said necro-boy is going to be a couple of hours? Go take a shower or something.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn gave her a wan smile. Well, at least it wasn’t another manic laugh. Frankie let that thought settle, a tiny box of
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Progress
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   tucked away in her mental filing cabinet. Small victories counted. “Yeah. Yeah, okay. If I’m not back out here by the time Ernesto gets back, just take us back to Airspire, okay?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Ah, clear instructions, something she could latch onto. Ambiguity was the enemy, but a plan? Not just that, but a plan that everyone agreed on? That was something she could work with. Frankie let out a tiny exhale, feeling the tension in the room lessen, as if it had hissed out of a pressure valve, and her own pulse settled into its typical calm confidence. “Can do,” she told Maeryn with a cheerful smile.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn didn’t quite manage to return it, but Frankie could tell that she tried. She watched as her captain retreated to her room; Maeryn would feel much better after a nap. Probably. In the meantime, though… “So… huh. Ernesto’s a rookie necromancer. At least none of us gotta learn that… probably, anyway. I’m sure Dan’ll be happy about that when he stops focusing on the ghost thing.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Privately, though, she was extremely glad she didn’t go with Maeryn and the others. She
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    hated
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   ghost stories, and Frankie was self-aware enough to know that she probably would have run screaming the moment it became clear that Graves was a ghost. “Wait. If Graves is dead… then his airship is up for grabs, right?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   She waited for a long moment, then shrugged to herself, ducking back into her room for a few seconds before reemerging with her toolbag. “Time to go a-scavenging.”
  </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
   A shower was
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    exactly
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   what Maeryn had needed, she decided as she got out and dried herself off. She felt much more human than before. “Maybe some of that smelly Undead black gunk was messing with my head or something. I’m just glad that’s over. For now at least.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   With her head clear, Maeryn sighed and sat on her bed, not bothering to redress just yet. She… probably hadn’t made the best of impressions on Ernesto, had she? Like, she didn’t exactly
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    regret
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   the way she’d confronted Graves, and she truly had been at the edge of her rope, but she hadn’t just ripped the bandage off for Ernesto - she’d dunked the wound in salt water and aggressively rubbed it in. There had to have been kinder ways to go about the Undead battle aftermath.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn rubbed her temples, feeling like she should have a headache even if it wasn’t presently there. Which had a pain of its own, weirdly. “I should apologize when he gets back. Once I figure out how to say ‘Sorry for being a rust-tongued flintface when you were just learning that your Master died.’ Ugh.” She kneaded her fists into her eyes, wishing that she’d had just a little bit more compassion back then. Now she was going to have to try to work past
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    that
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   terrible impression.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   With a deep sigh, Maeryn picked up her notebook flipped to her latest entry, then began to write.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
    Update, Same Day:
   </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
    If I tell a ghost story ever again, Mount Peace will be the setting. There are graveyards spaced up the mountain, there’s literally no life anywhere besides grass and trees, and best of all, I have a ghost story that’s actually true. Not that anyone will ever believe me.
   </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn briefly retold the story about encountering Graves, the fight with the Undead, and the revelation that Graves was a ghost before continuing on with her thoughts.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
    As for Ernesto himself… well, he’s joining the crew, at his ghost master’s behest. He’s understandably grieving, and I don’t have any good ideas on how to handle that. I mean, grief is something you’re not supposed to rush, but we do have a time limit to, you know, get a solution for the Mist before Critical Mana Depletion and/or Zephyria has to start landing its flying cities in Geovan farmland. I think he’ll be able to pull himself together, but I don’t know what approach to take to help him do it faster. Should I just give it to him straight, tell him that we don’t have time for him to grieve properly, and that he needs to go to work immediately? Should I try to give him a few days, a week, to get it out of his system and see if he is able to get himself on track? Should I leave it to Dan?
   </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
    Probably not that last one. I’m pretty sure Dan’s established worldview may have been shattered by the existence of ghosts. He wasn’t really responsive at all on the way down the mountain. I hope that he’ll be able to work well with Ernesto - I need them to work together to create holy magic. I mean, maybe Ernesto will surprise us, but I get the impression that he’s a lot newer to magic than Dan is, and inverting a mana element is a lot of work.
   </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
    We’ll be heading back to Airspire as soon as Ernesto joins us from burying his Master. But, at least we’re making progress. We have a clear set of steps to take: help Ernesto train in necromancy, help Dan and Ernesto learn to invert necromantic mana, take the resulting “holy” mana and create a purification spell, and test it on the Mist. If it works, then we take the result to the Alchemical Workshop and start mass-producing stuff with runes inscribed to purify the Mist.
   </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
    Simple enough, I hope. We’ve still got several months, presumably, so… at this point all I can do is support Dan and Ernesto.
   </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
    For now, it looks like home base will be on Airspire. Guess we’ll see how it goes.
   </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn closed her notebook with a sigh, then reluctantly got up and dressed, electing to wear her Geovan outfit. Her Zephyrian captain outfit needed a good washing - she could still smell faint whiffs of the Undead’s malodorous gunk, even if none of it had touched her.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   A rumbling from her stomach reminded her that she hadn’t eaten in several hours, and that decided her next move for her. Exiting her bedroom, she stalked straight over to the kitchen, making a hearty meal with enough servings for everyone. Then she made a bit extra, because she felt ravenous after not having eaten much for lunch and then having a fight for her life, and fresh hot food sounded damned amazing. And then a bit more, because she had no idea what Ernesto’s appetite might look like, and she refused to double-down on being a terrible leader to him first thing.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn had just finished setting up plates at the table and was about to call out to Dan and Frankie when a familiar set of shuffling footsteps caught her ear. She looked up and saw the newest member of her crew just as he entered the airship. “Welcome back, Ernesto. I just finished making dinner… I thought you might be hungry when you got back. Do you want to wash up to eat? I think we could all use a warm meal after today. If you’re not up to it, it’s okay if you want to eat privately in your room.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I…” Ernesto swallowed heavily, before a bittersweet smile crossed his face. “Actually, if you’re okay with it… I don’t want to be alone right now.”
  </span>
</p>

</span>
<p>
<span>
   “Alright. Give me just a minute to get the others, and we can sit down and eat. Go wash up in your bathroom, okay?” Maeryn did her best to give him a warm smile.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Y-yes, Captain.” Ernesto hurried off to his bedroom, and Maeryn’s smile faltered. Ernesto was still intimidated by her, it seemed. Hardly surprising, but she’d hoped to maybe bridge some of that distance with a meal. Oh well, maybe she’d have more luck as they ate.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   With a sigh, Maeryn walked over and rapped sharply on Dan’s door. “Hey Dan! I know for a fact you haven’t eaten today, and I’ve got food hot off the stove! Come eat something!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Alright, alright, I’m coming, Maeryn! Don’t break down my door!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeyrn’s lips twitched, reminded against her will about the one time she
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    had
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   damaged Dan’s door back in Greenstone. Dan had been ill enough not to go into work at the Alchemical Workshop, and fourteen-year-old Maeryn had - with her mother’s help - made a big pot of stew to help him keep his strength up. Dan had locked his door and been passed out in his bed, but Maeryn hadn’t known that and thought that Dan’s door was just stuck. She’d muscled her way through, carrying the pot of stew the whole way, then woken her friend and forced him to eat.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The event had become a recurring joke between them ever since. The fact that Dan was calling back to it now was a good sign, in Maeryn’s opinion.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Sure enough, Dan opened the door half a minute later, looking much recovered from his supernatural experience. “Food’s on the table,” Maeryn informed him with a smirk. “Your door is safe for today.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “My door thanks you for your benevolence,” Dan snarked, trying and failing to hide a grin. “So does my stomach, by the way. That smells delicious.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Good! Go eat! I need to fetch Frankie, wherever she is.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I’m right here!” Frankie called out, almost skipping into the ship. “I could smell your cooking from Graves’ old airship, and let me tell you, my tongue and stomach nearly held a mutiny when I decided to finish putting my tools away first!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Seeing the soot and oil on Frankie’s arms and hands, Maeryn pointed at Frankie’s room imperiously. “Wash up first!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “But you’ll eat it all…!” Frankie whined.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I made extra,” Maeryn replied, refusing to budge. “Go now, and it’ll still be hot when you’re done.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Fiiiiine,” Frankie acquiesced, dashing to her bedroom.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   It was only a few short minutes before all four of them were seated at the table and digging in. The hot meal did a lot to drive any remaining supernatural chill out of their thoughts, and even though few words were spoken, Maeryn was more than satisfied when Ernesto asked for seconds without stuttering at all.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Finally, all the food was eaten, and Maeryn patted her stomach contentedly. They’d somehow finished the whole thing, even the extra she’d made, and she mentally patted herself on the back for her forethought. She might regret how much she ate later, though, but that was a problem for future-Maeryn. “Ah. Now that we’ve all eaten, does anyone have anything they want to bring up before we start flying back to Airspire?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Frankie immediately raised a hand. “I want more meals like this! It’s been, like, a week since we were able to sit down and eat together in private, and snacking while flying just isn’t the same.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Dan nodded a quiet agreement. Ernesto said nothing, looking a little awkward, but when Maeryn looked at him, he blushed and gave a tiny nod as well.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I’ll do my best to make time,” Maeryn promised. “I know we’ve been busy, what with flying to Cloudreach, then all the shenanigans with the research and the Council of Winds, and then flying to Airspire, and then today’s mission. I can’t promise we’ll be able to do stuff nightly, but I’ll try to make it happen more often.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Works for me!” Frankie chirped. “Best pirate captain ever!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn glared at her witheringly.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Um, pirate captain?” Ernesto asked, clearly confused. “You’re pirates?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “We are not/We are!” Maeryn and Frankie replied simultaneously.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn’s stare grew murderous. “You just want me to wear the hat again.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Frankie just looked smugly at her, and Maeryn harrumphed, stomping over to her quarters and coming out with the ridiculous tricorn hat. She returned to her chair and looked at Ernesto with a sigh. “We’re not pirates. It’s an inside joke. Frankie will explain it later. Just… ignore the hat?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Why would I ignore it?” Ernesto asked, genuinely confused. “It’s a badge of honor. Part of the captain’s uniform. Makes you look more Captain-y.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn groaned. “Just… please?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “If that’s what you want,” Ernesto agreed, sounding just as bewildered but accepting her wishes. “But, um, I’d like to know more about the stuff you just mentioned? The research shenanigans, the Council of Winds, all of that? Master wanted me to join your crew, so I feel like I should know more about it?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Well, I’ll give you the long story later,” Dan began, “but the short form is that we’re Geovans. We repaired and stole this airship, flew to Cloudreach, met a rogue named Terrance, then stole their mana and Mist research. The Council of Winds arrested Frankie, and tried to arrest Maeryn. Maeryn overpowered the guards, then we saved Cloudreach from a flock of Mistwarped Rocs. Then we negotiated with the Council, all charges were dropped, and we flew to Airspire with Terrance. Terrance vanished, I discovered the same thing your Master did about the link between Undead and the Mist, and Maeryn coincidentally found your request. And then today happened.” Dan shrugged. “Any questions?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Um…” Ernesto blinked. “I have a lot of questions, yes. And concerns about your methods? But mostly questions. I think I understand why Frankie called you a pirate now, though.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn took off her hat, lowered her head to the table, and groaned long and hard, trying to ignore Frankie’s cackles.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Ernesto looked at her sympathetically before continuing. “The most pressing one, though, I think, is what we’re doing next? Master seemed to think you were trying to deal with the Mist?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Dan opened his mouth, but Maeryn beat him to it. “I’ll field this one,” she said, raising her head, and Dan nodded in acquiescence. She turned to Ernesto. “We
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    are
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   trying to deal with the Mist,” she confirmed, before outlining the plan to invert necromantic mana and create a purification spell. “Problem is, necromancy is super-forbidden in Geova. Death penalty forbidden, with really good reason. I still think Dan could learn it, but he’s understandably skittish.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Dan made a face, but didn’t interrupt.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Which brings us to you,” Maeryn continued after a beat. “Your Master was a necromancer. He’s passed his Compendium to you. And it sounds like he was raising you to be his successor. So… how much experience do you have with necromancy?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Ernesto looked down, mumbling something.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Sorry, didn’t catch that.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The young man swallowed and spoke a little louder. “Only a little. Master taught me a couple of spells for self-defense, but he was more focused on communicating with the dead instead of raising them. I’ve, um, never made an Undead, if that’s what you’re asking.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Dan’s eyes went wide. “There are uses of necromantic mana that don’t involve making Undead?” he demanded.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Ernesto’s eyes lit up. “Several!” he agreed eagerly, all uncertainty gone in the face of his favorite subject. “Necromantic mana is adjacent to ice mana, so Master made sure I could cast
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Chilling Touch
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   to defend myself without giving anything away. But did you know that you can make cheese out of milk using necromantic mana? I mean, cheese is just the product of milk fermenting and rotting in a certain way, and rotting is what necromantic mana does best.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “That’s fascinating!” Dan enthused, his fingers visibly twitching for a pen to write down Ernesto’s words. “What else?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Well, the other trick that Master made sure I could do was a spell he called
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Vitality Boost
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   . If you twist the necromantic mana in the right way, you can accelerate your body’s digestion and processing of food, giving the target - namely, me - a faster stamina and strength recovery! Apparently digestion is close enough ideologically to the concept of rot that necromantic mana works well with it. Or maybe it has something to do with stomach acid? It might be both, now that I think about it… I, um, I had to use it a few times while we were hiking up the mountain,” he admitted.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn groaned with envy. “I would have
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    killed
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   for that spell when I was training to be a hunter…! None of you have any idea how often I felt like I was gonna die from not being able to catch my breath, or how much it freaking hurts the next day when the hunters put you through a full body workout!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Ernesto smiled at her brightly. “I’d be happy to teach you when we have time!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “You know, I might just take you up on that. I’ll just have to be careful not to use it when we get back to Geova.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “There are other applications, too!” Ernesto continued, obviously ecstatic at the acceptance of his new crew. “Like, information gathering, and tracking! Master was going to teach me a spell to communicate with willing spirits soon, and well, it’s hard to keep secrets from the dead. He said that one’s a bit dangerous, though, since not all spirits are benign… Master wanted me to have a spell that could repel ghosts first. I’m sure it’s in the Compendium somewhere.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Well then!” Maeryn said with a clap of her hands, feeling much more enthusiastic about their chances. “That’s perfect! You’re already familiar with necromantic mana, there are things you can practice without raising the dead, so all we need to do is…!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Wait a minute, Maeryn,” Dan interrupted, suddenly serious. “In order to invert any kind of mana type, you have to be reasonably experienced with
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    all
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   of its basic concepts. For example, if you want to invert fire mana, you need to see, experience, and understand how it consumes what it burns, how fire destroys what it cannot consume, the nature of heat transfer, how fire is used for light, and flame’s usages to purify and sterilize equipment.
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Burning, Destruction, Heat, Light, Purification.
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   ” Dan emphasized those last words, clearly identifying the core concepts of fire-element mana. “If your understanding of any of the concepts is insufficient, or flawed, then the inverted mana will be unstable, volatile, and easily destroyed. If I tried to make a
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Fire Resistance
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   enchantment without a proper understanding of
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Purification
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   , for example, then the enchantment could and likely would be worn away by a real fire as it ‘purified’ the item I enchanted.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Seeing the understanding in his companions’ eyes, the alchemist continued. “In this case, it sounds like necromantic mana has at least five concepts:
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Rot, Cold, Acid
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   - unless
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Acid
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   is just bundled under
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Rot
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   , but better to be good at that anyway just in case -
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Spirit Communication
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   , and
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Undead
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   . I’m sure we’ll have to refine that list as we go, but that’s where we’re starting. It sounds like Ernesto’s got a beginner’s handle on
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Rot
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   and
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Cold
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   , and maybe
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Acid
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   , but the other two…” Dan shook his head. “We can practice communication with spirits discreetly, probably, but at some point he
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    will
   </span>
