<p class="cnMyZWQ0Y2IzMmNhMzQwNzRhOTc4Mzk4YWMzYzkzZjg3"><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned back to Ayumi for a clue on what to do next. To my surprise, her expression was calm. It wasn’t because of the overwhelming, impulsive curiosity that often stopped her from acting. She seemed uncharacteristically deep in thought.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NWNhNWQyNjJkYTQ2YmRiMTEyNDdiNjViNTE2ZDE3"><span style="font-weight: 400">A dark shadow loomed over her. I knew that this conversation had revealed some disturbing pieces of information, but I had a feeling that wasn’t the reason for her woes.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YzI3MTQ5YjMwMjQ3YjRhNmE0Mzc3MmFkOTIwY2Rm"><span style="font-weight: 400">I shook her shoulder to grab her attention. It took her a few moments to notice.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0M2JhOTEzOTljZTQ2NzU5YzQ2ZjMyYmY5ODIxZGIz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, Takkun. Sorry, I was just thinking about something.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYWY2NjE4NmE1NTRkNDk4OGQ3MTllZTQxYWVkMTA4"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, I noticed. Ayumi, it’s getting quite late. What do you want to do? Call it quits?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNGI4MDY1YTlkYzQ1ZjViYmUzZGVlZDIwY2Y5MGVm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, yeah. You’re right,” she said while looking around, almost as if she just now realized what time it was.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDFkZDkyMGY0ZDQ1NDY4ZTk3MTFmZjc1NDUyMWEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">She still seemed quite out of it, even more due to her vague reply. I decided it was about time I got to the bottom of this.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZmM1ZGE3NWNhMjQwYzJiYzk3MDdkMTkyYmQyMzFm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shiina, can you let me speak with Ayumi alone for a bit? I promise we won’t run away or anything like that.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDI1ZTQyZGE0ODRlZmViZWMxMmJhZmEyMGIyNWEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">The angel looked at us with wide eyes, but her expression quickly relaxed.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzY2VmN2JhZjRjZTRlMWQ4NWI1MTEwNGUwYTJiZDU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay. Don’t go too far.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMWI2MGUwYzE2YTQ5ZjNhYjk3M2M2OTcyMGYxNmY5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Taking that cue, I grabbed Ayumi’s arm and dragged her to a corner of the park.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOGIyY2ZiYjdlZjQ4ZDg4M2Q5Y2Y5ZTAxNzU1ZjBl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Even after being dragged, Ayumi’s mind was still somewhere else. She wouldn’t look up at me and her eyes focused on nothing.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYTJiNjdhODgzZTRlYTNiYzEwNTNhMjk1ZTg0MWE3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Ayumi,” I said in the firmest voice I could muster.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MzhjOGFjMmQwYzQ4MDc5NTAwOWM2MjUyYWU1ZDI3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, she seemed to snap out of it. However, her disheveled hair was all over her face, making it difficult to look her in the eyes. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0YzQ5ZDRjN2ZlNDRmN2ZiMTYwOWMxZGQ0M2NkYjhk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s up with you?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMDkxN2E0OWM2MzQwNmE4OTcwNzZmYzUwMWM4YzMw"><span style="font-weight: 400">I had anticipated her reaction would be a swift bounce back to her normal self, but that wasn’t the case. She raised her head, and after moving her bangs out of the way, stared straight into my eyes.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NzY4YTZiMTAwNzQ4NjE5MzVjMjQwMWViNGFmODRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Takkun, remember our promise from before?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YTY4Mzg3ODM1MTRkMzdiODYwNmNhYmNjYmIzOTFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course. How could I forget? But what’s that got to do with anything?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZDY4Yzg0OTg4OTQ2ZmU5MjNlZjY0MTNiYzk4NTRi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead of replying to my question, Ayumi shot out one of her own. “Do you mind… if I talk to Shiina about this as well?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YzMwY2I3NzAzYTQ2MmY4Y2Q2ZjcyNGZhNWNhNWQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her eyes were glimmering as if pleading. There was no way I could refuse her.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZWZkMjhmZDUwMDQ3NjU5MTY2Y2Q2YzE1YWIwZjM3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I… Hmm… Sure, but what does she—”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMTkwYjE1NThmOTQzYjc5YzMyZGYzNWY2Y2U3N2U5"><span style="font-weight: 400">My words were cut short by my thoughts.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDg3MGI3MWExMzQ1NDNhYzdmNTI4NDk0MzMzNTBl"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Wait, don’t tell me…</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNhMTBjY2JiNjBiMDQ4OTRhOGI4YzRlNjNiNWE2Y2Zi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’ll understand soon enough,” she replied to my incomplete question with a rather sad smile.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMWI4YzRiYTZiMjRkYzJiNGRjNDkzNTg5ODljMjZh"><span style="font-weight: 400">This time, Ayumi took the lead back to our seats. However, it didn’t take us long to notice Shiina was doing something strange. No matter how I tried to parse her action, I came to the same conclusion: she was praying.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZjhmZDFhZmM3MDQyY2I5ZTI5OWRlMzVkZjA4ZWM3"><span style="font-weight: 400">She had her arms crossed in front of her chest with both hands resting on top of her shoulders. She had her eyes closed and her face pointing up at the sky.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMGI4ZTMzMzJlZjQ3M2U5ZTQxNDE5ZDgwMjgxZGFl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shiina? Are you praying?” Ayumi asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMjYxZTA5N2Q3NTQyYzBiODFhNzE3ZjE2NTk4ZDZk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing the girl’s voice, Shiina woke up from her trance. I had expected her to be rather bashful about the whole situation, but her icy expression didn’t change. Almost as if she had prepared herself for this.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTc3NDViYTdlMzQ3NDU5YjU3MzYyNWNmMTkzNjdm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I apologize. Praying is important for us to strengthen our connection with God.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNjZjZDVjOWU5OTRkNjdhZjE3OGIzYWEyYzJjOTcw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehh, right. I’m sorry I interrupted you.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZDMwZWZkY2FjZDRjZjRiMGI0MmNkOTY5N2Q3OTRi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No need to worry. Now, have you decided what you’re going to do now?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OTg3NTk2ZmY5NDQzZWRhZWQ1YzBkYjUxYjM2MmMx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes,” Ayumi said resolutely as we sat down. “Before coming here, I promised to tell Takeya something after meeting you. But considering what you told us, it’s better if I tell you this too.” She looked straight into Shiina’s eyes. “But I don’t think you’ll like to hear this. I’m sorry if it hurts you.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MjI0YjNjOGM5MTRlNzI4MTBmMzZkMWU5ZDcxOGNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">The angel looked confused, but she nodded, signifying Ayumi to continue.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYTk4MzBlZGMzMDQ2Y2FiNzkxMDg4Zjg3ZGFjYTlk"><span style="font-weight: 400">A tense silence fell upon us, only cut by the sound of my heartbeat. Ayumi was trying to find the right words for whatever she wanted to tell us, and the tension was almost unbearable.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDJmYWQ1ZWIwYjQwZjNiZTY4OTIyMGZlNWMzNmZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, it snapped, all at once.</span></p><span class="cmU1MjZmMTlhNTFiNjQ0ZGU5ZjgyN2QyMzQ5NjNhN2Zl"><br/>Stolen from its rightful author, this tale is not meant to be on Amazon; report any sightings.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNhYzZjNjkyNDY1MzRlOTM4OWM3NjYyODVmYWQ5NzU1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll start with this, Shiina. You’re probably unaware of this, but I’m not exactly what you’d consider a normal human. I’m sorry, but you won’t be able to erase my memories. I know I promised, but it won’t work.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZTM0NTk5ZGE4MTRmOTFiMmU3YjkwODk3ZDcyZmQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">After hearing Ayumi’s words, Shiina had the first genuine reaction I had ever seen on her. Her body jerked back, her mouth fell agape, and the color drained from her face, catching me off guard.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzk1MDkxYTFkZDRlZTFhNzEwMTM5YjZhY2ZiOWE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, she managed to squeeze out a sentence. “Impossible. I would have known if you were an angel.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OThjNjY5NmJiODQ2NzdhZTljNjMzZjYyMTgwOTM3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wanna try it?” Ayumi cut Shiina’s rambling short, her tone halfway between joking and deadly serious. “Erasing my memories, I mean.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZWZmMWIxNTM0MzQ1MzViMmEwMzk2NDdlMmE0NDlm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Following her bold declaration, Ayumi stood up and opened her arms wide, as if to show she was disarmed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZTI4MWRhYTJjYjRlMGM4YTMxMzhhZGRiZDIxNGNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait, Ayumi. Are you sure about this?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOTVmZGQyNzBiNzRlMWQ5ZDQ4ZDViMTMyNWU4Mjg3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes,” she said, turning to me. “This would be the result either way, so if I’m lying, I’d just be speeding up the process.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmODhkMGQ3NjMwYzQ1OGQ5YjhkZTNjZjBkYTczMDQw"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess that’s true, but…</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNiZGRkNTQ5MjczOTQ5NjA4N2FkNDhjYmI3OWRhNzNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina didn’t give me time to talk Ayumi down from her actions.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MTZlYmYzOTUzZDRkNjE5MzIwMGVlNzk5MGRmNTU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lower your head,” she commanded.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwN2Q3YThjODY3NDQyMTg4NDBjMWQ2NWM5NjkyYmUx"><span style="font-weight: 400">The tiny girl followed and exposed the top of her head to the angel. Without hesitation, Shiina rose from her seat, extended her arm, and rested her hand on Ayumi’s scalp. The two women closed their eyes in unison.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYjY2M2ZjNGIyNjRkOTM4ZWYwODg1MzE3ZTliNDhi"><span style="font-weight: 400">A few seconds elapsed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNzQ4ZTk5NTQ4ZTRlMmQ4ODBiZDczYzA1ZTVjYWQx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina removed her hands from Ayumi. From the slow and uncertain gesture, I knew right away that she had failed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjQ0MDc2YTU0NjRmNzJiMDlhNzEyMGM5YzQxNjJh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Feeling the pressure lifted from her head, Ayumi sat down and looked straight into the angel’s eyes.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZWFkMGUyOTMyMDQzMGZiN2MwOWQ2MTMxZDcxY2E4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So?” Ayumi simply asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YWQ2YTNmZWYwZTRkMzU5OWFjODUwMGI0YzExMDZm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina took her time to sit down before answering.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OTMyMmM0ZGQxMDQ5YzY5YWVhMDA2OTgzYjg4M2Rk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I couldn’t do it. I’m sure I did everything correctly, but I could still read your memories afterward.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMGM5YzhhNjBhODQ5ODhhNzYxZWE2NWRjOThjOTNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">The breath I had been holding was expelled in an almost cathartic way.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNmM2NzA1Mzg2YjRlNjU4ZWJiYTIxZDkzNTc2ZjUz"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">That was tense, but what does this mean?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNhOTMwYjk0MDFkMTRlODU4NzUzMGYxNjBhNjVkNzY1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gosh. After all these years, I guess it’s good to finally have confirmation that you really </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">are</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> weird,” I quipped. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0NTVmNjE0MGE5MjRmZGM5NWZlMWMxM2ZkYzM0NDQw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ayumi replied only with a weak smile.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMjM3ZTNjNmM1NzRlOWI5NTAwNTg4YTA4MjZkZDRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So let me guess. Though, it’s not much of a guess, but rather, a certainty at this point. All this time, you were an angel in disguise, right? And you’re hiding it from Shiina somehow?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNzljZWRkMDM0YjRmMDU5MzExZGVlYWI4ZTkwMmJl"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">I mean, isn’t that the go-to supernatural answer to everything?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNlYTE4MWUzNTQ5OTRkNTJhNmQyMTE4ZDljODIyYTJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I was plain wrong. In my defense, with the clues given to me so far, I couldn’t have figured it out by myself.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NTU0YzE3OTE5MjQyMTBiMDBjYTM5NGQ4MWU1ZTM4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, not at all,” she replied with conviction. “You’re totally off-mark. I’m categorically, one-hundred percent </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">not</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> an angel. Nothing in either your paradigm or Shiina’s can account for what I am.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNjBjOWVlYzMwMDQ3NjhiMmZmZmM5Yzk2MWJmMWM5"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">What are you talking about? We were just told what angels are. Are you saying everything Shiina believes in is… wrong?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNiYTk0ZTdiY2I0NDQyMTVhN2RkNzVhMGM0ZjYyNzE0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ayumi, you’re being way too obtuse. I still don’t get it.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOGY5MmQ4ZGNlYjRhZDBhOGQ0MmViODIwM2Y0MTNm"><span style="font-weight: 400">I had the feeling she had tremendous difficulty in saying the words she wanted to and was joking around to hide it.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZTM0ZDRlZmUyYTRhMGU5YjZhNzNmNzc2NjYxMDE0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay then. I guess I’ll just come out and say it.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMTc3NmE4M2ZhNjRjOWQ5MmYxNGI2OGRmZjg0NTk3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ayumi inhaled and exhaled deeply. That breathing routine shifted the tone of the conversation back to its original heaviness.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDE4M2MzNzgwODRhNTViNGQ2YWJlZTVhZWUxNDVj"><span style="font-weight: 400">However, before Ayumi could say a word, before my world could be fully shattered, a male voice pierced the quiet air of the park.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YjRmYjhkZTliYzRhY2U5NjExMjk1MWQxOGExNzA0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll have you stop right there, dear Ayumi.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMzVhODA5MzFkMTRiMzliMzg0ZjU1ZDYzNjNmNzZh"><span style="font-weight: 400">My mind froze, yet my heart thumped wildly in my chest. Eventually, I turned around and faced the source of the voice.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NjkzYzA4MzNjODRkMWRhOGU5ZjA1Y2RhNmU4MGVk"><span style="font-weight: 400">From the entrance of the park strolled in a tall man with soft, androgynous features and a long ponytail. A pure white, long-sleeved tunic peeked out from beneath his cloak. It was adorned with simple green and gold patterns, reaching down to his ankles.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlM2JlZmE0ODcwOTQ3NzFiZmE1MDY3YTZlMzA4ZGI5"><span style="font-weight: 400">And somehow, this weirdo cosplayer knew Ayumi.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOTY3YTI3ZDUyNjQ0MzBhNzExNDViYzhlYzM1ZGUx"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">What kind of company is she keeping that I’m not aware of?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnMyZDJkYWU3YzJkNzRiNjk4OWJmZjI5YTAzYWM5N2Vh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Archangel Michael! I-I’m so glad you came!” Shiina shouted as she rose from the bench. Her face relaxed as though she had been waiting for him.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYmQ4MDdiMzBiZjQyMjQ5MDQ2NDlkMDA2M2EwNmE4"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Archangel? Who the hell is this guy?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnM0MzE4YWZmZTk5ZjQxNjM4MTRmODlmODEwNTY0YTU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">The man responded to my question with an order.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NjY3MjFlOTczZTQ4YjViNTg5NDc4MmUyMmIzMWFh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why don’t you explain it to humans, little angel?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZjIxNjA4OTI2MzQ2MmM5NWUyMWI5MTAzYWY4ZDAy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The archangels are our glorious leaders who, through their wisdom, guide us on how best to fulfill our duties.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNmQxZWFjNzRlODRkMWJhYTU0MmU1MDkzYzBiMjlk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Very well said. School sure did drill the right things in you.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZWQ5ZWU2MDNmNjQyMmI5N2U3YjdlNWU0NjM3ODI2"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">So this guy is a big shot. But why is he here, and now? This doesn’t sound good.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNhNzQ1ZGZjNmQ4ZjQzMWRhYzI4Njc5YjI0OTVkMWE0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“An archangel? But how do you know me?” Ayumi asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMmFmZTQzNjdmMzRlNWE4OGRlYmY4MzY0NjczZGNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don’t know me, but I know you very well, dear Ayumi. Would saying I worked with your parents jog your memory?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MTJmMTBmMTkwYzQ4NjJiNTY5ZjM5Njk3NmUyYTRj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Those words were enough to make the girl gasp for air. “It… it can’t be.” I could almost hear Ayumi’s gears turning during her short pause. “So you’re an archangel, then… I see. Things are falling in place now. But calling yourself Michael, really? Like the Biblical archangel? That’s too on the nose.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZWZkYThhOWE2ZjQ2YWM4YjA0YWRiZjRmNTk3NGU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“My, my, such peppiness. You truly do become someone else in this place, don’t you?” He said with scorn. “I prefer when you’re a little bit more… docile.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOGZjODViODkxYTQwOTBhMzk4M2Q3ODg3YTAzYTZk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ayumi’s tightened fist trembled and she lost her will to reply. His words stung deep in her heart, but I couldn’t tell exactly why.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYTcxZDViNjVmNDQwNTc5MTYzNzBiMDFjYTg5OWYy"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">This guy is starting to get on my nerves.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNjMDk0Yjc2Njg5ZTRhMTk4YThjOThkNmE1ODdlNjMz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, dude,” I said, standing up, forcing the man to acknowledge my presence for the first time. “I don’t care what your relationship with Ayumi is. That tone isn’t appropriate.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZGQ2ZTg1MjAzYzQyNTc4YjcxNjczNTQwZjhmY2Zl"><span style="font-weight: 400">It looked like my words struck him in a nasty way. Archangel Michael, or whoever he was, took slow steps towards me. “Listen, small fry. I don’t think you’re aware of the pecking order here. I’d be quiet if I were you.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YWVmNTc0YjNmNzQ5Mjk4YTQ3NDg4MGE0Yzc3NmJk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ayumi was about to jump in front of me, but I stopped her with my arm. “I don’t care about any of that. There’s no reason to treat Ayumi like this.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZDBkY2Q2MDcyYTQ4YTVhNzBhZTkyOTVlNWE3NzE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">For a few seconds, time seemed to stop. What broke the suffocating silence was a shallow sigh.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyODA1NDQ2NmJkODQyMzdhOWMyMGI1NmZjMDAxOGRk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And yet he keeps going. Such a nuisance,” he said, not even addressing me. When he did return his gaze to me, it was filled with deep hate and disgust I’d never seen in my life. “Don’t say I didn’t warn you, mmkay? It’s time to take a nap.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZmViM2FlZWYyMDQyZTI4NmM4ZGVjYWNlZDBhY2I0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Without warning, I lost consciousness.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NWQ4MmJhNTVlNzRlOTZhOGRjMzNjMjA5NzY1ZWJk"><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t a slow, gentle drift into the slumber of sleep.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTM4Y2FhM2VmNTRlNjc4M2FjMDc4MGM3NzZmNjI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was instantaneous and striking.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Njc4Y2U4OTk3YjQ4ZTJiOWM0ZGZlNmZiMDhkZWZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">A total blackout.</span></p>
