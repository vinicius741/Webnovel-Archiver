</p>
<p>
  Back inside, I sat down on the edge of my bed and watched as Penny climbed in through the windows, Sparkle fluttering through behind her.
 </p>
<p>
  Ken was immediately by my side. "How did it go? What's wrong?"
 </p>
<p>
  I relayed the entirety of my conversations with Oberon, then with Spice and Shine. When I finished, Ken sighed. "I knew this was going to come up again sooner or later." He said.
 </p>
<p>
  "I don't like the thought of
  <em>
   owning
  </em>
  anybody," I exclaimed.
 </p>
<p>
  Penny rolled her eyes and sat on the window seat. "Didn't we just have this conversation about a week ago?
 </p>
<p>
  Sparkle landed atop her head with a sigh. "She really seems to be hung up on the idea."
 </p>
<p>
  "I know that," Ken said soothingly, ignoring them, "but that's how the Sidhe see it. Anyone - or anything - called to serve a single person, given purpose through serving that person, is effectively owned. Aren't they?"
 </p>
<p>
  I grimaced. "Semantics."
 </p>
<p>
  "
  <em>
   Everything
  </em>
  is semantics when you're dealing with the Sidhe," Ken said dryly. Then he sighed again. "Okay, let's do a little experiment. Sparkle, what time is it?"
 </p>
<p>
  Sparkle tipped her head. "It's about half-past six in the morning," she said. "Caley's conversation with Oberon didn't take very long at all."
 </p>
<p>
  Penny tried to look up at Sparkle, her expression astonished.
 </p>
<p>
  Ken gestured. "Could Sparkle have done that a year ago?"
 </p>
<p>
  "Oh, I surely couldn't have," Sparkle said cheerfully. "It's only because I'm Caley's that I have any real sense of the passage of time beyond sunrise, noon, sunset, midnight, and lunar cycles."
 </p>
<p>
  "Were you able to become human-sized after Caley's father sent you away?" Ken asked.
 </p>
<p>
  Sparkle shook her head. "I tried once or twice, when I was being chased by something, but I couldn't. I mean, I still knew how, I just…couldn't. It's only since Caley put my ring on that I was able to again."
 </p>
<p>
  Ken looked at me. "Being the property of - the vassal of, if you're more comfortable with that terminology - a greater power gives Fae creatures purpose and power beyond simply existing."
 </p>
<p>
  "Look at what claiming me gave me," Penny said with a nod, almost dislodging Sparkle, who giggled as she hung on. "I surely never had a humanoid form until I was yours. And I would never have been able to lurk in your shadow the way I do, or learn to shape-change to new forms, without your influence."
 </p>
<p>
  "And that doesn't bother either of you?" I asked.
 </p>
<p>
  "Should it?" Penny asked. "You protect us, nurture us, teach us, make us more than we were. And all you ask in return is our companionship and protection." She shrugged. "Seems to me we're getting the better part of the deal, but I'm not complaining."
 </p>
<p>
  Sparkle hopped off Penny's head and was suddenly human-sized, sinking to her knees in front of me and taking my hands. "Look at me, Caley! Consider what I was like when we met, compared to how I am now. Who I am hasn't really changed, but am I not more than I was at the same time?"
 </p>
<p>
  I smiled at her and squeezed her hands gently. "You most assuredly are, dear heart."
 </p>
<p>
  "Also," Ken added, "claiming Spice and Shine - calling them to your service, if you prefer - would make their leadership of your impending expansion of the Hall's influence into Faerie that much more substantial. It's a good idea all around, really."
 </p>
<p>
  They were making an awful lot of sense. The transactional nature of 'owning' a being of Faerie was, in my opinion, considerably less like actually owning someone, and more like being in a relationship with them. A hard edged one that they couldn't get out of, from the sound of it, but then neither could I. At least, not if I had any conscience or sense of responsibility at all, and I had copious amounts of both.
 </p>
<p>
  Thanks, Sister Sarah.
 </p>
<p>
  I sighed. "All right," I said. "I'm still not entirely comfortable with this, but I've got absolutely no way to argue the point. You're all making good sense, and I'm being very…" I trailed off, trying to find the right word.
 </p>
<p>
  "Human," Sparkle said with a smile. "Which is perfectly fine. It's the influence of humans that makes us what we are."
 </p>
<p>
  "And more of what we are," Penny added.
 </p>
<p>
  Ken spread his hands pointedly. "It's not just beings of Faerie who are influenced by mortals. Remember what I was like when we met?" He was practically solid-looking now, with tremendous definition. I could clearly see the rich brown of his hair, the pale green of his eyes, the fact that he was wearing a dark green button-down shirt, denim pants, and dark shoes. Even his voice had changed, losing that faint echo, like he'd been speaking to me from a distance. He was still faintly translucent, but nothing like the transparent, vaguely defined spirit I'd met almost a year earlier when I'd entered Oakwood Hall.
 </p>
<p>
  "Point taken!" I said, freeing my hands from Sparkle's gentle grasp and rising. "Just let me change into something more comfortable and we'll go back out to -"
 </p>
<p>
  "No no no no no," Sparkle said, rising hurriedly and moving to stop me. "Like this. Just like this." She beamed. "They'll be over the moon."
 </p>
<p>
  I sighed a little, but saw the nodding, eager looks on both Ken and Penny's faces, and surrendered to the inevitable.
 </p>
<p>
  "Do it at the same table you made to meet with Oberon," Ken suggested. "It'll make the impact even bigger for them."
 </p>
<p>
  I nodded, understanding immediately. I'd be saying, in essence, that what I was doing with them was of equal importance to me as meeting with the Lord of the Seelie Court. I had to admit that if the Prime Minister invited me to share lunch with him where he met with the Queen, I'd feel pretty important too, just by association.
 </p>
<p>
  I remembered then what Jessie had said about Faerie and its residents being like a distorted reflection of the mortal world. I think a lot of my understanding of the way my interactions with the Sidhe were going to work began to take shape in that moment. The idea that the way I related to them was associative made a lot of sense suddenly.
 </p>
<p>
  So back out into the clearing, soon to be entirely mine and not just land politely granted to me by the Seelie Court, we went. I wondered as I stepped out into the clearing if that would affect the way the clearing reflected the seasons. Until now, it had always been some flavor of summer outside my bedroom windows, because the land technically belonged to the Summer Court of the Sidhe. Would it now begin to show actual seasons?
 </p>
<p>
  How would that affect the fairy village? Could they manage snow? What help would they need if they couldn't? What other responsibilities would I discover as I went along?
 </p>
<p>
  Well…with Spice and Shine called to my service and truly running things, I supposed it would be up to them to let me know what they needed. Which really wasn't changing at all, was it?
 </p>
<p>
  Somehow, that settled my nerves about the whole thing more than any explanation from my friends.
 </p>
<p>
  I smiled, and turned toward the home that Spice and Shine shared as I emerged. They were already on their feet, standing on the sun deck atop their home, holding hands and watching me closely.
 </p>
<p>
  I crooked a finger and pointed at the table I'd made in the open part of the clearing, then started walking towards it.
 </p>
<p>
  Behind me, I heard Sparkle call out, "Everyone, pay heed! Lady Caitlyn Reid has chosen to call Spice and Shine to her service!"
 </p>
<span>
<br/>
  A case of literary theft: this tale is not rightfully on Amazon; if you see it, report the violation.
  <br/>
</span>
<p>
  The resulting collective cheer from behind me reassured me even more. This was, it seemed, something that not only Spice and Shine wanted…every resident of the village appeared to want it for them.
 </p>
<p>
  "It increases their standing," Penny murmured from where she was padding along beside me, "and their safety. Spice and Shine will be stronger, better able to lead, protect, and serve them. And it will give them hope that maybe some of them will be chosen to enter your service as well. Basil would be a good choice somewhere down the road."
 </p>
<p>
  I nodded a little, the same thought having just popped into my head.
 </p>
<p>
  As I stood before the little table, Penny shifted into her human form and took up a position beside it. A moment later, Sparkle arrived, shifting into her human-sized form as well and standing across the table from her. That left the side facing the village open.
 </p>
<p>
  Spice and Shine landed in the center of the table, still holding hands. They were so excited that their dragonfly-like wings remained raised and vibrating gently behind them. I called to mind the exchange I'd had with Penny when we'd done this.
 </p>
<p>
  "Spice, Shine," I said, "you have expressed a desire to be called to serve me, and only me. To be mine. Is this truly what you desire?"
 </p>
<p>
  They both nodded fervently, and Spice spoke for them as always. "Yes, Lady Reid. We want that more than anything. To serve you and be yours!"
 </p>
<p>
  Not that I had any doubt in the matter, but I felt compelled to be certain. "Shine, does Spice truly speak for you in this matter?"
 </p>
<p>
  Shine nodded eagerly again, holding up their joined hands, their fingers tightly entwined.
 </p>
<p>
  I smiled gently. "I just needed to be sure."
 </p>
<p>
  Both fairies smiled. "Of course, Lady Reid," Spice said graciously.
 </p>
<p>
  I took a deep breath and let it out. "I would welcome your service. Speak your vows."
 </p>
<p>
  "In exchange for your protection and guidance," Spice began, Shine nodding along at every point, "we offer our lives, our skills and power in your service; to be your eyes, ears, and hands in Faerie, to advise you, guide your followers, and protect you and your home from harm as best we can, for as long as we live!"
 </p>
<p>
  "Then I accept your service," I said gravely, "and offer my protection and guidance in return."
 </p>
<p>
  As when I'd claimed Penny, I could literally feel the power vibrating in the vows we exchanged. This was deep, powerful magic we were engaged in, and I could feel it hooking into me and binding the two fairies to me.
 </p>
<p>
  Between us, there was a flash of brilliant light above the surface of the table, and a single ring clattered to its surface. I picked it up and looked at it…an elegant, slender ring made of two interwoven bands of metal, one copper, one silver. On the inside surface were two strings of runes, one on the copper band, one on the silver…presumably their true names.
 </p>
<p>
  Spice and Shine were literally quivering with excitement and joy as I slid their conjoined ring onto the finger the one on which I wore Sparkle's and Penny's. I realized then that not only did I never take either Sparkle or Penny's rings off, I never gave them a second thought or even felt their weight. Clearly they were profoundly magical objects.
 </p>
<p>
  As the ring slid into place, the two fairies grew subtly until they were only a hair smaller than Sparkle was in her natural form, and their radiances flared brightly as they hugged one another, then zoomed over to hug my hand tightly.
 </p>
<p>
  "Thank you, Caley!" Spice said fervently.
 </p>
<p>
  &lt;&lt;We won't let you down,&gt;&gt; a lovely, quiet, delicate voice rang in my head, like the tinkling of tiny, musical bells. &lt;&lt;Not ever!&gt;&gt;
 </p>
<p>
  I blinked in shock, meeting Shine's eyes in astonishment, absolutely certain whose voice I'd finally heard. She beamed up at me.
 </p>
<p>
  "Shine says," Spice began, then stopped and grinned widely. "Well, I think you know what she said."
 </p>
<p>
  "I heard her," I said, feeling happy tears welling in my eyes. "I heard her very well."
 </p>
<p>
  From all around us, a second cheer rose up. When I looked around, I saw that every resident of the village was gathered around us, pressed as close as they could to witness the event. Now they were celebrating, fairies swirling happily in the air, gnomes dancing joyfully in the grass.
 </p>
<p>
  Sparkle hugged me tightly as Penny raised her arms and called out, "This calls for a celebration!"
 </p>
<p>
  &lt;&lt;And it means I can run the race for you tomorrow,&gt;&gt; Shine said shyly from where she and Spice were now standing beside my hand on the table, holding one another.
 </p>
<p>
  "Yes you can," I said softly. "I have every faith in your ability to do so."
 </p>
<p>
  Her wings vibrated behind her, a gesture I now recognized as one of intense joy. &lt;&lt;I'll fly faster than any fairy has ever flown!&gt;&gt;
 </p>
<p>
  Clearly, the residents of Faerie loved an excuse to party, because in moments the village was covered in party streamers and decorative bunting in a riotous mix of colors…mostly bright red and gleaming silver, but I saw some forest green, rich purple, and dark blue mixed in as well. All of us were being celebrated, I supposed.
 </p>
<p>
  I quickly moved the little table and chairs over next to my bedroom windows so that Ken wouldn't be left out of the festivities, and wasn't at all surprised to be met by him carrying a serving tray containing a variety of sweet treats and traditional fairy libations. He winked, passed them through the window, and the party was joined in earnest.
 </p>
<p>
  Sparkle, Spice, Shine and I held court at the table. Sparkle sat in the chair across from me, while Spice and Shine occupied little wooden chairs that I magicked up and set atop the table for them. Everyone who lived in my little settlement came by to greet us and congratulate Spice and Shine, and I thought that more than a few of them looked a bit envious.
 </p>
<p>
  About the time I realized that Penny had slipped away during the initial scrum, she came padding back over in her natural form, followed by her brother. He still looked a bit ragged and was still limping a little, but his eyes were bright, attentive, and taking in everything. Something about his body language suggested restrained excitement…maybe it was the way the tufts of red fur at the tips of his otherwise black ears and tails kept twitching and flipping.
 </p>
<p>
  He was, I noticed curiously, visibly smaller - though not by much - than his sister. I wondered if that was because I had claimed her.
 </p>
<p>
  "Lady Reid," Penny said formally, sitting at my feet, "allow me to formally introduce my brother. I fear he has no proper name as yet."
 </p>
<p>
  I bent down, offering the black and red fox beside her my hand, which he sniffed deeply, then nodded to himself. "It's all true," he said reverently. "What our grand-dam taught us about Oakwood Hall and its Guardian." He looked up at me appealingly. "Guardian, our family served and protected yours for generations, and I see that my sister has taken up that duty again. I beg of you, let me join her and resume the service of our clan to yours in good faith."
 </p>
<p>
  He lowered his head and extended one foreleg in what I took to be the fox equivalent of a bow.
 </p>
<p>
  I smiled at him, caressing his muzzle and lifting his chin. "You needn't bow to me, brave one," I said gently. "You had nearly broken free of the magic shackling you by yourself. I just lent a hand. However," I added before he could say anything, "if Spice and Shine agree, I could very much use your help to protect the village and clearing here, and eventually - hopefully - a larger demense."
 </p>
<p>
  "Give me a name, Guardian, as your ancestors did," he said breathlessly, "and I will guard these lands for you until my muzzle grays and my legs fail me."
 </p>
<p>
  It clicked into my mind then, as if it had been lurking and just waiting for the right moment…the perfect name for him. "Spice? Shine?"
 </p>
<p>
  They came to the edge of the table and looked down at him curiously. He returned their gaze evenly, almost pleadingly.
 </p>
<p>
  Spice looked up at me. "Of course we'll be happy to have his aid, Caley," she said warmly. "And any of their kin who manage find their way free in the future."
 </p>
<p>
  The dusk fox's eyes returned to me. "Guardian?"
 </p>
<p>
  I smiled at him and stroked his ears gently. "Garm," I said softly. "Your name is Garm. Welcome home."
 </p>
<p>
  A shiver ran through him, from his nose to the tips of his twin tails. He breathed out a long sigh and grew visibly until he was almost the same size as Penny. As it had been with Sparkle and Spice before I'd claimed them 'properly,' I could distantly sense his presence, but without the immediacy of his sister and the fairies at the table with me. And he did not, thankfully, manifest either a ring or a humanoid form.
 </p>
<p>
  "Thank you, Guardian!" He said happily. "That is a powerful name, with long history." Then he looked at Penny. "My name is Garm!" he said with obvious joy.
 </p>
<p>
  Penny laughed. "Yes it is, brother. Come, I'll show you the boundaries of the clearing and fill you in on all that's happened since you arrived."
 </p>
<p>
  They trotted off together, their tails held high and waving jauntily, surrounded by cheering fairies.
 </p>
<p>
  Close to noon, as most of the party had naturally gravitated back to the village on the other side of where my bedroom windows hung mid-air in the clearing, I leaned over to speak to Ken. He had been sitting on the window seat just inside the open window, quietly soaking in the good cheer as best he could without being able to come out into the clearing.
 </p>
<p>
  "Can you explain the rings to me?" I asked. "Why did claiming Penny bind her to me so thoroughly, but naming Garm didn't?"
 </p>
<p>
  Ken smiled lopsidedly. "Why do you keep asking me about aspects of magic that nobody really understands?"
 </p>
<p>
  I huffed a little laugh. "Because I'm getting better at figuring out the rest for myself?"
 </p>
<p>
  He nodded a little. "Touché. I think it's your magic interacting with Fae magic," he said thoughtfully. "Mind you, this is pure conjecture. I have no evidence at all to support it. I think its your magic reacting to the creation of the bond by making a physical token to represent it." He shrugged. "As to the difference between Penny and Garm, I should think that would be obvious."
 </p>
<p>
  I considered it for a moment, then nodded. "I suppose it is. Confusing, but obvious."
 </p>
<p>
  Spice and Shine swirled down from wherever they'd gone to land on my shoulders. "This party's probably going to run until dusk, Caley. If you wanted to slip away, now's probably a good time."
 </p>
<p>
  &lt;&lt;Nobody will mind,&gt;&gt; Shine added in her shy, delicate, beautiful little mental voice. &lt;&lt;They know you have a lot of other things to deal with.&gt;&gt;
 </p>
<p>
  I smiled. "Thank you both. Thank you both so much." I rose and stretched a little, as did Sparkle. I smiled at her. "You can stay out a while if you want to. I'm sure you'd be welcome at the party."
 </p>
<p>
  "Of course she would!" Spice said stoutly. "And we'd be happy to have her."
 </p>
<p>
  "You're sure?" Sparkle asked hopefully.
 </p>
<p>
  I smiled a bit more. "Go on, have fun. I'll leave the window open for you and Penny both. I'll just be practicing my magic this afternoon, nothing particularly exciting."
 </p>
<p>
  In the blink of an eye, Sparkle shrank to her natural size and joined Spice and Shine as they swirled up into the air and over the top of the window frame.
 </p>
<p>
  "Don't forget to get some rest!" I called after them. "We don't know how tomorrow's going to go yet!"
 </p>
<p>
  I watched them go, then smiled at Ken. "Give me a hand back in, would you? This dress is lovely, but the skirts aren't great for taking large steps."
 </p>
<p>
  He laughed and offered me a hand as I carefully climbed back inside.
 </p>
