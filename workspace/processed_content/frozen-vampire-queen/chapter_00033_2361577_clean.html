   Lunaria felt her blood boiling. A fierce and barely containable rage bubbled inside of her. She stayed calm for Emma, but now that she was gone, she let a little bit of her anger surface.
   <em>
    Besides, the most dangerous person in this whole city is right here. The Silver-General.

   The dragon found her voice. She tinted it with a bit of her moon magic. “Do you think that something like this is a good idea?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “That’s Esverin,” the girl said with a smile. “As her sympathizer, this is more than ideal for us. A chance meeting with Lunaria is no small consequence. It must be that the lady had sent you.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The woman with clawed hands looked around at her nearest comrades who’d refused the order to chase after Emma. She widened her eyes as many of them fell to the floor.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Lunaria grinned as they fell around her like a cascade of dominoes. “Finally taken notice, have you?
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Esverin frowned as she looked around. “A bunch of lost souls withdrawn from their vessels. Is this the power of moon magic?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Lunaria shrugged. “So...What is it that you want to do? Despite having so many people, you will not be successful. I may be more patient than my brothers and sisters, but I’m not a pushover.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Esverin grinned. “No, you’ll do just fine. I much prefer it this way.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The Silver-General unclasped her white robes, and they fell away. Her arms betrayed feathers, and her legs ended in sharp talons. Feathers ran along a quarter of her belly, covering it in a layer of white.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “A harpy?” Lunaria asked.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Esverin nodded. “Though, not exactly the same anymore. You see, unlike other harpies, I was deemed to be sufficient for her holy order. The church transformed me into something that transcends harpies altogether. I’m an angel.” She spread her feathered arms out wide, and wings sprouted from them.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The sight was something grotesque to Lunaria. The girl had given away her identity as a harpy. Now, she was something neither harpy nor human. It was a disgusting cross, and it made the dragon’s heart sink.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Lunaria remembered the statue of the fair goddess. “Did Lady Reimei condone this?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Esverin’s smile widened, showcasing rows of sharp teeth. “Why don’t you take a guess. Aren’t you supposed to be the smart one?”

   “No, I will speak no longer. I don’t care what your motives are, but you will die today.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “Oh, don’t say that,” the harpy plead in a fake voice. Her voice changed in timbre and tone, until finally, she found what she was looking for. Emma’s voice croaked into the air. “Don’t you love me?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The world around the two fell away. Their legs floated downwards, until they were greeted with white rock beneath their feet. White sand surrounded them on all sides.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Esverin looked around in bewilderment, until her eyes gazed upon the starry sky. Above the two, a gorgeous blue globe sat. It was so far away, yet it was so massive that she could almost touch it. A startled screech left the harpy’s throat.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “The moon?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Yet, the hand that caught her would allow no more words. Lunaria’s fingers coiled around Esverin’s neck like a vice grip. Her eyes shone in a vivid purple. They twinkled like the stars above them.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Esverin wiggled around in the dragon’s grip. She hammered her claws towards the girl’s fair skin, but they would not penetrate. The silver claws that were supposed to rend all evil in the world could not even pass through this barrier of skin. The harpy’s eyes widened at the scales adorning the dragon’s arm.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Lunaria’s words were quiet but firm. “That will be the last time you use this.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The dragon’s hand turned into a large black claw. It tore through the barrier of skin in Esverin’s neck easily. A loud snap was heard as Lunaria crushed the harpy’s windpipe. The Silver-General’s blood splattered onto Lunaria’s face and hissed.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “You’re still alive?” Lunaria asked. There was no more emotion left in her voice. It was an innocent question. One that she already knew the answer to.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Her other fist punched through the harpy’s chest, and her large claw wrapped around the thumping heart. With one pull, she freed the organ from its prison.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The dragon dropped the harpy to the ground with a long sigh. “I wanted to get something out of you, but you chose the worst person to imitate. I can’t believe that Lady Reimei would allow something like this to happen.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   She frowned at the corpse that slowly floated down towards the white sand. “In this place, your body will rot, but don’t worry. You will not suffer. Your next life will come just as quickly as this one ended.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The ground beneath Lunaria’s feet responded to her call. White sand began moving on its own. It covered the body and unbeating heart of the harpy and formed a small white mound. The dragon smiled at the white particles beneath her. “How long has it been since we buried someone here?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   She looked around, and thousands of other mounds sat as a vivid reminder. “That girl hadn’t even noticed.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Lunaria sank into the sand slowly herself. When she was completely covered from head to toe, the world shifted. She was back in a familiar plaza. The men all around her looked at her in bewilderment.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   One of them was so shocked, he ran towards her. “Where is she? What happened to the Silver-General!?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Lunaria scratched her ear and scrunched up her face. “She’s dead, and unless you want to join her, I suggest all of you lay down your arms. If you impede me on the way to what is mine, then I will have to remove you as if you are an obstacle.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The dragon walked calmly forwards. With the glowing bracelet on her wrist, she could already locate her prized future wife. No one impeded her. There was no one who was daring or stupid enough to stand in front of her.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   They simply watched as the bane of their existence passed by them.
