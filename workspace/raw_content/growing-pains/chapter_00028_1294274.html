Probably a bad habit I should break before I messed up with someone more threatening than a guy that used illusions to rob jewelry stores.</span></p>

<p class="cnNkNTc1MDExZjk4NzQ0ZGQ5Y2FhOTQ0NzEzNGYyMTUz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Which meant I needed to find a way of training myself to think of Ki sense just like my sight or hearing including how to react to what that sense was telling me in combat.</span></p>

<p class="cnMyYjEyNTQzNjlkMDRhNDNhNjczOGYxNmFiZDUxMDlh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Which meant I couldn’t </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">know</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> someone was coming to fight me or it’d defeat the purpose. Like learning to fight in the dark by waiting until your eyes adjusted and then training. I mean, yeah, eventually you would learn how to do it, but you’d waste so much time. And it wouldn’t even train you for sudden changes like if someone turned the lights off suddenly.</span></p>

None of them would have the free time to ambush me randomly throughout the day to make sure I was paying attention and that was assuming that they agreed to do that in the first place.</span></p>
