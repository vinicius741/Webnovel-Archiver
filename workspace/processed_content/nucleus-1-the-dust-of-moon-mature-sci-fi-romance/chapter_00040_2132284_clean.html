   </span>
   ilinur couldn't predict what awaited her now. Being summoned at this time of day was never a good sign for government agents like herself; it usually meant demotion, corporal punishment, death or things even worse.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The crimson corridor stretched before her, bathed in the glow of cold fusion lanterns. Each step of her leather boots was a drumbeat on the polished marble, accompanied by the sways of her onyx red silk robe.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She arrived at the appointed room — Chamber 42. The opulent door stood before her, its surface an ornate tableau.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Through the seams of the door, she could hear the sounds of carnal indulgence — Governor Zu-Shao Qin's deep voice moaning in pleasure, accompanied by the soft whimpers of a woman and the wet sucking sounds of fleshly desires. With her sharp hearing, she recognized the cadence of Secretary Shazmeen Varma's breaths between each of Shao's groans — knew them as intimately as one knows the blade they've crossed in battle.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur's hand hesitated on the handle, feeling the vibrations of what lay beyond. Her little finger, half-sprouted and motionless, could feel the cool metal.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As silence fell like a shroud behind the door, it hissed open, revealing the aftermath of hedonistic ritual within. Shazmeen emerged. Stains of white, the spoils of her labor, marred her blouse near her chest and lower lip, evidence of the appetites she had pleased, trophies of her conquest over the man who ruled them both.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Good evening, Dinu. Here to receive your punishment by Governor Qin?" Shazmeen taunted, her voice smooth like velvet and laced with the taste of shared complicity. The Secretary of Province knew her place in the Governor’s mind, and certainly believed it was above Dilinur’s.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "None of your business, Shazmeen," Dilinur responded evenly, trying to hide the revulsion stirring in her stomach.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You know, your career would have been much easier if you used your femininity more. Appeal to…the base needs of men above us," Shazmeen held up a vial containing more of the white fluid, fresh and thick, its source unmistakably clear.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "To each our own, Shazmeen," Dinu said cautiously, averting her gaze.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Pride can only get you so far, Dinu," the Djinno woman said in a condescending tone.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As Shazmeen left, Dilinur entered the lion's den, the lingering scent of the man’s release heavy in the air. The door sealed behind her with a quiet click as she crossed into the room. "Governor Qin, I have come as you requested."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Good, Dinu. Good..." Governor Zu-Shao Qin reclined lazily on an opulent throne-like chair, his usual attire of red and black robes undisturbed but radiating an aura of satisfaction. The air itself seemed to bend around him, laced with the remnants of Shazmeen's ministrations.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Sit," he commanded, gesturing toward a plain wooden chair opposite his own — a mere dwarf compared to his grand seat.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As she complied, her muscles coiled tight, Dilinur's gaze skittered across the room, taking in the dragons embroidered on fine tapestries and the golden chalices standing sentinel on a sideboard crafted from darkwood.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "So, once again you have chosen to protect insignificant civilians while letting our enemies slip away. Subject S has fled from Earth, a ZenFusion engineer has escaped with a copy of the Moondust Crystal data to Alliance lands. And that little android awarded to him, U6-M9 — gone! No one at the Logistic Hub could tell me what happened. Useless Peons," Shao began, his voice low. "You have all failed me."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yes, milord," Dilinur murmured, bowing her head slightly, though the iron grip of intimidation circled her throat like a collar.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “You have one chance to explain yourself,” Shao said with eyes that glinted like sharp daggers.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I did what was best for the people — and our public image." Dilinur reported carefully, her fingers drumming silently on her thighs.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Shao's eyes gleamed with cold interest. "Public image."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yes, milord. In light of recent Radi-Mon incidents and growing distrust towards the government, showing willingness to protect should calm the people's minds." Dilinur noted, her tone neutral but weighted.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Hmm." Shao's fingers rested on his armrest. "It would be pleasant to have less stupid locals joining the Sand Lotus."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Indeed. In the long run, it'd also lessen the need for excessive security, the cost conserved could be funneled to your expenditure in hosting social events and — other equally pleasant activities —" Dilinur listed, before Shao cut her off with a wave.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "No need to remind me," he smiled, though it didn't reach his eyes. Shao's smile remained cold, calculating. "On a side note, while I could care less about a missing android, there must be a reason why someone would take her."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur could feel her own posture tensing, however slightly. "My apologies. I should have foreseen the contingency."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You should have," Shao leaned back in his throne-like chair, swirling the contents of his chalice, "But such menial tasks are beneath us. Have Seneschal Wei investigate it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It shall be done," Dinu bowed once more, deeper this time as she picked up the lingering scent of Shazmeen's earlier visit.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "This brings us to the next matter we should address," he continued, unfurling a dark yellow holographic scroll across the distance between them. The scroll depicted the Moon’s cratered visage, marked with cryptic symbols. "The Moondust Crystal is nestled within an assemblage. The visualized data shows that this Vault of Primal Urges is located deep in the core of Osram. You will retrieve it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Of course, it should be a most exhilarating task," Dilinur focused on the map, noting a location marked for extraction.
  </span>
 </p>
 <span>
  <br/>
  This tale has been unlawfully obtained from Royal Road. If you discover it on Amazon, kindly report it.
  <br/>
 </span>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That it is. For this time, Prince Joon-Seok of the Choson Peninsula will assist you," Shao said, the name rolling off his tongue. "He is knowledgeable in operations beyond Earth. Our military exercises have also ended prematurely, our troops recalled to join this mission."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yes, milord. And I assume an individual of such stature demands some protocols?" Dinu replied carefully.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "As one of the Emperor’s most favored psionic champions, to have Joon-Seok join us is an immense honor," Shao’s gaze dropped, a deliberate trail from her eyes down to her chest. She felt the weight of his stare like a physical touch, lecherous and calculating, as if undressing her resolve. "You’ve been selected to be the Hostess as the Prince visits Taipei tomorrow. In your absence, your usual administrative duties in Taipei will be handled by Seneschal Wei Cheng and Secretary Shazmeen."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dinu fought not to squirm under the scrutiny, to maintain the composure expected of her station. In the past, Shao had taken advantage of her subordinate position in various ways, ones that had disgraced women like herself.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Thank you, Governor. I’ll be sure to observe the protocols expected," she managed, her voice steady but her pulse quickened, her hands clenched into fists, her mind racing with estimations when this meeting would end.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Not yet!" Shao's voice interrupted as if he could sense Dinu's thoughts. His eyes narrowed as he continued, "It is time for your carnal punishments."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "M-my lord," Dilinur stammered, feeling her throat tighten as she sat down. "Might you prefer to rest instead?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "No need to worry. Your chastity will remain intact," Shao replied, standing up from his grand chair and circling around the table towards Dilinur. He grabbed her breasts with both hands, causing her to gasp in shock.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Shao began massaging her breasts, squeezing them with a possessive ownership that made Dilinur shudder. She did not resist as he undid her robes’ buttons and unlaced her corset, the cool air prickling her naked skin. His hands roamed over her naked body, touching, squeezing, and tracing patterns that sent both chills and heat coursing through her veins. His touch was invasive, and Dilinur felt her dignity dissolve under his leering gaze.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Turn around," he commanded.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   And she did, feeling her cheeks flame as he admired her naked back. He traced the curve of her spine with a cruel finger, leaving a trail of goosebumps in its wake.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Kneel," he then ordered.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur obeyed, her heart pounding against her ribs. He ran his fingers to her head, unclasping her hairpin then pulling her hair roughly into a makeshift leash which he held onto possessively, the degradation reflecting in his eyes. "Letting Skarn escape, failing to obliterate the Alliance invaders who intrude on our territory. Were it another province, your mistakes would warrant an execution or a tour in the Empress’s Gardens."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yes, of course," she replied in a tone devoid of emotions. As the Governor’s hand grabbed her, she held herself still, feeling his grip tighten almost painfully as he pulled her close. Her heart raced as he traced the curves of her body. She swallowed hard, feeling like a helpless doll in his grubby hands. He kneaded and pinched the flesh of her breasts without any regard for her comfort.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yet today, I am feeling generous. Your failures and deficiencies are forgiven." his fingers dug into her nipples, causing sharp pains that shot through her entire body.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She bit down on her lip to stifle the cries that threatened to escape, but they bubbled up inside her anyway - small whimpers that made their way out despite her efforts. "Your mercy honors me…milord."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Do better next time," he finished, his breath hot on her neck, she could feel him smirking as he continued his assault on her senses.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   From behind, his lips moved slowly along her shoulder and neck. She closed her eyes tightly before opening them again when sharp teeth grazed her neck. His tongue invaded her cheek roughly, tasting every inch as his grip on her hair tightened.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   And then he rose behind her. Through a mirror wall to the side, Dilinur Altai saw him pull out something—his large penis, hard and throbbing. She braced herself for whatever humiliation he would subject her to next.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   In the minutes that followed, she felt him rubbing his engorged member against the back of her head, his breathing ragged and erratic. Shao's moans grew louder.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Eventually, his manhood traced downward before a hot, sticky liquid began to spurt onto her neck, sending shivers through her body. Shao was cumming—and the sheer volume of his release was both frightening and baffling to Dilinur. How could a man produce so much semen in such a short time?
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As the sticky warmth trickled down her spine, Dilinur's mind raced with disgust. She clenched her fists tighter, willing herself not to lash out at him. She knew better than to provoke the ire of someone as powerful as a Governor.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   For it was him that had helped her rise through the ranks of the Imperium since her graduation.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   After what felt like an eternity, Shao's breathing began to return to normal, his grip on her hair loosening.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Reaching for a box of nanoweave tissue paper on the table, he wiped away the evidence of his perverse pleasure on her neck and torso. Even the tissue's soft fabric offered no solace as it absorbed the white juice on her back.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He stepped back from her, allowing Dilinur to catch her breath as well. She remained kneeling on the cold floor, however, too afraid to move until given permission.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You may rise," Shao finally said after what seemed like an eternity had passed since he last spoke. His voice was hoarse but satisfied—a predator sated by its prey.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur rose shakily to her feet, wincing as she adjusted her robes and corset in an attempt at modesty once more. Her body ached in places she didn't know could hurt; every fiber of her being screamed for revenge against this man.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He backed away away suddenly, leaving Dilinur gasping for air and trembling with fear and revulsion. The coldness of the room contrasted sharply with the heat that burned within her now, making it difficult to focus on anything but the persistent trembling of her legs.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She turned to see his hands brush against something cool at his waist - a Medi-Vap - before he brought it up to press against her lips. "Open," he commanded softly, watching intently as she obeyed despite wanting nothing more than to spit in his face right now. The cool mist inside filled her mouth as the minor wounds on her breasts and neck healed, leaving no trace of the violation that had occurred.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That should suffice," Shao said with a smirk, releasing her hair from his grasp. "Now, get dressed."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She rose from the floor, the cool air of the room prickling her bare skin. Picking up her corset with trembling hands, she laced it back up, its tight embrace a familiar, if not comforting, sensation. She slipped into her robes, the fabric heavy and oppressive against her corseted body. With a sigh, she picked up her hairpin from the table, fastening her hair in a neat bun.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Back to business. The Terra Alliance will most likely be there on Osram. But the Emperor expects results, not excuses. Secure the Moondust Crystal and ensure its integrity, by any means." Shao returned to his throne and sat down, his tone once again filled with merciless determination.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "By any means," Dilinur echoed, the phrase tasting like ash upon her tongue as she sat in her chair.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Fail me again, and there will be more punishments," he purred, leaning back in his chair and folding the holographic scroll on his desk before handing it to Dilinur. "Take this Holo Scroll with you. You leave at dawn to meet Joon-Seok at the Mount Sword Lake Hotel."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As she took the Holo Scroll with both hands and rose from her seat, Dilinur couldn't help but cast one final glance at Shao. His smug satisfaction was evident as he turned away from her and stared out of the window at the full Moon hanging in the night sky.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Osram awaits, Dinu," he muttered, his voice laced with a dark promise. "With the Moondust Crystal, comes a power not only to dominate those Radi-Mons but also to bring the Five Realms under Imperium's reign. Succeed at this, and we’d both ascend the hierarchy within the Legion, away from this backwater island."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Indeed, milord," she whispered before stepping back into the crimson corridor. Were it in her power, she would cast a spell on Shao just to see him squirm. But for now, she would play the game. One day, the right time to have her revenge would come.
  </span>
