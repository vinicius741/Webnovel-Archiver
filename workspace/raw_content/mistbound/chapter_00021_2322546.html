<p class="cnM3Nzk2ZDhiOWY5YjQ4ZDA5MGJhMDE0NDc5NTNhZjBj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, you’re Research Assistant Ernesto?” Maeryn asked. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzMTk1OWIxYTQxMjQzNjA4YTExYmQ2MmQyZmFmMWNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">They were in a meeting room on the second floor of the recruitment center. Apparently it was policy to require both parties meet in the same building to ensure that job requests didn’t get lost. Ernesto hadn’t been available until after 4:00, according to his request, so Maeryn had spent the rest of the day browsing the various flyers and exploring the city. She had the beginnings of a map started in her notebook, but it would take a lot more exploration to finish it. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxYmI2OGVkOTNjMjRiZjI4Y2ViYThkMjUwZDQ3YTQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto, a heavily tanned young man who looked to be in his early twenties with unruly dark hair, fidgeted in his seat with nervous energy. He kept wringing his hands and looking anywhere but at Maeryn’s face. His clothes were slightly rumpled, disheveled almost, and his anxiousness was palpable even from across the table. “Ah, yes. That’s me. You, you’re the one who wants to take on my request, right? To check on Master Graves?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlZTgwMzI2NmZkNDQ1YmE5OGY5MTVhZWEwNDBlMjk3"><span style="font-weight: 400">So that was the name of the researcher they were checking on. The flyer hadn’t specified it. “Yes. I am Captain Maeryn of the airship Stonewing. I’m willing to transport you to and from the research site you specified. I just need to know when you want to go.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM1OWMzZTUwZTVkMTQzZGQ4YjExNGYxMDMwZDVmYTM5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Immediately!” Ernesto cried out, then shrunk in response to his own outburst. “Sorry. Yes. I, um, would prefer that we leave as soon as possible. Or, practical I suppose. I haven’t heard from him in almost a month. I know he gets caught up in his research at times, and sometimes he’ll completely forget I even exist, but he just needs a little reminder, I’m sure.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0NzQyMjE1OWI5ZTQ4NjZiNmIzMTk3YWEwNTkzOGQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn paused, feeling an unexpected wave of pity. She’d met other people who had been more-or-less abandoned by their masters in their days of apprenticeship, back in Geova. They were usually picked up by someone else in the same field, or gently guided to another profession, but it seemed like Ernesto hadn’t had the same luck. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0OTNkZGM0MTc5OTRiOWZhNThhYTU3MjZmZTZhYjM3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand,” she said simply. “We can leave first thing in the morning. Say, seven o’clock? That will allow me to ensure that our ship is ready to leave.” Maeryn leaned across the table. “Just so we’re clear, I’m only transporting you, correct? You’re not going to insist I bring along a whole research lab’s worth of things? Stonewing</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">isn’t designed for transporting large amounts of material.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiMzFkZTRlZGZkYjQ2YTQ4NTI3NTlmYTRkZjU1MTdm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, no, just me,” Ernesto assured her hurriedly. “This really is just a check-up. There and back. Shouldn’t take more than a day, day and a half at most to get there and back. Depending on how fast your airship flies.” He wrung his hands again, clearly nervous that he’d somehow offended her. “Oh, and seven o’clock is fine.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOGNkZjI2YTgwMzRjOWY4NDMwOGM1NmViYzYzMDk1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mearyn nodded neutrally. “Then I think we have a deal. Meet me at the airfield at seven.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTY2MzQyNDUwMjRlOGI5MDkwYzhhODM3NWUwZjlh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto visibly relaxed, his shoulders losing some of their tension. “I’ll be there. Thank you, Captain. Master Graves is a brilliant man, but he can be... absent-minded.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YWMxM2Q4MDdkYTRlZTA4NmNmMDY2YWJlMWY3NzUw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know the type,” she assured him. “I’m sure he’s fine. Now come on, let’s tell the receptionists that we’ve both approved the request and go get ready.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5YzA1MjRlYzMyNzQxMmE4ODc1ZjdhNjZjZjJlNTc5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Captain.” Ernesto nodded eagerly. They signed the paperwork and went their separate ways, with Maeryn absently making her way to the nearest fountain. There was still a couple of hours before sunset, so she had some time before she needed to meet with her companions.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMjhmOGY5YzgwNTQyODg4NmYwZWRiMGRjODFkYzcw"><span style="font-weight: 400">As she’d taken to doing lately, she sat down at a bench and wrote about the most recent events in her notebook. After jotting down the deal she’d made with Ernesto, Maeryn tapped her pencil against the page thoughtfully. “Graves… what kind of man is he? And why on earth would someone name their kid Graves? That </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">has </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">to be an assumed name of some kind. Or… maybe a noble family name or something.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMxZjQwZGE4Mjg5NjRkOTY5NWYwYTFiZjY4YjM3Zjkz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Curiosity stoked, she flipped her notebook shut. She wanted answers, and thankfully, there was an easy place where she could probably get them. “Guess it’s my turn to do some research at Zephyr Research Central. Time to tell me who you are, Research Master Graves.”</span></p>
<hr/>
<p class="cnM0ZWNiNDc0MDE1ODQyZmE5NDZlYjM5ZWI5ZGMyMzE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Daniel d’Greenstone was absolutely in his element. His right hand wrote feverishly, barely lifting the pencil from paper as he rapidly summarized what he was reading in shorthand. Hours of tediously poring over summaries had finally paid off. He’d found something. It had been little more than a side note, a tiny observation in the midst of every other resounding failure.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMjJkMmM1OGQ0MTQ3ZWU4YWNmZWFlZWZmNGQ0ZTFi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Research Master Veridian had received permission to take one of Airspire’s livestock - a very old goat, apparently - and lowered it into one of the Mist-covered fields nearby from the safety of an airship specifically designed for hovering in place. As expected, the goat had very rapidly undergone Mist Mutation and, once it had turned completely mad, Veridian’s crew had killed it with prepared fire magic. But one sentence in particular had caught Dan’s eye.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMTkwODc5OWI1ZjRjM2Y5M2NhODM2YjIwYjRiNWE2"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">The concentration of Mist seemed to increase briefly moments before the goat succumbed to Mist Mutation. </span></em></p>
<p class="cnNlYjA4NWNiY2Q4YzRmMGY5OTM1ODhkYTc4NGVjNjEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Why? Why would that happen? Why had no one thought to repeat the experiment? Had Veridian truly managed to capture, accidentally or not, a method of producing the Mist? </span></p>
<p class="cnM0MGE3ZTJhNjEwMjQ0ODBhMzBlOGUwMTU1NjI4YjA0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan would have previously stated confidently that the Mist concentration would have </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">lessened </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">minutely at the moment of Mist Mutation, as the goat would have been breathing it in, leaving less in the atmosphere. But if the opposite had indeed happened, then somehow the goat had </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">generated </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">the Mist! How? Why? What process could have possibly occurred to make that happen? </span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZDZkNTE1MTUzZTRiMWFiYzdkYmI4NzllNjg1Y2U0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan’s mind whirled with questions, and he wrote down every single one. Was it something in the goat’s diet? Maybe something in its bones or blood? Was it the age of the animal? Was it a female or male goat? Did it only happen with mammals? What was the determining factor? “Luke! I need all detailed research reports in the last three months that involve exposure of animals to the Mist! Start with the most recent and go backwards!” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDBjMmNlOTE0YTQyZmRhYjczNGU5MjdmZDBmMDFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">The research assistant had been invaluable over the course of the day. Luke had saved Dan an enormous amount of time with his intimate knowledge of the archives, and Dan already planned to tip him </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">extremely </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">well. The boy with the missing tooth saluted sharply. “Yes, sir! I’m on it!” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyOWI5MjI5ZTk2NzQ2Y2NiZjczNDg1NmRhZDNkY2Ji"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hardly any time passed at all before Luke returned with a number of folders on a cart, wheeling it over to Dan. “Are you done with these reports, sir?” he asked, gesturing at the desk where a couple of dozen useless summaries from equally useless researchers littered the workspace. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1NzcxNzUyNjk0MDRkNWE4NDE5YjU5MWQ2OTRkZTE0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, take them please.” Dan immediately plucked one of the new folders at random, opening it and scanning its contents, looking for what must be there - the moment of Mist Mutation. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5Zjg0YjUyMzU5MTQwNWNhY2Q0YmFkMmQzOGE3N2Q2"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">… the Mist swirled around the ewe, briefly obscuring it… </span></em></p>
<p class="cnNhZGFjMmI0MDQyZDQ2ZWI5MTk2NDk3MWQzMGRjZDYy"><span style="font-weight: 400">The feeling of discovery strengthened in Dan’s chest, and he hurriedly picked out the next one.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMmRkMGU2NTdhODQzNTNiMjFhOTQ5NGUxNDQwNDQ1"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">… The gecko froze in place in the moments before mutation. Some of my crew stated that the Mist seemed momentarily stronger, but we were unable to corroborate the observation… </span></em></p>
<p class="cnM2Yzc1NWViZjc2NjRmODdhYjlhNWVlMDY2YTdlNDVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan’s heart pounded as he set the report down, picking out another. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3Zjg4NWYyYmZlNDQ1ZWJiOTFiOTZhZTg5NThiNmQ1"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">… The trapped seagull squawked as we exposed it to the Mist. No doubt it would have flown away if it could. There was a gust of wind, disturbing the Mist or blowing more in from nearby…</span></em></p>
<p class="cnM1OGI2NmM3ZjcxYjQ4OTJiOTkxYzhkMjc5Y2EyMzdh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan leaned back, triumph blossoming in his chest. “Mammals. Reptiles. Birds. It’s consistent. In the moments before Mist Mutation, the victim begins emitting the Mist. But why? What happens in that moment?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYWE3ODVmMWJmNDRhYzNiNjBiNDBlMmZjN2I0OWEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">His fingers itched - if only he could simply </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">be there </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">at that moment of transition, to vivisect the animal and observe the effects directly, then surely, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">surely </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">there would be a clue. But it was impossible - he’d have to expose himself to the Mist to be that close. And all dissection of Mistwarped animals had found nothing useful so far. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3MDA5YzViZGMyYjQzOTVhOGJmYTFhM2MyZDg1Nzg5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Unless… </span></p>
<p class="cnM3YWEzYjA5ZmJiMjQxYmE5MWY0N2Q0Y2JjZDJjODM3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan froze in place, cutting off a traitorous, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">forbidden </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">thought. But it was no use. The idea had struck him, and the pieces came together in his head. “If someone else noticed this… if it’s taking place at </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">that </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">moment… then… no. It can’t be. But it makes too much sense…!” </span></p><span class="cmUxYmVmMGZjYWVkZjRmNzViNjVlNjFiNGUzNTU5YzMw"><br/>Support the author by searching for the original publication of this novel.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNjNzQyYzEwODQwMDQ0NDVhMmViOWVjN2U5YjVjYWVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sir? Are you alright?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZWE3OTk2NmNiYjQ1OGZhZjdkN2VkZTE3ZmJlYjIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan blinked, realizing that he was breathing heavily, gripping the desk in front of him far too tightly. “I… I’m fine. Thank you, Luke.” He took a deep, shuddering breath. “Got another fetch request for you, actually.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM1MGM2ZmY2YjBlZjRlMjk4YmQ5ZmEwZjMwZmRhZGNm"><span style="font-weight: 400">The boy grinned, his missing tooth prominent. “Absolutely, sir! What can I get for you?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5YmVhNWRiYTEwMTRmOGM5ZjhlNzUwZjY4ZGViMmFl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is going to sound weird, I know, but… can you tell me if any researchers are doing work on or around gravesites?”</span></p>
<hr/>
<p class="cnM5OWE2M2JkYTYyMDQwMjhiYjIwMGNiYzkzYzc0Y2Jk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Francine d’Vert was having an absolutely amazing time. There was so much to do and see here in Airspire! </span></p>
<p class="cnNlYzBhNjllYTRhMjQ3N2VhZmI2Y2U5OTljNzY5MDg0"><span style="font-weight: 400">She’d already arranged for new supplies to be delivered that evening to Stonewing. There was no telling when they’d end up leaving, so it was best to have that knocked out sooner rather than later. But after that, she’d gone exploring. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwYWE1YjU0M2YwYzRjZjA5YTE0ZmJjODcwZTg5MDJj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Being the central hub of development for Zephyria meant that Airspire had a number of tourist attractions. For example, there was an enormous building kept isolated from the general populace, but it was entirely made of tempered glass! Apparently it was a “greenhouse” that allowed for plants to grow all year, no matter the season. There were even special magic lights that simulated sunlight when the daylight hours grew short! How astonishing! </span></p>
<p class="cnM4MWMzOTdjNTI1ZjQxMWViYzk0YmY5NmJjYWFlODJk"><span style="font-weight: 400">And even more important, it might completely solve some of Geova’s underground food farming problem! </span></p>
<p class="cnMzOTY5YTVkNWYyMTQwMGViM2ViODQ0MTIyZGMwYzQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Frankie excitedly asked a ton of questions to the guide, hoping to maybe replicate the structure back home… but unfortunately, the guide didn’t know very much. That was okay; she was gonna go talk to the Council of Winds and see if she could get a blueprint or something. Maeryn wasn’t the only one who could talk to the ones in charge, after all. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhZmY4ZTExODE0MjQ3YjNhMTE2NDlmMzczNDZhY2Iy"><span style="font-weight: 400">But before all that boring stuff, there was a lot more city to explore. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjhjNjBhZmU0NjQxMGU4OTFmMTMwNWIwZGZhODQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400">After spending a delightful hour in a building that simulated falling through the air with what they called a “flight suit” and a marvel of steam engineering that propelled air upwards from vents in the ground, Frankie decided to ask about airship research.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OGVhYzY3MjNjNTQyNTFhNjczMDA5YWZmNjkxNDQ0"><span style="font-weight: 400">It had been a perfectly reasonable question! She had no idea why the tour guide had paled and stammered when she asked. Maybe she’d gotten too close? Come to think of it, having her face only a few inches away from theirs might have been pretty rude… oh well! </span></p>
<p class="cnM4M2ZmMGZjNGM1NTRhNTNiZjcxNjlkOWVkZTk5NWZl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, the guide had pointed her in the right direction, and Frankie felt like she’d made some kind of religious journey. Right in front of her was an open-air building where at least a dozen engineers - wearing similar clothes to her, in fact - were visibly diagramming, creating small-scale models, or actively tinkering with an airship right there and then. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3MzFiOWVkOWZjYjRjMjNiMjk4MjcxMGZlNTAyMDcx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey guys! Can I join in?” Frankie asked, holding her breath. She hadn’t had much luck connecting with other engineers back in Geova - they hadn’t really understood her passion for vehicles. But maybe things would be different here? </span></p>
<p class="cnMyMzBmZGNkZmRhNzQ4MzI4NDcyM2M1NWFjMmM4ZWRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure, why not? I could use another pair of eyes on this. Let’s see what you got.” One of the guys sketching a diagram cheerfully waved her over. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmNzJlOTMwNmNlZTQwODhhYTU0NDQyY2UwZDJiZjM3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Frankie almost bounced over, joy filling every step and leaving her feeling like she could fly without any wings of her own as she hurried to see what he was working on. It was so nice to find people like her! Airspire was officially her new favorite place. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyMWQyMzZkZmVlNTRkNGM4MzY5YTA3ZWI4MzRjZjNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides home of course. But maybe when everything was over and the stupid Mist and mana problems were figured out, Frankie could make a smaller, personal airship and come on weekends? Yeah, that sounded fun. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTUzMDFhZGUwOTQzMmJhZmQxMGY0ZWIxMmIyODcx"><span style="font-weight: 400">All too soon, sunset approached, and Frankie reluctantly waved goodbye to her new friends. “I’ll be back!” she promised. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZGIwMTU3Yzc5YTRjYWI5ZjYwMzE1NGUxYjcyNDI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You better!” one of the boys - Frankie thought he was about her age, which was nice - demanded with a grin. Frankie had no idea what his name was, but she’d remember his face for sure. “You’ve given me some good ideas on how to improve the mana efficiency by insulating the steam compartments, and I want to see what you think when I finish reworking the blueprint!” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0NTU5ZDY5YjBhMDRmZTU5ZDgzYTA3NDQ2NDhlZDA4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Franke grinned from ear to ear. “I gotta go meet up with my Captain now, but I should be back in the next few days. Count on it!” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlNjkxMjJiZTJkOTQ4NzNiMjU0MGMzMzMwN2JiYTZk"><span style="font-weight: 400">The boy extended his hand, stained with ink and grease, and Frankie took it without hesitation. It wasn’t as though her hands were any cleaner at that moment. “It’s a promise,” the boy agreed. “See you soon, Frankie!” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiMmYwYzQwNDkyOTRiMTZhOGJlODQzNTE2NGU3Nzk5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“See ya soon.” Frankie turned and hurried away, only realizing half a minute later that she really should have gotten his name before she left. “Oh well. I’ll get it next time. The important part is that I made a friend! Now, I wonder what Rin’s up to?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhOGRiNDk3MjA0NjQzY2I5OTFlMzMxMmVkMjVhOTlj"><span style="font-weight: 400">She picked up the pace. No doubt, Maeryn would have been up to something interesting, and Frankie couldn’t wait to hear about it. </span></p>
<hr/>
<p class="cnNhYmJhYjlmNGM2ZTRiZDlhZWU4MGJmMzhmZTZiYmE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn, Frankie and Dan sat cross-legged on the bed in Maeryn’s room, looking at each other. Dan had insisted on privacy before he would talk about anything, so they’d made their way to the rooms with reasonable soundproofing.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZTJkNTZkZDZkMjRmNTdiZDlmZDMxMmQ3YjBhZmJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You start,” Dan said, shaking his head. “I… I still need to find the right words.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZTJlNGRlMTZhZDRlMzFhMTllMDc5ZmFjMGFmYmEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn and Frankie exchanged glances. “Okay…” Maeryn agreed slowly. “Frankie, do you want to start?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM2OTc3MjE5ZGEzYTQ4YzViMmRmODJiMTYwMWU5YTQ1"><span style="font-weight: 400">The engineer nodded agreeably. “I had a great time exploring the city. Got lots of stuff I want to have another look at, later. There’s a greenhouse for growing stuff year-round, which was pretty neat! And a building that uses air jets to make people feel like they’re falling thousands of feet and help people learn about air currents! Then I found the airship research place and spent the rest of the day there.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNDcxNmU2YzgwMzQxNzY5OWVhMmRiZmY0N2ZmYmYw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn nodded with a smile. That sounded about right for Frankie. “Anything else?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmOWMyMzMxNDQzOTQ4M2Q4NDVkYjQ0YmI2MDAxMDlh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh! I almost forgot!” Frankie left the room for a moment, prompting the captain and alchemist to glance at each other, confused. Then Frankie walked back in, holding something behind her back but wearing a wicked smirk. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjNzgxMGJiMDVjODQyZWI4NWNlOTNlNDQzNDRhNTFl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn had a sneaking suspicion she knew what Frankie was hiding. “No…” she moaned. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZDQ2YjU0YWJjNzQ4MWVhOTcyNTY1MzBmZGQ5OTU5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes!” Frankie whipped her hand around, presenting a tricorn, just like the one that Captain Jenkins had been carrying. Exactly the kind of hat stereotypically worn by pirate captains. Even worse, it was the traditional black, with bronze trimming along the top. Taken by itself, it didn’t look that bad, but Maeryn couldn’t help but stare at it in horror. Had she somehow jinxed the world when she saw Jenkins carrying the stupid thing? “You wanted to know how to convince me to stop calling you a pirate captain? This is my price. Put it on.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5NTBkZTFjNjg3ZjQzMDBiZmUyN2EyNDQ1ZWNlOGU0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn looked at it, then back at Frankie, then back at the hat. “You want me. To wear the hat.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjMmNjNTliMDRhYjQ1M2NiMzEzZTM5ZmM3Njg5MDUz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yep. Not all the time, unless you feel like it, but I want to see you wear it. Right now.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzZDgzNzg5OGM1ZjRhZDA5ZjY1ZDMxYzRhM2I2N2Iy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan chuckled loudly. “Go on, Rin. Unless you fancy being called Pirate Captain Maeryn from now on.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmNDM1Y2E5NjY2NjRkNzg4NmQ2OTFiMDI4ZjQ2Yzhi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn shot a glare at her alchemist, then sighed. “Can’t believe I’m doing this,” she muttered before reluctantly picking up the hat and putting it on. She was most displeased to realize that it was actually fairly comfortable. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyYjk2ZTQ3NWMyNTQ3OWFiNmViMzZjZmJhZDJiNmE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Frankie looked her up and down once, then nodded and gave her a thumbs up. “Perfect. Alright, I’ll drop it for now.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiZTZmNjk1YjI3YzQxMDA4MGEwY2Q2YmEyMjQ4M2Mx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“For now?” Maeryn repeated numbly. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDgwM2QwOWU1YjRlNmZhYmY0ZTAxZTcyMGE5NmZm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You didn’t think I was going to give up this joke forever, did you?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhMjUwNGMzZDg4ZjQ2ZDNhMjFhMDIwYzFlNzQ2MDdh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn groaned, and ripped the hat off her head. “Moving on! My turn to present, then, unless you’re ready to go?” She shot a look at Dan, who shook his head. He looked far better than before after her mild humiliation, but he seemed content to go last. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiNmEwZmM3MWJiNTRlOGY5ZGU2ZWU1ZDgyYWQ2NjI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright then. So, because I kind of expected Dan to not be superhuman at research for some reason, I booked a gig for tomorrow. A quick transport to and from a research site nearby to check on Research Master Graves.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNWMyNjZmYWRiMDQxMzJiOTQ2YWQxNDMwOTNlYmQ2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan twitched, but said nothing. Maeryn paused, looking at him questioningly, but Dan jerkily shook his head, gesturing for her to go on. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyODJhNDA5NzFlZDQ4Y2FhMWFmNjhhZTM2YzdjZTlh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“... Right. Apparently, his assistant Ernesto is worried about him, and is paying us to get him to his master’s research site. Thing is, I did a bit of research on Graves…” Maeryn sighed. “He, well, he apparently got his name by doing most of his research on or around gravesites. Mostly graveyards. For people. Stuff like seeing if the soil in a graveyard has different properties, or trying to measure stuff about mana in graveyards, or… the guy was kind of obsessed, I guess.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM1NmI2YjAzNjdlZDQzMWNiY2MwMWZkYTJiZDE0MGY1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did he find anything interesting?” Frankie asked curiously. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2MGY0NDE2MTM4NjRlNjU5YWVlN2MyZWU3ODkzYmM0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, it sounds like it? Apparently the mana in graveyards does take on a couple of weird properties, but I couldn’t really understand what it meant.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwODcxZGQzNzBkMjRlNTM5OTA3ODkxOWI0Y2UzM2Q4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan took a deep breath and released it slowly. “That’s… that’s quite a coincidence,” he said with a grimace. “Because if I’m right, and I desperately hope that I’m not, Research Master Graves has already figured out where the Mist comes from.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZmE4NmIwMGMxMDQyYmY5YWRkNmYzYWRkN2NmMzZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Dan?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NGYzNTY1MDMwMzQzOWE5YjBlNmFlZGU2YmM0MjQ0"><span style="font-weight: 400">The alchemist ignored Maeryn’s tentative call, eyes wide as he stared down at the blanket beneath him. “I… I think I figured it out, too. But I hope I’m wrong. I have to be wrong. Because if I’m right, then </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">I can’t fix this.</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwYWQxOWY1YjRkMjRhNGFhNzZkMTg5YjAxMWM0MTAw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn’s heart skipped a beat. “What do you mean? What did you figure out?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YTQ2YzliMmY1MDRjNGI4MWRkNTA4OTk2NmQ5MTUz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Spit it out, already,” Frankie encouraged impatiently. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjZmVkMDIwOTVlYjQ3MDliOTBhYjI3MTFhMDBiZjdh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan swallowed. “Maeryn… Frankie… I found the research that gave me the key. Animals that are purposely exposed to Mist Mutation… they generate Mist, briefly. At what I suspect is the moment of death.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5NGVmYjE2NDFiNDQyMDViMjIzMTI4ZDQ0ZjE4ZmVk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay? And?” Frankie asked, not understanding. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDNjYmI5MWMxNDRhMzliNDE2MjlmNjQxNDQ4N2Zj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And the Mist is spreading constantly,” Dan continued. “Which means that if I’m right, that there is an untold amount of death occurring on the surface.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwM2U3MjMxMGZhYzQ1NjQ4NzdlMTNhYWRlYTMxZDdh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“But… that doesn’t make sense,” Maeryn refuted with a frown. “That sort of thing would create an immeasurable amount of carcasses and rotting smell, enough that would ruin the air quality for who knows how far. The Zephyrians would have seen flying carrion-eaters by the hundreds. Depths below, the Geovan hunters would have seen them!” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjMTdjMGFlYmNiYzQzOTg5NGY0NTljMzZiZmFkMmIz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan nodded solemnly. “Unless the death was happening to the same being infinitely. Constantly. Unless the poor creature was caught in that moment between life and death and trapped there.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OTdiNGFjYThiZTRmMDZiMzE1NDM3Yzg3ZGY1YThh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn’s heart leapt into her throat. “You can’t mean…!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYTk2NzFmMzk5YzRlYTVhOTIyNmZhNDYxYWEyODQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. I think we’re dealing with the Undead.” </span></p>
