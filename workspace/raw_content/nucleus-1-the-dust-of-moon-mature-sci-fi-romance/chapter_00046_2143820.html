<p class="cnMyMjJkMTY3ZTk2MjQ5Mzc5OGM1OGFiMWJmNGVlYmM1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><strong>18:30 February 23, 2295</strong></span></p>
<p class="cnNlNGFiODJiMjFlOTQ5ZjNiOWM4MjhlYTA0OWE3MDUz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Cranesong Garden, 1F, Mount Sword Lake Hotel, Zhongshan District, Taipei City, Taiwan, Imperium of Dragons Territory</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YjdkMjkwZDUyNjQzZTA4MzM0MDcxYWMwMzRkMmU2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><span style="font-size: 1.5em"><strong>D</strong></span>ilinur sat across from Prince Joon-Seok Pak, pretending to focus on her rice while stealing glances at him. He was handsome, with snow white countenance, dark wavy hair contrasting against his red and gold embroidered coat. His sharp jawline and intense brown eyes caught her attention most.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5M2NiMWM5NWI0NDQxYzdhYzI4ZmU1NDZlNGQxYjU1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The duck is cooked well. Just the right amount of spice," the Prince commented as he reached for another piece.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYmYzNmM0ZWUxNTRhYjZiM2VmYjBlNDczOTUwN2I2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Indeed, milord," Dilinur fumbled with her chopsticks, struggling to pick up the sticky rice. "Indeed..." she repeated.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NGM4NzVlMmI2ZTQ5NzBhNzk2ODM0NWJmNjVhYjU2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Imperial fusion restaurant was decorated in deep crimson and gold, its opulence only highlighting her awkwardness.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyM2M5N2Q1ZTgxMDQxNTFiNzhjYzcxZDMzOWNiZjQ4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Their table was loaded with abalone in oyster sauce, Peking duck, and lotus root in sweet soy. Dilinur kept eyeing the Dongpo Pork swimming in dark gravy. Food like this was central to Imperial negotiationsâ€”showing wealth through meals as much as words.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmM2ZkMWY4Mjc5ZDQ0NjVhMTQ1NzcwM2Q1N2RhMmVm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You seem to be struggling with those, Prefect Altai," Kaori observed with subtle amusement as she delicately cut a slice of duck. "One might wonder how you rose to such prominence without mastering even the basic tools of Imperial etiquette."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZjE4YjI2MjRhMzQxN2E4ODYyZGE5YTk2Y2VlMTdh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Despite the heat rising to her cheeks, Dilinur kept her face neutral. "Where I grew up, we had other priorities."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YTVlM2JkYzc3NDQyZTJiMGM5NjY5YmI0ZWMwM2Jl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You ask me, world's got bigger problems than which finger goes where on a stick," Iron Roach said through a mouthful of abalone, not looking up. His red sunglasses gleamed in the restaurant's light.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Nzc3OWE2YWU0MjRlZmQ4ZGU4OGY2ODMyMzc4MDk1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Kaori's expression tightened at Roach's bluntness as she ate her duck.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOTEyZDY2NjlhODRmNTM4NTU5ODQxY2M4NDhhNzZi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Prince Joon-Seok took a sip of wine before setting his glass down. "Allow me," he said, reaching across the table.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YWZkYzFiMGY5YzRmZGU4NGY1YzM4M2ZjMzY3NjI2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur froze as his hand closed over hers. His fingers were warm and gentle as he adjusted her grip.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MWYyN2EyZWUzODQ0NTc5YmRhOGQyNjI1ODhlOGEz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She noticed a deactivated Psytum Sword resting next to Joon-Seok's dish.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNmRmMzY5MjExOTQyNzNhNDliNTcxMTJmY2Q5NTdh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Joon-Seok's sword, she thought.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNGZkZTE2MTNlNDQxOTg4OWEyY2I0ZDFlZDY3MzM3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The lower one remains stationary," he explained gently. "It rests here, against your ring finger, providing stability." His thumb brushed her knuckle briefly. "The upper stick moves, controlled by these two fingers."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YmY2YzBjNTkxOTRlZjRiZDZkYmUwN2VkMjU4MGU1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur focused more on his hand than the lesson. The slight callouses on his fingertips from sword training felt pleasant against her skin.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNGE2ODA2NGNjMjRiMzVhOGUyYmFmZDc4Mzg5Yjhl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Now, try," he said, pulling his hand away.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMTdkMDFkYWY3MDQ5ZWFhMjFjOWZiZTVkODA4ZmU2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur steadied herself and tried the motion. The chopsticks closed properly, capturing some rice. A small victory.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZjMxMDdiMTFmMzRjMmViMzJhNDUzMDc5MDUzMzI5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Very good," Joon-Seok nodded with a hint of a smile. "Adaptability serves you well. A quality most valued in the Imperium." He returned to his meal, picking up a piece of lotus root.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMWY5MTY2MmFjOTRlOTZiMmY2NGI2YmQ5ZGU0MTUz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Kaori watched with narrowed eyes, her posture stiffening. "How...instructive of you, Your Highness."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNzRkOWJlNzQ0YjRmYzZhOTNkNzI2YmNkNTg5MTFl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Iron Roach snorted, reaching for more abalone. "Should we talk about why we're here? The Crystal isn't going to extract itself." His mechanical fingers drummed impatiently on the tablecloth.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NTZlNzg0YzAzNTQzNzRhMDczYTk0NDUxYTM2OWRm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur looked at the hologram floating above the table. Osram rotated slowly, showing detailed surface features. Thin lines etched across the image, mapping routes over craters and valleys, all converging toward a point deep within the moon's core.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NThkNjVmMjlmZTRhOTk4YjE1NWE0ZWExMDc2YWM4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The image centered on a crystalline structure: the Moondust Crystal, shimmering with prismatic light.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMjJjNGMzNjZhMjQwMmViM2M3ZGI0MTUyNTUwYjU2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"This Crystal must be housed in one of the ancient Neptunian Vaults," Joon-Seok said as the hologram's light reflected in his eyes. "Besides the Radi-Mons, they are the only culture which can construct networks deep into a moon."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMDlmZmM3OWYwNzQ0NTZiNjZlYjllYWFmODE2YjE0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Never seen a Neptunian myself," Roach said, grabbing his wine glass with metal fingers. "What do they look like? Ugly blue octopi? Scantily dressed, sexy ladies?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNhODY3ZGQ5OWI5YTQyZTg5YWM5NjIwYWU4MjBiMDk2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Roach." Dilinur frowned.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYjMyMmJmMGE1YjQwNTVhZDI4ZDg1ODAwNGE2MDcx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Just kidding, Dinu," Roach said before gulping his wine.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMGMyN2UxOGVhMTQ1MDdhZGQ1Yzk4MzA5MTg4Y2Fm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"No human has," Joon-Seok replied patiently before finishing his lotus root. "The civilization is thought to have gone extinct millions of years ago. Earlier this century, the Imperial Legion discovered numerous ruins on Neptune's moons. Scientists named this civilization accordingly."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YzJkNGVjMjgzYjRmZWZhNjMzNTExNDQ1MzhmZGZl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"That explains why no one lives there," Kaori pouted between bites of pork. "I would never want to live close to dead alien ruins."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZmVkMGQ3ZjIxYzRmNTM4MjhhYjhjNTIxMTRkNTNk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"We'd likely be venturing into an ancient dungeon, then," Dilinur said, pointing at the hologram. "These tunnels appear to form a defensive network."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MGYyOWYxNjIzNDQyYzU4ODNkYTBlZjQwMDBlY2I1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Quite so," Joon-Seok nodded. "And that presents both challenge and opportunity."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZTVlNTJiZTBiOTQ3MTZhNzIxNGJmMThhZDFmZTUy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur leaned forward, forgetting her earlier embarrassment. "The Terra Alliance will have analysts studying the same pathways. If they've identified the Crystal's location as well, we'll likely encounter resistance."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYTVlN2Y1NTU3NDRkNDRiMGJiMDhhNDM4MTg3ZTA5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Let them come," Kaori said coldly, taking a bite of abalone. "More glory for us when we tear them to pieces."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMTA3YTk3ZDJlMzRkMjI4Yzk1MTE2YjlmZTU3ZmFi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Roach set down his empty glass with a thud. "Alliance, Directorate, Sand Lotus...doesn't </span><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">matter. We'll crush whoever stands in our way." He poured himself more wine.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZGYzZDdkMTgwNTQ1M2NhY2NlMGMwOWU3ZGY0Nzky"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Speaking of the Directorate," Joon-Seok remarked, swirling his wine, "our intelligence suggests they've become increasingly active on the moon. Their Kimaris Warband has been reported on the Far Side."</span></p><span class="cmRiYWVjYTBiYTkyNDRkYzQ5NzQ4M2RlNzI5Y2IxNTQ1"><br/>You could be reading stolen content. Head to the original site for the genuine story.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM5YzYxYTU1ZDU1OTQ0MmU5ZmRlNWRlZTUyNzY2OTJm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Kaori's expression darkened. "The Maridians have become quite a nuisance. But their technology is primitive compared to ours."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMjIyMGIwMGNiZDQwNzVhMWY5OGJkODA2MWZkNTI2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yet effective in its own way," Dilinur pointed out as she successfully picked up some abalone. "Their Scarab mechs have proven formidable in several recent engagements."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYzVjNWExYzhhYzQ2NTdiZjE5YjIyNGVkNDI1NTEx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Aren't those just bad copies of Digital Era cartoons?" Kaori dismissed with a shrug. "My Draconic Engine could blast them to dust in one shot." She sipped her wine and dabbed her lips.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDk0YWZjYmEzNjRlNThiYmU0MzE0OThhY2EwMWM4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Their leader, Kofi Mensah, is no fool, either," Joon-Seok countered with a tone of respect. "His administration has secured significant influence on Jovian moons where both Alliance and Imperium have failed to impress the locals."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYTM4MmI0MGU1ZDRjYjhhNmYyMzBmZDBlZWFlMjcx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Roach laughed harshly. "Bah, look at us, talking about jobs on a fucking Saturday night!" He speared more pork with a chopstick, ignoring Kaori's grimace.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhODU0ZGNlZmFiMjQxMDA4YjNkNTk4M2RhYzZiNTM1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Roach, watch your manners!" Dilinur glanced at Joon-Seok. "At least show enough courtesy to let our visitor finish his thought."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ODc2NzhhY2Y0ZDRlYzdiOWFjMjczZmU4M2Y3Mjc3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yet Sir Roach has a point. Very well." Joon-Seok grinned as he picked up a piece of duck. "Do you each have some form of indulgence? Any recreational pursuit you find pleasurable?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYjQ5YTRiYjBmYTQyYjZiZjVkODVjYWE4MDYxODc4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I go to Osram and browse the antiques at Yue Shanghai," Kaori answered, adjusting her hairpin. "There's a jade toad figurine I've been eager to add to my collection. Proposed 2 million Imperium Yuan to purchase it, but the seller insisted it wasn't for sale."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOTdiNDVjMWU3OTRjODlhZWNmNzFiMDllYmM5MDU5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur suppressed a groan, envious of Kaori's wealth. "What a...covetable dilemma to face."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNDQwM2EyNDVlYjQ5MzhiYmM4ZDBhMzc0NzlhMTcz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Indeed," Joon-Seok said, giving Dilinur an approving look. "I prefer the fitness center, personally. There's something peculiarly relaxing about tearing down old muscle tissue and having fresh ones develop."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NzFhNjhmYWU0OTQyNmU4ODY4MDk0MTMxNWNiMTQw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I can imagine so," Dilinur felt herself blushing as she glanced at Joon-Seok's physique.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MDk0MTRiMzQyZDQ0MTJhNDRkODJmZmE0NTdjMjdi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"So you what, hit on the girls at the gym? One night stands?" Roach leaned forward, wine on his breath. "That still trendy these days?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YjRiN2I2MDY2OTQ0MmY5OGE4ZTJjZjlhMjM0MDEx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Kaori covered her forehead with her hand and scoffed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNDc3ZmE1ZjBlYzQzYzdhYThkNDYyZTkzODMzM2Jm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"One of these days we need to have Cheng teach you proper speech, Roach." Dilinur shook her head.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMDZjNWRhYWE1NjQzN2ZhMTU1MzI0YjkxMjhhNGQw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Too late," Roach grinned. "Fuck! That reminds me. Cheng still owes me seven thousand Yuans."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwODQ3ZjdhYjAwYzQ3ZDk4MGQwNzIwN2Y4NjI5YWFj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"For?" Dinu's eyes narrowed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMjQxNzA5OWI5ZjQyM2VhNWQ2ZTI0MDM1OGI0YzU0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"For a bet!" Roach pointed at her. "You still haven't found a boyfriend, Dinu. Cheng said you'd agree to a date with him BY JANUARY!" He laughed loudly. "Thanks for making me rich."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNzhkZTE2NDYxMzRkNmViODJkYmEzZjU0YzRjZGIx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"â€¦you're quite welcome," Dilinur replied dryly.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZjY2YjU0MmIzMzQzYzhiNWQ0OTM1NzMzNjcwMmU5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Your Royal Highness, when we reach the Moondust Crystal, how would we extract it?" Kaori asked, changing the subject.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZmQwN2YwN2Q4OTQzMGFhYTNiNDc4Mzg2MGZhZDJi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I have a few Peons at my disposal if you need them," Roach added, scooping up some lotus root with his spoon. "Best indentured servants on this side of Earth."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMTQ1MTE1Mzg1MjQxNTE5Yjc3YzI5ZTc5NmE2NjBk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Five Peons should suffice," Joon-Seok agreed, taking a sip of wine. "But the Terra Alliance and their Psi Lynx agents will undoubtedly be at the vault door. We may need an extra set of hands to secure our dominance."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1N2EzN2U0NWVmMzRmZTdhNmQxM2M5YTQ4YWY5ZGZk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"What extra hands might you be referring to?" Dilinur asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MjFiYTI4ZTI1MDQ2OTU5MWQwNzYxYTYyOTkxMDI1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You call him Flesh Pot," Joon-Seok's voice remained smooth. "Governor Qin's reports indicate he's ready for deployment but requires Helionite consumption to be fully awakened. I've procured a cart full of Helionite. With his strength, we can overcome any opposition and secure the Moondust Crystal."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MGNiNGRmZmFiYjQ0MTM4MzFmNmFlZWNhZDI2ZmY5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur studied Joon-Seok's face for signs of doubt. There were none. She nodded, feeling the weight of the mission.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMjE3ZDA5YzRlZjRjYWJhOTY2ODNiOGM4ZmZmNWY2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"If you prefer, Prince Joon-Seok," she said evenly, "I may show you to his Tissue Culture Container after this meal."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MjkzM2MwY2FhMTQyY2JiNDJhOWE1NWJlMTdmYjAy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"That would be best," he nodded.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YTNiZmU0MTJlZjQ2ZWViNGZmYzU2ODgyY2U4MTg0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Just then, Dilinur's stomach growled loudly. Her cheeks flushed as everyone stared at her. She looked away, hiding in the shadows of her robe.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMDA1ODg3ZjlkYjRmYTViNGE3ZTNiNTBiMWRmYWM3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You have not eaten any of the main dishes," Joon-Seok observed neutrally. "Is the food not to your liking?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MmJiMGQyM2VlODQ2YTJiYzVhNWEzNTIwNzA3ZDY4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Before she could answer, Kaori smiled coldly. "Perhaps our selection is too...sophisticated for certain palates."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYzUwODg1ODVhZDQxOThiMGE0NmYwODc1NzJkODUx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Surprisingly, Roach broke the tension by waving down a waiter.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOWI0ZWRiOTRkNzRkMGRiNTIzYmM0NTNkYmQxZmMx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Get us some decent food here!" he barked. "Lamb skewers, and uh, Kash-something. Kashgar stuffed flatbreads! Turpan grape leaf dolmas."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MTg5Y2JkODQxOTQyMmU4NTQ1OWMzZjg4YjUzMTRh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The waiter looked confused.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjhkMTg1MjEyMTQzNDA4ZjQyMWI2MDFlMGJlMjFj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Got Helionite in your ears?" Roach frowned.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjA5ODAzZjI4YzRkYmE5NmUyOTI0YTMwYWI1ZGUz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I am most sincerely sorry, sir. Would you mindâ€¦" the waiter bowed.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDFmNTZiZjE5YjRmNzk5Yzc3NTliZTk1ODhmZjRj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Uyghur section," Roach clarified firmly. "Forgot which page it was on your fancy menu. Triple portions, all of them!"</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MTRjOGY0ZDc1NjQwYzhhY2Q4MThiZTcwMGU0OGE0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur stared at him, surprised.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxODUyZDZiMzJlNzRmNjU5ZTUxZjgzYWJkMzhmYTNm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"What?" Roach shrugged. "Spent three years stationed on the Western Border. Best damn food I've ever had. Criminal those Unblooded dishes aren't on more menus."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTQ5ZjFmNjZmNjQ1ZWJhYjRmZjY3NzAzMDc0YWVh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"How...quaint," Kaori murmured, setting down her chopsticks. "I heard those foods are eaten with bare hands."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZDBhOTg3N2E2MTQ5YTBiYzNjMzMxODJlMDIxOTBi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Best way to enjoy real food," Roach insisted. "Taste gets in your skin that way. Stays with you."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MjNkM2UzZWRmODQxZTNiOWFhYjkwZGVmZDJjZjJk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The dishes arrived quickly, their rich aromas mixing with the refined Imperial cuisine. Dilinur felt a wave of homesickness. The skewers were perfectly charred, the flatbreads stuffed with spiced meats and vegetables, and the dolmas carefully wrapped.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZjg4NjNiMjVhNTRiZTJiOTk1MDk2M2Y0ZWEzNDIw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Show us," Joon-Seok said, focusing on Dilinur. "The proper way to enjoy these."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMjBiZjMwYjE1ZTQzYmNiMTRiZTMzYjE1N2JhN2E2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur demonstrated how to eat the lamb from the skewer using teeth and fingers. The familiar motion reminded her of her childhood.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OGQyMWE5ZTk4MTQ4NTNiOTk1ZGYxYWJlZDI4NGZh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Like this," she said, passing a skewer to Joon-Seok.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxODM3MjMyYTk3ZDRlM2VhYjk3ODRkNmQ1MTllZmRl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">To her surprise, he followed her example gracefully. When he bit into the lamb, he closed his eyes momentarily in appreciation.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZjZmMWZiNmY0ZjRkMjA4NDA4YWMyZGU2YmNhNGRj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Remarkable," he said, opening his eyes to meet hers. "The flavors are bold, unapologetic. Our Imperium has much to learn."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4Y2I2YTg2N2UxODQ0OWJhNzZmNTMxNzllNGIwM2M2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Pardon?" she asked, her heart skipping as she admired his features.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OTc3MjgyY2I5OTRkMDNhZDViMGIzMzBjMjM0NWIx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"About embracing diverse culinary traditions," he replied between bites.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MGI0MDNjN2EwNDQ4OTlhNjE4N2U0MTYzZjIwZWEy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Roach was already on his second skewer. Kaori held her skewer at arm's length, examining it like a specimen before taking a cautious bite. Her eyes widened slightly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Mjc3YTcxNmQwMTQ0Yzc4ZTU1ZTIzZDMxNmVjZjQz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The spice blend is quiteâ€¦distinctive," she finally said.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Nzg5YTQ4ZGU3NTQ1MDc4YjNmMzUxYzhkMzlhNzdl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"It's called 'ziran,'" Dilinur explained, feeling validated. "A mixture of cumin, red pepper, salt, and other spices passed down through generations."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkN2Y5YWRiM2VkYTRhN2RhZWY0M2Q4ZWE4YTEyZWMy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The heat builds gradually," Joon-Seok observed, reaching for a flatbread. "Complex rather than overwhelming. A thoughtful balance."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZGZmNmU0M2NiZTQ0NTU5Y2NlNGRjZGJlMjNhODg2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">They ate in comfortable silence for several minutes, the earlier tension fading. Dilinur watched Joon-Seok's expressions as he tried each dish, noting his genuine appreciation.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NmZiMTRkNzVkYTRjZDBhMzVjNTFjNmMyYWE3Y2M1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As they finished, Joon-Seok turned to Kaori and Roach. "Lady Ouyang, Sir Roach. It has been a pleasure dining with you both. I believe Prefect Altai and I have some logistical matters to discuss."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTUzNzQwZDE3ODRjYjJhMmFjZWYxYzNiNTcxZjE4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Getting tired of us already?" Roach raised an eyebrow, but looked relieved.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYzZmMmYxOGQxNDRlZDk5NGI4ZTdmMWI2Nzk4MTk3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"What are our orders, Prince Pak?" Kaori maintained her composure despite the obvious dismissal.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZDgxNDU5NDdiYzQyMjU5MDQ0OGUwMzgwYjUxODBh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Await my instructions tomorrow. I need to discuss some operational details with Prefect Altai," Joon-Seok replied politely but firmly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMGZhNzE4MjUzODRjOWRhMzAyOGFiMmFhNWMyNmMy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Kaori stood and bowed deeply before leaving precisely. Roach simply got up and left without ceremony.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNWUzMmU4MzFmNjRlODZiMWEzZjJmMzI0ZjM2Yzc5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As their footsteps faded, Joon-Seok turned his full attention to Dilinur, his eyes reflecting the subdued lighting.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMTNhZmZlNzgwZDRkZjc5Yjk1NWU5ZTU1MTcyOTc3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"After dinner, perhaps a stroll?" he suggested, his tone hinting at something beyond professional courtesy. "Then we may inspect this Flesh Pot you've been cultivating."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OTcxZWU2ODMzODRhNDViYzRmODMxY2EwMTY3MDdj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">For once amid the shadows of Imperial politics, Dilinur found herself intrigued by what might lie behind those composed features. "That would be most welcome, Your Highness."</span></p>
