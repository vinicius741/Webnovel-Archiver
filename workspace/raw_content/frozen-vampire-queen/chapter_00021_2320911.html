<p align="left" class="cnM3MmE0NGExYmVjZTQwMDliZjE1NWM1YTI1NmU1ZmY1">Emma watched Karlack flip onto a low branch of a tall tree. Without wasting any time, the maid girl launched her whip around Emma in a surprising gesture.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNhODRjYThhZmUwYjRiNDA4MDBiNTRiNGMwMGEyZGM0">The whip clenched around Emma’s waist, and the vampire was hoisted onto the branch with ease, and it didn’t stop there.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM0ZDYzMTQ5OTYxNzQyMWFiODlmMDYyYzZkMDU0ODFh">“Wait!”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNhYWE2NTM2NTMwOTQ2ODJiZGFkNzMxODE3Y2E4ZjRi">Karlack didn’t wait, she leapt to branches even higher, separating herself from the ground below, and dragging Emma along with her. When she reached the highest point of the tree, only then did she release Emma onto a thick branch.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM0OGU0MGU4NDU4OTQ0ZDU4Y2M0MGU1YmY5Zjk1MWMz">From this height, the duo could see the large stampeding mamoths even better. Their vibrant colors created a vivid sea like a moving painting. When they reached the treeline, trees began toppling over, and the ground rumbled fiercely. Even the tree they were on shook violently, but it wouldn’t fall over—a testament to its structural integrity.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNlYWNlY2QyNjQyMDRhMzI4MjY2Y2NhY2VkYTdiZjk3">Karlack’s eyes narrowed at the sight below, and she grinned deviously. Her nature had completely changed when she became a combatant. The previously docile looking girl had taken on a sheen of bestial hunger. The previous shine of her sword form was now a vivid glint of anticipation in her eyes.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNhZmJlYjMzYTllZTQ2NGZhZDZlM2E3MDIxMmJhOWM4">“What do you plan to do?” Emma asked.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM4NTEzYzFkMjU2MjRiZjc4NWI3Nzc4YzAzOTNjZmYx">Several mammoths had already passed beneath them, and they were already getting to the end of the herd.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMxMzBkZDkwMDA0MzQ0NWZhMTJmY2UzOWY0NjE2N2Yz">“For a thing such as this,” Karlack said, readying her whip, “I believe the key is to take on the slowest one.” She channeled magic into her weapon, and it elongated, becoming the largest whip Emma had ever seen. Karlack grunted as it hooked around the last mammoth’s tusk.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNjOTUwODhiZjc5OTRlNGY5MTFjOTIyN2RmZjUwNzIw">She leapt from the tree like a cartoon figure, jumping ahead of the last mammoth. Karlack swung down incredibly far, and the whip shrank at the same time, until she was right beneath the tusk.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNiZWM2Y2IxMzJlOTQ1NDJhNmU1M2Q3M2MxZGYxZmQ4">The incredible tension built from the huge amount of kinetic energy didn’t snap the whip. As Karlack swung underneath the tusk, the whip somehow won out over the mammoth’s weight.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMwZGI1YzJlOTRmMDRmY2E5MjdjN2Q0MmNiZWI1ZmRk">Emma watched as the mammoth slid forward and fell hard onto its front knees. The collapse brought the creature straight onto its tusks, but by then, Karlack had already slid under the creature’s belly and her whip slid cleanly off.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMzYjBiYTA2MDY3ZTRmNjE5MjM4OGMyYThmNmFiNGI1">Karlack jumped onto the creature’s back and ran up its body towards its head. When Karlack reached the back of the mammoth’s neck, she snapped her whip around the beast’s throat.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM1YjgyZjJlNGQzNzQzZDBiN2Q4NjIzMDA1MjA0NTE1">The creature tried to blow on its horn like a trumpet to signal help, but with its throat completely choked by the whip, no sounds emerged.</p><span class="cmI0ZmQwMGRlZWMxNDRiMDE4OGE0NTgyNTg5ZjdiYzZl"><br/>You could be reading stolen content. Head to the original site for the genuine story.<br/></span>
<p align="left" class="cnM2Njk3YWMyYmYzNzQ0ODBhYTJmMTUxNjUwMjY4MzUz">Karlack grabbed hard onto the creature’s tusk, and yanked it up and to the side. A loud snapping sound echoed in the forest. The cracking of the mammoth’s neck heralded its doom.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM0OTFkMjczOGQ4ZTQzMjBiNDJjNWNmOTM5OGVhZWFj">Emma watched with her mouth agape and grabbed onto her own throat. She never expected that Karlack would snap the creatures neck. She wondered how much power those arms contained to be able to achieve such a thing.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM1ZDQ2NTlmZjE0NTQyNDJiYzJkZDk3YmM4NWNlOGI1">“Mistress!” The maid yelled. “It looks like dinner is served!”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNhODZmNzA3YTg5MjQ4ZDY4ZTVkZjA3MWQwYzQxMGQ0">///</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM5OTcwZmNlZmM5YjQ2OTViZWEyZWFkZDE5MTk2YWYw">By the time night descended, the group was all crowded around the kill. Half of the girls were looking strangely at the dead beast, and the other half looked proudly at the kill. And Arrow was a horse. Horses didn’t usually have expressions. Her buggy eyes just stared at the dead creature.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMzODQ1YzI5M2I1YzQ3YmM5ODkwZDVhYzFjMTdkMzNi">Emma and Sora shared the same look. It was as if they were stricken by a huge cultural shock.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNmMmMzYzAwNGZiMjQwYTRhNmQwMjFkODJlZGJjMDc1">“Mistress,” Karlack said, “it has been decided that I will be the one to skin this creature with the assistance of our newest party member.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNhZTk1NDcyM2Y5YTQ1ZmI5NjBmODFjZTg3ZjZjZWI3">Emma stared strangely at the dragon girl. Her heart was like a relentless metronome still. It pounded restlessly in her chest. <em>Maybe if I let her do this, I’ll become disillusioned?</em></p>
<p align="left" class="cnNiZjY0OThlZmQ5ZDRjZmU4ODIwYWMwM2ExNjQ1NzA3"><em> </em>The vampire shrugged, appearing as if nothing about this situation effected her at all. “And what about Sora?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMzMWJmNDliMzVmYzQzM2JhMTBhZGYwNzc1NGVkYWFj">Sora reached up with a shaky hand and grabbed onto Emma’s dress. “There is no need to worry about me at all. It’s not like I’ve not seen sights like this already.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNkMGViOGY2ZjFjMDQxZWNiNmU5MmVkZGFhYjU2NjJl">“Have you ever heard of trauma reinforcement? There is absolutely no way I will let you watch something so gruesome.” Emma took off her coat, covering the top of Sora’s head. “There, this will cover your face like a lamp, and you’re not allowed to peak.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMwYmYzYWM2YzMyYzQ4NGViYWY5NTQ0ZDNmMmZjYzNl">The dragon smiled. “You two have such a good relationship. She would hardly say anything to me earlier. Until...well, I’ll leave that for another time.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNiOGEzMGU0MTdmMzQwZDg4MmY0YzgzNDk4NWYwYWZm">Emma tilted her head, wondering what the dragon was talking about. She watched Karlack walk towards the dragon and grab onto the girl’s hand. “What are you two doing!?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM2ZThjNzNmZDU0ODQ0NTY4NDg4ZTU3OWQ1ZGMzYTc1">“Don’t be jealous, Mistress.” The girl grinned smugly before reverting to her sword form.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMxZjc2ZDdhZWE4ODRjOGQ4YTY5M2Q2N2RiNTk3YzVj">What happened next was the most elegant swordsmanship Emma had ever seen. The dragon wielded the sword gracefully and closed her eyes. Her body moved as if controlled by the best marionette. Each slice was so clean and fast that Emma’s eyes could hardly follow.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMzMDFjYTkzNWVkYjRhZTZhYjYxNGUxYTJlODIzZWUz">The vampire burned the image into her eyes, watching the dragon’s performance. It only took a couple of seconds for all of the pieces of the mammoth’s body to be separated.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM2NzM1ZGQ2MWFhYjRmOWM4MTQ1YTdkMDQ0ZWE2OGQz">Emma was hoping for a display that would leave her retching or something that would distance herself from the dragon, but she could only watch with her mouth hanging open.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMzMjU2NmNmMzA3NDRiZjQ4M2ZmOWU1NGYzYzY2YjYy">The dragon smiled at the vampire, pleased with her performance.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM3ZjcxZDVjMWIyNDRkZGU4OWRmYmZlYWYyNTBlMDg3">Emma did everything to calm her rapid breaths. She looked off into the distance at the trees. She tried to turn her head to the reverted Karlack, but the evil dragon had already descended upon her.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM5MDNhMTc1ZDQwMzQ1ZDRhZmRlNjI5MjU5MTc3MTgx">The horned woman touched Emma’s cheek with the back of her hand. Lunaria knelt in front of Emma and grabbed onto her chin with two of her fingers. She forced Emma’s blue eyes to stare into her own. The dragon had found her own prey...Her own princess to capture.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNmN2Y2YWE5OTEyNDRlYTI5OGNhNTZlZDcxY2Y2Yzli">Lunaria leaned forwards and pecked Emma’s lips with her own.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNlOTlhOWNjNzQyZTQyZWVhM2YzOTJiMzEzNzk0M2Ey">The soft contact was instant and fleeting. Emma found herself puckering her own lips involuntarily, but just as soon as it came it was over.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM5OGQ2MWRlOWRiMTQ1NWI4MDY2OTQ4MjQxNWM4OWEz">Sora burst out of her lampshade and glared daggers at the two. “You can’t hide me like this just so you can go kissing on each other! It’s indecent!”</p>
