<p class="cnM5NWNiZDI5ZGQyODRjNzBiNjk5NGFkNTI1MjM0MTM0" style="margin-bottom: 0">Crouched in a tree, I held a spear in my hand and waited. My usual robes, bodysuit, and armor were gone—replaced with clothes that barely fit. Things I had shamelessly stolen from either camp, or from the occasional Flesh Raider scout I’d run across in my weeks long test.</p>

A stolen black long sleeve shirt from one of the human scientists, that had looked very stretchy and interesting on her curves but which hung off my form, and was currently smeared with mud in a striped pattern. A bundle of… <em>some kind of leather I didn’t question too closely</em><span style="font-style: normal"> I had taken off a Flesh Raider and was using as a cloak, that I’d taken some time to add moss to and turn into a makeshift ghillie suit.</span></p>

Or not available, rather. They were back in camp, safely locked away in my quarters, to my annoyance. All I’d been allowed by the Mandos on security duty was a combat knife, per Jaster’s orders by holo for this little exercise. I’d had to improvise everything else.</span></p>

When I’d asked how he knew I wouldn’t use it anyway, he’d simply grinned and answered, “You won’t. Too stubborn. Too prideful.

<p class="cnM5ZDlmOGNiY2MxOTRiZDVhM2E3MDM5MDg4NjNmNzk4" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal">Thirdly, the Mando security force—at least, those not occupied with other duties—were to act as OpFor. He turned the damn verd’goten into a training exercise for his men by pitting them against me. </span><span style="font-style: normal">I argued if that were the case, then I should be allowed to attack the outpost and steal resources, and he had agreed, because it kept the men on their toes.</span></p>

<p class="cnM0ZjY3MTdjYzY4YzQ0MzE4ZjAxMmYwZmVmOTdlZWI4" style="margin-bottom: 0">Finally, the time limit and the final test. I was to stay out for at least two weeks on my own. Before the end of that two weeks was up, I had to hunt down some dangerous, nasty critter and provide proof I’d taken it down.</p>
<p class="cnMxYjFmMjNhNmM0ZTQzYmE5YmZhNzI4M2RmNzZmZmJh" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnMyYzRjNjJiZjBhZjQxZTNhMDQyMjAyNmI5NTJmNWRi" style="margin-bottom: 0">A limb cracked below and I focused my senses on the surrounding area. The wind carried with it a faint, musky scent of a predator and the stink of rotting meat—growing stronger by the second. I felt something hungry nearby, on the prowl for the delicious scent of girl-flesh as it followed the trail I’d left for it, right towards where I was hiding.</p>
<p class="cnNjZmU5NmFlZjdmYTRkZWE5NGQ4MjRmMjQ0Y2FhNDUz" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnMzNjlmNTNiY2JmZjRkMTI5MWI2M2Q2ZWY4YjgzOWI0" style="margin-bottom: 0">I felt the vibration of very large footsteps through my feet and readied my spear. My breathing slowed and I watched the forest floor below me.</p>
<p class="cnM0Zjc0NzIzMGM3ZTRhMDBhOTlhOWUzYTkyMTk1YmI2" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnNjNzJiOTNiNmY3ZDRmM2Q5MDRlNDllODMyZjcxY2Zk" style="margin-bottom: 0">After a few moments, a very large form lumbered into view. Nine feet tall. A solid wall of muscle, with big teeth, claws, and anger issues.</p>
<p class="cnM0NzkzM2JmODhiNTQyMjRiYjQwNzE1ZDg3YjU4MGJl" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnNhNjBiNjZkOTJhNTRlYzJiNWFmZDJiMDFmZTBkNjAy" style="margin-bottom: 0">I hadn’t been terribly surprised to learn that there were rancor on Tython. They were on practically every planet that could support them, thanks to the Sith, smugglers, pirates, and other idiots moving them around. I had been a bit annoyed to find tracks so close to our camp, but apparently it had just enough intelligence to see the wall and flood lights at night, and all of the Mandos during the day, and decide it would rather go after easier prey.</p>
<p class="cnMyYjZkMzdmNWZlNjQ4MzdhYmY2MWRhOTBmMzlkMzM0" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnNlNGIwZTRiMTM0MjQwNjJhNGMzNjVkYzJkOTdjOGJi" style="margin-bottom: 0">And now, easier prey was within its reach. It had been stalking me for the last two days, but little did it know, I was luring it close to the camp as I prepared an ambush. I wanted it close enough that when I walked back into camp, I could just send someone out to verify its presence.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZDNiNDhjY2UxYzQwOTdiYWQ5NzA1MzRjYzJjNWQ3" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM1ZTRiYzZjZWMyOTQ0YmNhODQzMTgxOGQ3ZjNjNTcw" style="margin-bottom: 0">It slowed, pausing just before the tree, unsure. It couldn’t <em>see</em><span style="font-style: normal"> the dirt, but it could probably smell that I had been digging here.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNjM0MjQ5OGEyZjQ4NDliNmJhNzg0YjQxOTkxMjRi" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnNkMTNjYjc5MDA0ZDRlZTNiZDg2N2ExYjBkMjM3MTZi" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">Finally, the temptation of a delicious meal won out and it stepped forward—right into the first of my traps. The pitfall collapsed as soon as it put enough weight on it and the rancor fell straight into a hole that was roughly knee deep on it and filled with spikes, the ends of which had been hardened with fire like my spear. It let out a roar of pain and rage and started trying to get out, but it was too late.</p>
<p class="cnNiZjMwM2M0NWY5MzQ3MTJhMTFjYjUzY2JjOTlmZjI1" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM3MTM0OTg0NzllNzQxODViNzg4NjYyZjEyODE3MWU5" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal">My knife flicked out and cut two vines. Rocks fell, dragging vines with them and propelling a pair of swinging spiked log traps </span><em>much</em><span style="font-style: normal"> faster than they would have gone if they had simply fallen. The two spiked logs slammed into the beast from the front and back, spikes penetrating its thick hide and silencing its cries as they </span><span style="font-style: normal">sandwiched it between them and</span><span style="font-style: normal"> punctured its lungs.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYjViNDhlNWViMDQzYjc5OTlkZWJkZDc1Mjg0MGU1" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnNiYWFjOGZiNjAxMDQwNzhhNGMwNjVjMjRmYjE2NWU5" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">It wasn’t dead yet and, given the rancor’s natural regeneration, it was possible for it to shrug this off with time. I wasn’t going to give it that time.</p>
<p class="cnM0OWM0ZWJmYWIzYTQyYTNhMGVkNzZkNGY2OWMzMjVh" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnMzMDZmZWVlZjg2YTQyNjViNWM1MWFhMTMwYWUyMGI1" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">Jumping off the branch, I grabbed a vine and swung down, taking aim before letting go. I fell, driving my entire weight behind the spear as I aimed for one of its eyes from above. The spear went in with a wet sound, then a crunch of bone. The rancor jerked, before going still. I felt the life leave it as it died.</p>
<p class="cnMxODZiNDU1ZDY0NTQ3ZDI5MGRjOTQ4MTRjNTlkYWU2" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnNjM2NiMzQ5M2FhNzQxYzhhMDQ4YzJjN2VhYTEzYzcw" style="margin-bottom: 0">Hopping off the rancor and safely away from my traps, I took a moment to use my knife to collect a claw as proof. Wiping my knife off, I made my way out of the forest, to the hundred yards of cleared ground of no man’s land around the camp—something the Mandos had done after I used the surrounding trees to slip into the camp and evade our security.</p>
<p class="cnM1YjYzMmY2MTVjZjQ1Mzk5MmNjM2ZmZGZlMjYwMzU4" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM1MTcyNWQ4NDNiMjQzODU5YWU3MWE0NTk5MjFkZmFj" style="margin-bottom: 0">I was met at the gate by a one of the Mandos on duty. I could feel his amusement as I handed him the claw and pointed. “There’s a dead rancor in a pit trap half a mile away. I assume that takes care of the trial?”</p>
<p class="cnNkMmJlMmRhODU2ODQwZGRiMzU0MGE2NzVlN2IyYTE0" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnMyYWU1NjI2MzMxZDQzN2I4OTJlY2JhOTU3ODgwODVl" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Let me send someone out to verify it, then I’ll make the call to Jaster. But yeah, that should do it.” Chuckling, he reached out and laid a hand on my shoulder. “Good job. Come by the chow hall tonight and we can toast to it.”</p>
<p class="cnNjODY3NjdhOWVjMTQ4YzU5NTIxMmI1NjUxZDAyMWIy" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM4YjIxMWM3MDAyODRmMDE5ZTcxN2ZiYTEyMTllOTUy" style="margin-bottom: 0">I nodded, before gesturing for him to follow. “Gladly. As long as it’s not that <em>degreaser swill</em><span style="font-style: normal"> you all enjoy.”</span></p>

<p class="cnMyNWZlN2MxMTVkNjQxMjJiOGZjZDk2MmQ0MDc1ODBl" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal">An irritated sound escaped my throat, before I sighed. “I can’t enter my quarters like this. I need </span><em>someone</em><span style="font-style: normal"> to hose me down before I even consider heading into the fresher, and then bring me a change of clothes. Please.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZjU5YmY1ZDE4YTQ3OTZiZDA1YjAwNzc4OGM2MTVm" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnNjM2M5MzUzNDIyNDQ0NGU4MDQ1N2JlMDRlYjQwZDQw" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal">I pulled off the leather cloak, allowing him to take in my appearance as I stopped beside the area we used to hose down certain samples, or fresh meat. I was covered head to toe in </span><span style="font-style: normal">mostly dried </span><span style="font-style: normal">mud and leaves. I’d needed to hide my </span><em>highly visible</em><span style="font-style: normal"> white hair in a way that guaranteed that even if I had to move at speed and the cloak fell off, it wouldn’t give me away. Likewise, my red skin stood out too much, so I’d made a little impromptu camouflage the same as I had with my shirt and pants. </span><span style="font-style: normal">And despite bathing in the river when I could, I hadn’t had access to soap, so I stank.</span></p>

<p class="cnNiZjVjMTQ3OTkzZjQyNzhiODU5Y2I1MjdkMTk3OGNh" style="margin-bottom: 0">Arthree whistled a single, low to high note as he looked out the transparisteel cockpit. I nodded. “That’s big,” I agreed, bringing the <em>Rusted Silver</em><span style="font-style: normal"> in closer as I ascended </span><span style="font-style: normal">and began to circle the massive stone pillar. Vines covered almost its entire surface, except where waterfalls cut grooves down its sides from the top—the spray creating a cloud layer around it, cutting off the view of the top from the surface.</span></p>

The airlock controls inside worked just fine, so I closed the exterior door and went through the simple process of purging the atmosphere and opening the inner door—using the Force and imprinted echoes on the panel to guide my actions. </span><span style="font-style: normal">I turned on the floodlights on my helmet as the interior doors slid open.</span></p>

Arthree beeped over the open channel between us and sent a power readout to my suit’s HUD. Apparently, the moment we crossed the threshold, some system within the pyramidal ship had shut off coinciding with the call in the Force going quiet.</p>

They don’t all feel the same.</em><span style="font-style: normal"> Thinking on it in fact, and carefully listening to my senses, only one other source of that call in the Force felt nearly identical. That didn’t account for all of what I was feeling though, so it stood to reason that there was perhaps one other ship like this one, and the other </span><span style="font-style: normal">calls in the Force</span><span style="font-style: normal"> were all different things.</span></p>

<p class="cnM1Zjg2YWQ1M2Q2NjQyZWVhNzgxOTMyYzVmYjViZTZk" style="margin-bottom: 0">Arthree moved beside me as we made our way through the ship, which quickly became apparent that it had either been or been turned into some sort of temple-ship, given the remains of structures we found everywhere—planters and desiccated trees, what may have once been offering bowls, and other things. I even found a surprisingly intact set of smooth, stone beads that had apparently once been part of something like a set of prayer beads—not just strong in the force, but each bead alternating between light and dark. The string holding them was broken, but I collected the beads in my bag for later—I could use them as a meditation aid, which felt like their intended purpose.</p>

<p class="cnMwOWQ3ZjIzYjM0YTQyYTZhYmFiZDI2MGE0Y2FkZmVi" style="margin-bottom: 0">Eventually, I reached the largest central room in the ship that wasn’t devoted to the thing’s power system. I felt a faint response in the Force and Arthree beeped and hurried ahead. I picked up the pace, catching up quickly as I panned my suit’s floodlights around the room. It was empty, save for the remains of potted trees, offering bowls, and what might have been prayer mats but which turned to dust underfoot as I walked. Sitting in the center of the room, on what I would best describe as a circular dais, was a holocron. Like the ship, it was an octahedral balanced perfectly on its tip where it had seemingly sat for millennia.</p>

<p class="cnNiY2E2YTU1Mjc5MjQ3ZjY4MGQ4OTg3ZGY3NmQ5NDAw" style="margin-bottom: 0">Moving closer, my suit’s lights showed it to be alternating black and white, with no apparent seams, and roughly the size of a softball. Reaching out, I carefully picked it up. I felt the holocron pulse faintly in the Force, then again, stronger as it registered my presence. Then, came the uncomfortably familiar feeling of something touching my mind.</p>

It was very much like having a computer connected directly to my brain, through the Force. I could <em>see</em><span style="font-style: normal"> words and images—all in Basic. Closing my eyes to better focus on it, I realized this holocron didn’t have a gatekeeper or some sort of AI interface, but an actual indirect neural interface.</span></p>

I blinked as the warm liquid hit my tongue.

We were exploring one of the old, ruined temples and found what we thought was a garden. These vines were all over the place.

So we’ve been trying them out different ways. Chewing, chopping and mixing with food, drying out and doing the same, one of the guys even rolled some up and smoked them.”</span></p>

Finally, however, the stalemate broke. The projection’s appearance shifted. He was still human, just a different man. Rather plain looking, with his brown hair swept back, a beard, and a somewhat tired expression.</p>

The next fired and I reached out and grabbed the bolt, forcing it to twist through the air and strike the first drone, freezing it in place for five seconds as it registered the hit and was temporarily ‘killed,’ before it would start firing again, slightly faster and at higher intensity.</p>

Whipping out my hand, I used telekinesis to push it away with a burst of slightly less Force than I’d absorbed from the bolt.</p>

I’d submitted my holocom number since I wanted to keep abreast of any news coming out of the Temple and anything important going on that was unclassified information but unlikely to be highlighted in any of the news broadcasts coming out of the major media outlets—that is, things the Jedi would make sure their own people knew, but which the bigwigs in the Republic might not want publicly known.</p>
