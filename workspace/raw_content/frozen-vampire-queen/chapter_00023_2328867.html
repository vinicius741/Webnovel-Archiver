<p align="left" class="cnMyZDUzNmRiYzRiNTQwNGJhOGU5ZTdiZDI1YzIyZTFm">Emma’s cheeks became red as she remembered what happened the night before. As the sun cast its harmful rays overhead, the throbbing inside of her returned. It seemed that the effect of dragon’s blood was not a permanent one.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNkZTgyNTAyYzlhMTQxZGE4ZDgwYWQ2MDQ5ZWVkNzY5">Lunaria seemed to notice her condition as she held onto Emma’s other hand—the one not bound by the little girl, Sora. “You can’t really go into a town looking like this.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMyNjNkM2FkNThmZjQxMzc5OGQ4ZjljOWUzNzA4NmFl">“Is it bad?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMzZWRkYWZlNmU0OTQ2NmM5MmUyMjE5NWFjMTBhNGZm">“It seems that some of your paleness returned. I didn’t expect the change to be so pronounced, but...I guess this means you need to take another bite.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNiZWFjNDNmNjg2OTQ0ODU5ZWZmMDUzZTVlMWNjZTQ3">Emma felt her face flushing, but the sword on her hip seemed to spark in agreement.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNmODQ2ZDY3YTBkODRmOWU4YTVkYmRlYjE1NjUwMWJi"><em>“</em><em>I want to walk around like all of you. Besides, as you are now, I can’t really call you mistress.”</em></p>
<p align="left" class="cnNhOGU5ZmY5MWFiMDQ1ODFhMTlkNjZjZDhhZmM4YmNh"><em> </em>Emma frowned at the sword. “Is it only when I’m full of dragon blood that you will act obedient?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNjODcxNjY5N2NmODRmNzlhYTEzNDMyM2Q1YWQzNGJj"><em>“What do you mean? I’m always obedient…”</em></p>
<p align="left" class="cnMzNjc0MThiM2M0MDRjNTQ5MDViZWQ0ZWMxZDhkZTFm"><em> </em>Before she could further voice anymore dissension, the dragon girl stood in front of her. Emma stared into the gorgeous face of the woman in front of her, becoming increasingly embarrassed and self conscious. The idea that Emma would be worried about how she looked herself only seemed to surface in these moments. The vampire found that the longer she stared at Lunaria, the more she couldn’t bring herself to bite into the girl’s neck.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM0MjA3MzIwNzJiOTRkNDc5ZGVmMzRmODNjMWVlN2Fl">An attempt to look away was thwarted by the dragon. Lunaria grasped onto both of Emma’s cheeks with her hands and pulled Emma towards her neck. “Go on, consider this a normal activity among married couples.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMyMTc3YWEyZDYwYjQ0MzE4YzA0MGM1NGViNWRhODgy"><em>What part of this is normal married couple activity!? </em>Emma struggled as the sickly sweet scent attacked her. The vampire’s fangs quivered with need. The urge became something irresistible.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNhNGQzZDI2NTU1ZTQyMmVhNWFhNWVhMDNiNGIwM2Y1">Emma acted on instinct, and her instincts told her to stick out her tongue. She licked the dragon’s neck as the sounds of a little girl protesting faded into the background. Emma’s fangs took a bite of the sweet apple dangling in front of her.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM1ZjMxY2EzOThlNzQxNGU4ZWQ4YWYzY2Q5Y2I1NDhh">The vampire’s two sharp teeth were like a viper’s. They struck quickly and efficiently. Emma hardly registered the squirming of the dragon in her grasp. She wrapped her arms around the sweet prey and sucked greedily. As soon as the intimate moment came, it ended. After finally realizing what she was doing, Emma snapped to awareness, and pulled away from her prey reluctantly.</p><span class="cmY5OTY1MzM0YTg2ZTRmZDQ4NmExOGMzZjNlMjFmYWQ0"><br/>If you spot this tale on Amazon, know that it has been stolen. Report the violation.<br/></span>
<p align="left" class="cnMzYzg0ZTUwYjFlMDRkNTE4Y2VhYTc5ZWJlNmI2N2U3">Emma licked her lips as her eyes glowed sharper. The faculties of her reason slowly came back to her, and she realized that Sora was banging the side of her fist against the vampire.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMyZmI5YjY5Y2M4YTRlOTZhMTY1NGNmNGYwMjkxZGU1">“You’re insufferable! You can’t perform such lewd acts in front of me! I forbid it!”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNhNTY1NGRmNzliODQzNjFiMWZlODJiZjk2MmE3ODA1">Emma’s face heated as she looked between the little girl and the dragon. The latter one was grinning stupidly.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNhMzAxMjQ2NjFlYjRhMWI4OGE1YjYyYWU3Yzg1Y2Jk">The dragon smiled and clasped Emma’s hand. “I would have let you continue, but you should really do things like that in a room. I didn’t expect my wife to be so forward and lick me.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMyY2ZmZTQyYWFlMjQ1Njc4ODFkNTNlNWJjZTA0NTM2">Emma released both of the girl’s hands and pouted, continuing on ahead of them. Luckily for her, she quickly found the object of their search. After going over a few hills, a gigantic city stood in the distance.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM3MzRmNDlkZDZhYjQ1MTNiODdmYWVlMTVmMTk2ZDNh">The vampire’s eyes widened. She had never expected to see a place so large. It covered the horizon from end to end it seemed, and thousands of people moved in the distance like little ants. The rolling hills gave way to fields, and farmers worked their lands.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM3MjcyNzBmOTNiYTQ2YjA4NGM2MTQyYTI0YTY5ZGY1">Oddly enough, Emma could see some of those same Mammoths from earlier. Only, these ones were tamed and being used in the fields. Behind them, she could glimpse tools being pulled like plows rolling over the land.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNlZmRjNjRiYTAzYzRjODVhOWQ3NWQyNjU5OGUyYzFk">Those weren’t the only strange creatures. Large birds prowled over the land like gigantic eagle sentries.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM5MDRiOTRiYjY3MjQwYWNhYjg4ZjFmZTdlZjM0MTc0">The large stone walls of the city had enormous banners hanging down. The were black and rectangular, triangular at the end. In the center of those there was the insignia of a bright orange sun. It reminded Emma of children’s drawings of suns in her past life.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM4MDFmNGQyMjhlMDQ5OTY5MmUyZDA1MzE4N2ViNmI2">Lunaria spoke suddenly, startling Emma. “One of the 4 cities of the Dawn.” The dragon sighed and placed a hand on Emma’s shoulder. “I would have liked for us to simply have some fun, but some caution is advised here.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNjNjQ2NjIwZDEwNTRkN2Q4N2E0NTQzY2ZjYWUzMTM5">“Caution? Aren’t you strong enough to blow this whole place away?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNiNDVkYTE3ODMzZjRiMzI4MTllNTUzZjM0MjM1Mjli">The dragon chuckled. “That may be so, but I’m not the only of my kind, and there are many things that can come close in this world. For example…” Lunaria looked at Emma meaningfully but stopped herself. “Anyway, I prefer not fighting if I can help it. If I use my magic as the dragon of the moon, some are bound to know it was me.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM1ZjQ3N2YyYTUxYzRhZjU5YThhNTY4ZDZjNjY0MmZh">Sora grabbed onto Emma’s hand tightly. “You will be fine if you take care of yourself. You tend to go overboard if I’m not watching you.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNiN2JiZjdjNDRhNTRiNmVhMjViMjg3MTBhNmIwNDE2">Emma sighed and poked Sora’s nose. “You’re not my mother. It’s supposed to be the other way around…” Realizing what she said, Emma frowned. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to…”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM2ZDIwZTY5ZTBlYzRmNjM4Mzg3YzMwMzE1MGEzNmE2">The little girl hugged on tightly to Emma’s side and shook her head. “It’s okay. I understand how you feel, and I want to feel the same way.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMxZjg2M2FkMmY2OTRlMWJhMTQyYzRkMTAyMGE0NzRi">“You ‘want’ to feel the same way?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM1Y2Q3NTRkZjhiMTRlNDdhNWZkNDczYzA5MGQxZTVi">“Yes, so you better start acting as a mother would.” The little girl grinned mischievously.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMyN2RkYWU1OGQzNDRiYjc5MDI2M2Y5NTY5OWZkYWE1">Emma could only smile at the little girl’s antics as she finally called forth Karlack. She summoned the maid, and the battle maiden bowed before her. “You will take care of cleaning up all of my messes. From now on, you will be informally instructed on the ways of maids.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNjMTY0OTAxNThkODQ0MDJhODM3Zjg1MDAzYzlhYWI1">“Informally instructed?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMyYjA4NWY4MTUzMzRlNGViZDk1M2Y4ZTFjOTM0NmE1">“Yes, I cannot teach one how to act as a maid, so you must learn yourself. Which means...There’s got to be maids in the city, right?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNjYTQ4ZmFjYjU4MDRmYTE5NWM2M2FlN2EzMmUyNzBj">Lunaria snorted. “Of course there are maids in the city. You will find all grades of nobles here, shy of a king.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNiMDk2OTU1ZTUyYTRiZTBhMmIyZDhmNWFjMmJkNzFl">Emma smiled and looked back at her new maid. “Perfect, Karlack will be in charge of her own maid education. The rest...Well, I’ll figure it out as I go!”</p>
