<p class="cnNkZGNjMzRmMzE5YzQzY2VhNGE1NmZlNWJmZjZiN2Vl"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">The bathroom smelled god-awful. It was impossible to completely block the connection to the septic ditch, given the more than obsolete fittings. And since they'd closed the door and left a small power crystal to provide some illumination, Tristessa had no choice but to breathe through her mouth and do her best to ignore the fetid atmosphere.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZjA4MTA0ZjI1MzQ1ZTM5MGZlZjYzOTdhNzFiMWQ4"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Naked and shivering, she sat on a large wooden basin, her legs braced against her chest, hugging them to keep some warmth. She understood that Tiara had forced her into the freezing water to "cool down" her hysteria.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTE4NjJlYmVmMjQ4MDdhNjViYzhjNzNiNzg5MWNh"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">After all, she'd made quite a scene in the atrium.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYmEyZTI0ZjU5YjQ2YTI5ZDJkMTQzMWQ0MGNhNTBk"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“<em>But I didn't do it on purpose... I came back from Death, again</em>.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZjUxNjNkM2VlYTQxYzlhMTU2OWNjODE2N2UwZDgw"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Thinking of that phrase, Tristessa looked down to see her Baptism in Ruins, beating under her skin like a second heart made of black ice.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MjI2YWQ2YzY2ZDRkODE5ZjQ3Mjc0MjU0YjBjMzU2"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“<em>Every time I die, will I return to that moment in the atrium? Am I trapped in an endless loop? And this mark... The <span style="color: rgba(224, 62, 45, 1)"><strong>[Baptism in Ruins]</strong></span> keeps getting bigger...</em>” Thinking about that, a terrifying thought popped into her head. “<em>Do I have a limit? What if this mark is the way to show that the time will come when I can't return?</em>”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NDFlNTIxNDhhNzQxZDJhOTczN2M0ZTQ3MTA4ZTQy"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Truly, thinking about dying and returning was something she would never get used to. The pain of Death was something no human being should experience, and yet, this was the third time for her.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NmZiZTI1OWYyYzRmZWQ4NWUxZTgxOWYzY2RkOTcw"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Luckily, Severus made sure it was done quickly…</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMjQ3YmI0MmJiZDRkYTk4YzI3MDNkZDc2NGI5NjIx"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“<em>Severus… He doesn't know me now. He doesn't know who I am…</em>” That woeful, tearing feeling of solitude broke both her heart and soul alike in an instant. She couldn’t avoid the tears from falling, thinking of that blood elf, him sleeping in her lap, his smile full of confidence, the warmth of his hug, his kindness and selflessness in helping her... All lost forever. “F-fuck…Fuck! My god, it hurts so fucking much…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYzdlNGI0MDM2NTRjYWJhYTZhY2Q0NDQxZDBjY2I4"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Her heart could not tolerate such a twist of fate. Nothing would ever be the same, not even if she met him again under some other circumstance.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZjQyNWU3ZTNiMjQ3YTk4ZTg3MTE3ZWNkYzg0YTI3"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">What assured her that she would find Severus again in the Sea of ​​Trees, right on time to save her from those vargs seconds away from devouring her and Jin?</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMmY1NTdjZWM1YTQ4ZmRhZWNkNjZkNjczOWY3Zjc1"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">What assured her that all the events of the world, even the flapping of the wings of a bird crossing the Dominion from end to end, would not result in unpredictable changes in the future?</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYzQ5YjNlNDJjOTRiNDlhYjA5MjNmMzU5NTU3NDNm"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Vel’Moran, the God of Chaos, was the architect of such phenomena. Cold, heartless and apathetic… The god who watched over her through his servants, Endrel and Margules.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZTZiMTg0OWVlZDRiYjA4MGE3NmE3MmQ4NjIwNzYy"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Over her every Death, her every Rebirth, her every Resurrection.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZGFiNDM1YzdiMzQ1YmNiMzcwMTg1N2E3YWNlN2M4"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">The past was erased from everyone, but herself. She was cursed to remember every lost relationship, every happy moment fading into nothingness, every tragedy and calamity, a warning of every imminent disaster…</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNDJjNDk0ZTNlMDRjYzQ4OTRmMDJjZWJlMWI0NzAx"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“<em>Severus… If he comes here, he'll arrive the day of the Coven's attack! He will…die…</em>”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4Y2NhNTRlMzJhNDQxMzU5OTE1OTBlNWEzNTRlODQz"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">And not only that: everyone in that house had a noose around their necks at that moment. It was only a matter of time before their executioners arrived to trigger the gallows: the witches had said so, whispering among themselves, admitting that the attack had been planned on the day of the <em>dimensional shift event</em>… Or, Tristessa recognized, also known as the Evil Dream.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NjUxY2Q4NDNmODRlNmU4MWJjMWUwN2I3YzdmODRi"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“<em>They said a certain Lord had predicted it… A Book of Sin, a book of forbidden knowledge. <span style="color: rgba(224, 62, 45, 1)"><strong>[An inescapable future]</strong></span></em>,” she thought, chewing on frustration with every second she spent pondering what action to take. “<em>The attack is going to happen; the Mercer-Archeos family have to know. But how? How can I tell them that I returned from Death and watched them all die at the hands of the Coven?</em>”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZDM0MjYwOTliZTRkOWQ5MzY0MzkxYmU4NGMzZDMy"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Tiara and Lucahn had seen a girl who had lost her temper, not someone who had returned from the future with information critical to their survival. She had a lot to explain to them, and she had to explain it with care and intelligence if she didn't want to screw up and complicate the situation even more.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YTZmY2M0YjEyMjRkYTY5NzZjYzkzNDJhYjQ3MWEz"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">And time ticked on, unstoppable for her or anyone else. From that moment on, Tristessa had six days to do something that would help reverse the dire fate that awaited them.</span></p><span class="cmNlNmFkMDAyNDVmZDQxZTFiY2NlN2IzZmUyZTg1ODlm"><br/>The narrative has been taken without permission. Report any sightings.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM0N2ZmNzlkZGFkYzQzMzhhYmRlMjY1MDgwYjczYjFj"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Six days to save Jin, Lucahn, Severus... And that woman who had just entered the bathroom.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NDhiYWFhZDQwNzQwNmVhMTZjNmU1NWEzMDhmZTMw"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Mrs. Tiara... <em>Eeek</em>!” Tristessa looked over her shoulder and looked down right away, her face burning as she caught a fleeting glimpse of the naked housekeeper.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMjZhNWMyZjgwNDRmZTM5NzRhNDI5M2VkMDdkODQ4"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“What a silly reaction. You have nothing to be ashamed of when you see a naked woman.” The girl listened to Tiara placing towels and utensils on the small table, and then the sound of water splashing before feeling the cold touch of the woman's fingers against her hair. “I'll help you clean up.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZDY0NmM3ZmMwMjRhNmY4NzNhMWUyZjY1NTU4Y2E4"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">"W-what?! There’s no need!" she said quickly, letting out a shriek.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOWVhN2JjYzQ4ZDRjYTE5NDM1ZTBiZWQxZWVlZWIx"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“I say it is necessary, and if I say so, then there’s nothing you can do to avoid it. So shut your mouth and let me clean your hair. And calm down, will you?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYzA2YTdjNzEwZjQ0YTdiZTMxYzgzNjViNTE0Yzll"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“I'm sorry... I'll try,” Tristessa whispered, though there was no way she could manage it.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYWZjZGFkN2JhMzRmYjg4ZThkNTc0Y2E1OTQ1M2Iw"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">She was abnormally nervous, feeling Tiara's fingers caressing her dirty, greasy, black waterfall of hair and rubbing the skin on her shivering back. Then the woman moved on to cleaning her back with a wet towel, causing the emotions surrounding her heart to increase at a critical level. There was something about that action that didn't leave her calm, and left a painful emptiness in her chest.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNTFmZjY0ZTMxMjRlNGI5Mzg1YTliYjljYzhiZjE3"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">As if the mere touch was slowly killing her.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NmQwYTFhZDBiMjRlODFiMjEzYzI2N2UwYjYzZTEw"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“<em>I don't feel well... What's wrong with me? Why...?</em>” she thought, her soul suffocating with a new kind of fear hidden in the darkness, with no intention of showing itself but taking the air from her lungs and covering her eyes with fresh tears. “<em>What is this fear…?</em>”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNGRkZGY0NDgwOTQ3ZGVhMzU2YWYwMDE4ZGQ2ODQ2"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Tell me, what was that you said about the Coven?” Tiara asked her after finishing cleaning her back and breaking all physical contact. The terror that gripped her soul eased, and Tristessa breathed more calmly, even daring to spy out of the corner of her eye and see the woman beginning to clean herself. “It's not something you can just say out loud without any repercussion. Explain yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNzkyZjJiZjU0ZTRlZDBhNjRmNWU1YWEzMjcwMWY3"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">It was the moment of truth. Or at least a truth sustained by a narrative she had to fabricate at that very moment. If only she'd had a little more time… But no one did, not with Death looming over all.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYzNmY2Y1NDVmNTRhYmJiMDc5ZTkyZWM2MmI2MzQy"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“I was…kidnapped by the Coven. And I escaped from the refuge they have in the woods. I don't remember how it happened… I don't remember anything about my life, before I woke up in that camp full of crazy women.” Lies, more and more lies, but told with enough confidence to appear real, with a grain of truth mixed into the story. Truth about the horror she'd witnessed in the invaded house. “There were people being skinned, c-children being…being…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNDIyOTAzZDcwZTRiOTc5MjA5MDZhMWE4YmFkYzk1"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">She thought of Lucahn, and that same bathroom she was sitting in now. Of Tiara and her unborn child. That diabolical image of that hooded witch, destroying and desecrating their bodies… The ghosts of the past threatened to return, to haunt her, forcing her to squeeze her eyes shut.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MWQ1ZTUyZjhlNDQ5NDM5NjZiMGFmY2M0MjZjMmVl"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“I-I can’t…” she muttered, tormented and earning Tiara’s sympathy.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMzVhMWYyZmY5MzQyMTFiMjhlOGQxMzkxOTExODE5"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“You can leave that out. But go on, tell me more about what you heard, about your escape.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYjQwOWFkNzFjYTQzNjNhYmI1MGRhZDZkYmRjMzAw"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“I-I only remember a witch talking about some Lord…Lord Moebius, I think. And a Book of Sin.” As she said those key words, she heard the pregnant woman gasp. A positive sign for her story, perhaps. “She said the book spoke of an inevitable future. About the Evil Dream, and that on the day of that event, they would attack this house. In six days. Yes, in six days, all of them will come to…to shed the tears of the innocent.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZWVhYWVlZDU5NDQxOGI4NTJiOWI0YjM1ZjFiYmVm"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">The witch's song, echoing inside the bathroom in the nonexistent past, echoed inside Tristessa's head, creating a crack in the already fragile stability of her mind.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMjMzZTBmNjI1ODQ1YmE4YTJjZTAyMGE2ZjQ3NmU1"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Fear filled her, the truth now more important than the narrative, and that was what scared her most: that what she said in the end was true, and it was now up to Tiara to believe her or not. It depended on that woman, who was maintaining a meditative and disturbing silence, second by second.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NTA5MDc3ZTJhNzQ3M2ZhYzJhNzBkMThmMmRhZjBk"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“I see...” she said, finally. “You brought very bad news to this house, girl. But I thank you, for giving us the opportunity to prepare for the day to come.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDIwMmI2YmJkYTQyYzNhYjYzNDg2MjA1NWJmMDA5"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Tristessa felt insects scratching her throat, and a suffocating heat, upon hearing such a response.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZmU1MDRjNmE3YjRiNzM4YWI1MGZiMzQ3NDk5ZjVm"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Prepare?! Are you crazy?!” she asked, almost shouting, intending to turn around to see if Tiara had truly lost her mind. “Didn't you hear when I told you they're coming to kill you all?! You must run for your lives…!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NzI0NGEwYzMzMDQ4NTQ4NTBhM2Q4MmMxNTVkZWUx"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Just as she turned her head, an arm crossed in front of her neck and pulled her back. Tristessa was thrown from the basin, and another hand locked her left arm behind her back. Then her attacker's legs encircled her waist, completely immobilizing her.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MGZhNWE2NDliZTRiY2Y5NmYwYjY5YTkxZWFjNTY5"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Careful with my baby, you little bitch,” she heard Tiara hiss against her ear, sending chilling tickles as her windpipe was completely blocked, impeding the flow of oxygen.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MWEzYTQ1Yjg2ZjQwZGM5N2RmZTQwMWY5MGVhM2Nk"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Ugh! Ah…! T-T…Tia…!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YzgyNTc0YzlhMTQwODVhNmFlNmFhN2FmOWI5MzMz"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Don't fight it. Let it happen. It will be worse for you if you resist.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZjAxYWNiYzUyNTQ2YTBhOWJhNmIyYzE4YzU3ODM1"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Desperation and adrenaline erupted in the girl's body, as she correctly sensed the danger she was in. She struggled to free herself, twisting as much as she could and straining with her arms.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZDZiMGJhMDFkMDRjN2ViODU2OTViMThmMThmMzll"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">But Tiara held her in a martial arts lock and Tristessa's strength drained at a quick pace. Her head and lungs screamed for air, and, unable to meet the demand, she began to lose consciousness.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NWY5MjI0YjhhNjQ5NjhiOTU1ZjZjNmI3ZTcwY2Qw"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Do you know what they teach us in military service, girl? To distrust mysterious benefactors like you. They usually turn out to be con-artists, or worse, spies...” Tiara told her, as cold as expected of her. “We'll talk again. Now, sleep.”</span></p>
