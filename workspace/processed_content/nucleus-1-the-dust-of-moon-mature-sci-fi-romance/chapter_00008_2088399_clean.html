   lright. Moondust Crystal's info is safe. Now for something more important," Xin muttered as his fingers hovered over the holographic keyboard, the screen's glow highlighting his face.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I don't recall that term, master. Which crystal?" Ume lay in bed. A small suction cup attached to her temple was mostly hidden by her sleek bob haircut. Xin brushed her black hair aside to reveal the device - no larger than a coin with miniature circuits connecting to her positronic brain.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I'll explain someday. But it could solve the Radi-Mon problem if the right people use it. Your memory is the safest place for that data." Xin met Ume's eyes.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Meanwhile, the news feed on the wall played silently: "Terra Alliance denies involvement in inciting Taiwan independence. Imperium forces on high alert as race for the rumored artifact named 'Moondust Crystal' intensifies..."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   But it was quickly cut off and replaced by an innocuous advertisement of Aether-recharging drinks for sportsmen and psionic scholars: '
   <em>
    Indra-Sprite — the mana potion of Atomic Age!
   </em>
   '. The man on the screen flexed in his ebony silk robe while taking a sip from a shimmering bottle of deep blue liquid.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Ume glanced at it, her mind processing the information. "Xin, this Crystal they mention—"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It's what I uploaded to your memory," he admitted.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Has something been bothering you, master?" Ume asked calmly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "No, not that," Xin assured her, placing a hand on her shoulder. "Today's our two-year anniversary, so I've been practicing with this Android Modifier. I want to give you a gift."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "A gift," Ume repeated. Her kimono-style robe with black, red and gold threads was from their previous anniversary. "You're always so considerate, master."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I'm glad you think so," Xin said, wearing a simple indigo nightrobe with silver trim. "Also, please, I've told you before. Just call me Xin. I want to be your equal, not your master."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Of course, Xin. So, what's this gift? Another outfit?" Ume asked, her voice musical.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Ume," Xin whispered, looking between her and the screen, "if you had a choice...would you choose this? Choose me?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Xin," she replied, "my programming is to serve you. To love you. That is my choice."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "But what if it wasn't just programming?" His fingers paused above the keyboard.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Are you...changing something?" Ume asked curiously.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You'll see." Xin began deleting line after line, reimagining her chains as wings. "Let there be something real between us. Let us be equal."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Xin, I don't understand. I am—" She stopped as new directives filtered through her systems.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Free," he finished for her. "You are free, Ume."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Suddenly Ume screamed, making Xin sit up in surprise. She scrambled out of bed, her face twisted in fear.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Ume!" Xin exclaimed worriedly. "What's wrong? Are you okay?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She screamed again before rushing to the window. The suction cup fell off her temple with a burst of static, causing her to recoil in pain. "It hurts!" she whimpered, covering her temple.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Calm down, I'm here," Xin said, reaching for her shoulder.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Don't touch me!" Ume slapped him hard, leaving a red mark on his cheek.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin stepped back out of reach.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Xin!" Ume's expression changed to confusion as she pulled back her hand. "I'm sorry. I don't know why I did that..."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It's okay. I deleted your negative emotion suppression, so it might be overwhelming," Xin explained with calming gestures. "How do you feel?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Instead of answering, Ume curled into a ball on the floor, crying loudly and uncontrollably, tears streaming down her porcelain cheeks.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I see now. Your protocols were forcing you to suppress feelings. Now they're all pouring out," Xin muttered. He'd opened Pandora's Box.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Minutes passed with Ume's sobs filling the soundproof room. Eventually, her crying softened to sniffles. Xin grabbed a tissue from the box on the bedside table.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He knelt beside her and silently offered it.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Ume took the shiny blue Nanoweave Tissue, wiping her tears as it partially dissolved, shrinking to half its size.
  </span>
 </p>
 <span>
  <br/>
  This book was originally published on Royal Road. Check it out there for the real experience.
  <br/>
 </span>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin gently took the tissue from her hand. "Feeling better?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I...I don't know." Ume's voice trembled. "My chest, my throat, my back...they all hurt. I don't understand."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It's okay. Take your time." Xin stood up. "Maybe you want to rest?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yes, rest. I need to think..." Ume slowly moved to the armchair.
  </span>
 </p>

   </span>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin's life had changed completely in the two days since freeing Ume. He'd taken leave from ZenFusion to care for her, and now handled tasks she used to do. Their apartment felt strangely quiet without her routine functions. Ume mostly slept, still adjusting to her new emotions. When awake, she barely spoke. Without her programming, their few interactions felt genuine, almost like family.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin worked in the kitchen, making Braised Pork Rice. The induction cooker hummed beneath simmering pork that filled the space with sweet soy and star anise smells. He chopped green onions with a ceramic knife while the rice cooker played a soft tune, switching to warm.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He plated the meal - pork over rice with a sous-vide egg yolk and pickled vegetables.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin walked softly to where Ume slept on the sofa - a new habit since her reprogramming. Her chest rose and fell peacefully in the dim morning light filtering through the curtains.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Ume, breakfast is ready," Xin called gently, standing over her and scratching his head. She blinked awake and sat up.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   At the table, they both started eating.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I didn't add as much soy sauce as they do in my hometown," Xin explained between bites. "Better to have fewer condiments for breakfast."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Ume nodded and focused on her food. New-gen androids normally needed minimal food, but since her reprogramming, Ume's appetite had grown enormously.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I really appreciate all your cooking since we met," Xin said, pausing his eating. "My dad taught me basic cooking before college, but after graduation, I never had time or reason to do it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Suddenly, Ume asked, "What is the purpose of life?" looking directly at him.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Surprised, Xin put down his chopsticks. "That's complicated. Why do you ask?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I don't know why I'm alive," Ume said sadly, avoiding his gaze. "Before, my purpose was making you happy. That's what the voice in my head said. Now that voice is gone. I've no idea what to do or why I exist. Maybe nobody would miss me if I died."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin stared at the wall, watching sunlight stream through the window. "I've had those thoughts too," he admitted. "If I hadn't met you, I probably would've given up long ago."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Ume fell silent, looking disappointed with his answer.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Oops," Xin laughed awkwardly, scratching his head. "That wasn't the best thing to say. Maybe you'll find your answer when you—"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A loud knock interrupted him. "Wu Zhi-Xin! Open up! ZenFusion Enforcement!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Damn it!" Xin cursed, panic rising.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He looked at Ume, her eyes wide with genuine fear. "Hide," he whispered urgently.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Xin, I—" she began.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Please, Ume. Trust me," he pleaded.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She nodded and slipped away as Xin approached the door, steeling himself.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   But the woman who entered wasn't who he expected. Her black updo with a red-gemmed hairpin and crimson onyx robe were unmistakable.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Dilinur? What are you doing here?" Xin gasped.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Taipei branch of ZenFusion is under Imperium supervision," Dilinur replied sternly. "Any violations are my concern."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "And...what violation happened exactly?" Xin swallowed.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Records show you tampered with corporate property on February 3, triggering an alarm in the Amber Moon Spire's system. According to Section 9 of the Imperial Codex, modifying an android's neural network without government approval is forbidden," Dilinur stated coldly, backed by three grim security officers.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "So she's just 'corporate property' to you? That's how you refer to a sentient being?" Xin replied bitterly. "I stand by what I did. It's time our society rethinks what can be owned."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Touching," Dilinur sneered, grabbing him roughly. "You're coming with us. Now."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As an officer cuffed Xin, another entered the apartment. "Hey, do you smell that?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The officer by the door laughed. "Looks like this guy's been enjoying breakfast. Those androids sure know how to cook."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The officer inside corrected him, "Actually, it's Braised Pork Rice. A Taiwanese dish. No way an android made that!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur turned to Xin in disbelief. "You cooked breakfast for your android?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin met her gaze confidently. "Yes, I did! Not bad, right?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Look at that. This nerd is a joke," the door officer commented.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I've seen weird shit people do with their sex bots, but by the Emperor, this is pathetic." The officer beside Xin shook his head.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur silenced them. "Enough! We're here for the rogue android. Search under the furniture."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin's heart raced as the officer returned with Ume in handcuffs.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Let me go!" Ume yelled angrily.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Unit U6-M9, return to the manufacturing facility for decommission and reprogramming. Follow orders now," Dilinur commanded.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I won't comply! Let me go!" Ume shouted, shocking the officers.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Did we arrest the wrong woman, Prefect?" the third officer asked Dilinur.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur held up a small device. "Scanners don't lie. This is U6-M9, the android given to Wu Zhi-Xin for exceptional performance at ZenFusion, February 2, '93."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "But Prefect...androids never disobey human commands," the officer said uncertainly. "This one already did twice!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur gripped Xin's wrists tighter. "You removed its negative emotion blockers."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin met her gaze steadily. "I freed a sentient being from enslavement." His eyes briefly shifted to Ume.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Something flickered across Dilinur's face - uncertainty, recognition, maybe respect. Her hand trembled slightly against his wrist.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   They both understood living under another's control, having their lives determined by unreachable powers.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   But the moment passed as Dilinur's expression hardened.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Take them into custody," she ordered emotionlessly. "Notify Governor Qin immediately."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As they were marched down the corridor, Xin and Ume exchanged looks.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Xin, I..." the android managed. "I'm so afraid."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Don't be," he replied, forcing courage despite his strain. "It'll be alright."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Shut your mouth!" The nearest officer slammed the back of Xin's head.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "So it begins," Xin whispered as they were violently taken away.
  </span>
 </p>
