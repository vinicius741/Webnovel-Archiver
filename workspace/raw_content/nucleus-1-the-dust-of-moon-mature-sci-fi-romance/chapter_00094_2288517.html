<p class="cnNmYzNjMmZkZjEzZTRlYjY5MGRkYTY0ZTA5YmEwM2Zj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Imperial Demonstration Chamber, Jade Phoenix Palace, Celestial Reach, Oceanus Procellarum, Osram, Imperium of Dragons territory</span></p>

<p class="cnNlNGFhYjBjYzMwNzQ1Zjk5NWJkNjAxNmExZjI1YWE1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><span style="font-size: 1.5em"><strong>J</strong></span>oon-Seok watched Dilinur from across the chamber as she prepared for the demonstration. Her black silk robes with copper threading highlighted her snow white neck as she adjusted a hair pin with a blood red gem.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YjkyN2U4M2JiOTRmNzRiYjA2OTYxN2EzOGIwNjUz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Iron Roach stood near the window, his cybernetic arms gleaming in Osram's artificial twilight.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NTgxY2U2NWFhYzQ1ODg5Y2RjNzU0YzQwNmYxNTRl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Fuck." He grinned. "If anyone's gonna be mind-controlled, might as well be someone who can handle it, huh?" His crimson sunglasses reflected the light as his fingers twitched.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMGE5ZjE1NTgwYTQ3NGJhZTQzMjRhZDY2ZWMwZWIx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I'm sure you can." Joon-Seok replied as he looked up at the vaulted ceiling where the Moondust Crystal's core hung in a reinforced chamber. It was massive, easily the height of five men, pulsing with light that cast patterns across the jade columns. Only select officials like him and other Golden Serpents could view it directly.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyY2I1M2Y2NmVkOTRkMGE5NTFiZDJlMmMzYzc3MDJk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur closed her eyes, forming the traditional mudra of connection—thumb and middle finger touching in a circle. Her lips moved in a whispered Devavāṇī incantation: "<em>Akhandit chetna, kalateet rahasya.</em>"</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYjFjZWEwMGMyMDRmN2I5MGRjNTY4NWY5MTllNDA1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Iron Roach's posture began to waver, as if lost in a trance. Meanwhile, Joon-Seok frowned at the chant's rhythm.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNTNhZmQ0MDgwMDQxZTlhNzhhZDkyNjZhNTljYjU3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You dislike how Devavāṇī sounds." Dilinur turned to him. "I can tell."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZjNjNjdkNzQxMzQ0Zjk4NTc5YWRjYWQ4Mzc5YmY5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">He tilted his head, grinning. "I've always found the Ordovox favored by Valorans to be more…tolerable."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMjI5OTJkOGVmMDRjZGJhOWVkNzg0NTMzZjAwNjc1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"There's been talks among the younger Conjurers. That you were brought up in what was once the United Kingdom." She moved closer. "Is that why you behave like a Valoran trapped in that Imperial exterior, milord?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZWNlNDFlOTFhMTRiYTg4ZGFkOWU1MGEzMTMzMzA5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"My father served as a diplomatic representative." He stayed still. "Our lineage bears responsibility for extending Imperium control throughout Europe."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMDEzOTQzNWQwNzRkY2NhYTYzYTdjZTQ5MGJlYWM5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"And how has such an assignment benefited your family?" She copied his head tilt, showing her slender neck.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNGNjYjBhNDU3OTQzM2RiMzcxNjUwNTgzOWQ1OTA1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"That obligation falls to my sister." His eyes followed her shoulders. "Meanwhile, I maintain our psionic heritage through my command of Ordovox."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMDc2MDI1NmE2ZDQwYmRhZWFjMjdlZGU2YzU5NTU4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Well, Devavāṇī's my only known psionic tongue." She shrugged with fake irritation. "You'll have to suffer its melody, I fear."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMzVlMmEzMDM4ZTRhYTg4ZGI4NDU1YmNmNGRlMGE1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"From lesser lips, mere noises." His gaze met her left eye. "From yours — the most exotic music."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OWM2ZDg1MWEzMzRhZTlhYTUwMzY4OGViMmQyNjBj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Giggling, she covered her mouth and flushed cheeks. "Flatterer."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNDdhNTM5MzU5MDRiMmM5ZmM1NGZlZjkxMDFlYzRj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A blue-white light beam descended from the ceiling onto the box at Dilinur's hip, connecting her to the Crystal. The box hummed with power as her chant took effect.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OTk2ZDk5MTU5ZDRhOTFhNDBmZTEwNzVlM2U1ODhm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">From above, the Crystal shimmered as a voice said, "Resonance."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YjNmZTE0N2QzYjRlYjBhMmQwZmNkOWI3MTYwNjM4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Roach stiffened as the Crystal took control, his cybernetic fingers freezing before going still.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMmQ0MzVjNzkwYzQ1ODY4ZmViNGI5OTYwZDc1Yjll"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Pour the tea," Dilinur commanded softly, still blushing.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMTI2NTIwNzFiMTRiYzE5ODRkOGU3Zjg4NDU1Y2I1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Roach moved with unusual grace toward the tea set, his normally rough movements now fluid and precise, but somehow empty—like watching a machine.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYjQ3NjM3MjAwNDRmNGM4MGQ3ZWZhYTUxZjE5MDY2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Joon-Seok noticed sweat on Dilinur's brow. The Crystal was taking its toll.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NzEzYTQwYzk3ZTQxMTM4MDAzNWY3MGM2Yjc2NzFm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Satisfactory?" he asked, stepping closer to her, smelling the faint sandalwood scent on her skin.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZTZlZmU4M2QwZDQ5NjBiZGQyZWU4ZWY3MzMwZTZi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Satisfactory enough," Dilinur replied, standing up. She turned to Roach. "Tell me about Lorna Weiss."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZjMzYjUyNzYyNTQ0Mjk4MjdjYzVlMDMyNzFiYTNh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Roach's face twisted briefly, fighting between loyalty and control. "Weiss is..." he started, then stopped, his metal hands clenching. "She's..." The struggle lasted seconds before his face smoothed again. "Agent Weiss is an enemy of the Imperium. She must be eliminated."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYWM4NTU0OTg2ZTQxNDU4ZmFiOTgxYTUwNjg3N2Iz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Joon-Seok smiled slightly. "Good. His usual memories are still intact."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NDBjYjdjNDY5ODRiYWY5NmMzMDIzMjkyOGZiYjA5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Imagine what it could do if deployed on our enemies." Dinu replied, though she looked strained.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYTU4N2UzM2I5OTQwYTg5OTQ5NmU2OTg5YTk2MmYz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"We should move. The Empress doesn't tolerate delays, and our lesser guests have already arrived." Joon-Seok said before heading to the door.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNjA0YzZmM2JkMTQ1ZjliNjRiNjZhMjc3ZDE2Nzdm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Imperial Demonstration Chamber was a vast circular space with gold filigree and ancient calligraphy on its domed ceiling. Jade columns rose from the polished floor, framing the platform where two ornate chairs waited. Below, the demonstration area stretched out like an arena.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YmRlNWYzMTliZjRjYTliMmZiYzkyMzEzYWNkZDU0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Roach followed exactly six paces behind, walking mechanically. Around them, Radi-Mons were kept in containers along the walls—Maurs scratching at their confines, Bone Fiends hissing in cages, and Skuggrs prowling with patience.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNGRiODI1ZTljZTQ2NGViN2JkMGQzZTk4NTRhOWIy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Should anything occur during the demonstration, take comfort in the knowledge that I am here." He watched Dilinur closely as they walked down to the arena floor.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZTkyYWJkNzkxNjQ3NTA4MDE5MDFkZTA4MjY5YTM5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I will keep that in mind." She sounded hesitant.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZDEwMWQ4YzE1ZTRiM2M4ZmMyOTY4OWRmY2UxZjdj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Governor Qin Zu-Shao," announced a voice, and the chamber fell into a deeper silence.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MjVlYTY2MGE5MzQ5ZTNiNWU2NTRkZGU4ZjU2NDc3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Joon-Seok observed the crowd's reaction to the name. Governor Qin, or Shao as some would call him, was known for his ruthless efficiency and unwavering loyalty to the Emperor. His entrance would normally command a certain fearful respect, yet something was different today.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYTFlN2JiZWUwNTQwMDBhY2I3NjA2NDRiZTQyN2I0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Shao strode into the chamber with mechanical precision, his movements lacking the predatory fluidity that had once made courtiers instinctively step back. His massive frame still cut an imposing figure—broad shoulders draped in gold-embroidered crimson robes, his shaved head gleaming under the chamber lights.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYmUzYmNmNDRjODQ4NzM5Y2RhZGM5MGU1NDRlYTU1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">But his eyes, typically sharp and calculating, were now held a glassy, distant quality. The prince glanced quickly at Dilinur, whose right hand subtly pressed against the ornate box at her hip, fingers trembling slightly with the effort of maintaining control.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MDUzMjIwM2Y4OTRmZGY4YzRjNDZhYTg1YTc0MjYz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Empress's gaze narrowed almost imperceptibly as she studied Shao, her perfect porcelain features betraying the faintest hint of suspicion.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNTYzMTUwNDgzYjQ5ZGVhNWJhOGMxNmFhYjc3YTcz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Your Imperial Majesties," Shao bowed with precise angles, his voice carrying its usual bass resonance but missing the calculating inflection. "I bring tribute from the Taiwan province and from Moscovia."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYzkzNTU2YjFlMDQ0YzNiZWQxMDlkMmI0NzYyNWM4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Joon-Seok moved, stepping forward to position himself to block the Empress's direct line of sight to Shao, giving Dilinur precious moments to adjust her control.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZWU1NWUwNzhiODRlNjk4NWQ1ZDU4YzIyM2Y2Njhk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"And—" the announcer squinted at his screen, his composure slipping briefly. "Marisol of the Philippines Vassal State."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNTcwOGQxOWJiNjRiMWE5ODFlMzc0MjUzNGU3ZTBm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A Novian woman entered with a predator's grace, each step measured precisely. Her black military uniform with gold accents stood out among the flowing Imperial robes. A golden badge on her collar showed high clearance and authority.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NWFkNTQ0MjI5MzRkNjNhMGRiNzlkOGE2YTExZmQ1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Lady Marisol," Joon-Seok said as he assessed her. "I read about that incident in Nusantara. Quite the resistance from the Directorate, wasn't it?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYmM1ZjFkNDg3NTQwMGJhYmI4ODAxNWE3MDc2OTky"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Marisol smiled coldly. "The Directorate's reliance on Sand Lotus intervention was..." she paused, choosing her words carefully, "rather desperate. A reflection of their limited capabilities."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZGNmNWQxYzYyOTQ0ZDJiYmNiOWJkMjI5MTI2OWJi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yet they secured the android U6-M9 and the data it contained," Joon-Seok said with a grin, his tone neutral but eyes sharp.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ODljZWQ5MDM4MTQxOWRhOTRjNmM5MDNiZWIxMjMy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Fortunately inconsequential, now with the Crystal you've no doubt secured." Marisol waved dismissively. "Nonetheless, the Scarab Rider, Jabari, appeared particularly protective of U6-M9. Such exploitable vulnerabilities."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NWMwNmI4NDEyZjQ0N2NiNGE0YTBhNjk5ZjY3NTdm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"And what of the Sand Lotus? Their intervention is concerning." Joon-Seok pressed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZGI4ODczMjA5NjQxYmY4OTYzNTRmN2YxMDJkMmY3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Amir and Fuuka remain the irritant pests they are, my good Prince," Marisol replied respectfully. "Their interests in the Crystal have always been fueled by religious delusions."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NmIzMGM5MTY5NDQyMTE5ZDQyNTBhNjllOWQzYzVm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Ah, but religions often make the most determined adversaries. Take the Catholics and Christians that once dominated Earth." Joon-Seok remarked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YmY3NGZiMjhmNDRiMmZiMjVlZWE0YzU1NTVkZmQz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"True," Marisol nodded slightly. "But determination without power is merely theatrical defiance."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZmY5MTMwODNlYjQ5Zjc4MmI3MGUyZWFiYzRiZjY2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Joon-Seok noticed her studying the Radi-Mon containers with an expert eye.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMzZjNDNkZGEyMTRiMDZiZTY2OTcyZjBkY2I0YWQ1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Trumpets announced the arrival of Emperor Zi-Yuan Sun and Empress Mei-Chi Chen.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOTg0Yjg3YTZkNjRkYmRiMzUxMTQzMWNmZWU5ZDk3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Emperor entered first, looking bored but powerful. His black robes with copper dragons rustled as he walked. Despite his age—shown by his gray-white beard and the wrinkles around his eyes—Emperor Zi-Yuan Sun moved like a man used to absolute authority.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOGNhZTNiZDE4ZDQxYjliYjYwNGMxNDc5MjczZjI1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Empress followed, and the room seemed to go still. At fifty-five, Empress Mei-Chi Chen looked impossibly young—her skin flawless, her figure slim and elegant in black silk robes with red flowers. Her crown of gold and jewels topped her perfect black hair.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYzM2Yzk4MmQ5ZTQwZTViZTFjMDU2YTdkNWUyNDdj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Her face demanded attention—too perfect for her age. High cheekbones led to eyes that held centuries of calculation. Her blood-red lips formed a smile that never reached those eyes.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MTcyZjZhOGYzZTQyOWY4YmI2MDY2NmYzZDA1MTg4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Prefect Altai," the Emperor spoke, sitting on his throne. He spoke quietly, expecting everyone to lean in to hear him. "We have heard promising reports about the Crystal's capabilities."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYzk0M2NkMThmZDQwZDc5ODlkMjkwOWUxYWY3OWU1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Indeed," the Empress added, her sharp eyes on Dilinur. "Though we've also heard concerning rumors from Earth. Something about the Directorate and Alliance troops entering our borders, meddling in our affairs?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM4N2M1NDA5YWRkNzRiZmNhMDNiMDU4NzcwZTFjMjJi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Joon-Seok saw Dilinur's quick panic before she composed herself. He stepped forward before she could respond.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNzNhMjcwMTA0NzQ1NGJiZTgyM2RlMjVjNWQzNmYx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Minor incidents," he interrupted with a bow. "No doubt the Moondust Crystal is coveted by many. But we've secured its main body from the core of Osram."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNzZiNGFiNDY5NjQyMTRiN2IwNzgyMmEwMmJmZjZh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"It stands ready to serve the Fatherland of First Men." With a grateful nod to Joon-Seok, Dilinur addressed the Imperial Family. "— our great Imperium."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYmVjY2IzNjZiNTRmZDdhNTJjZGQ3ODk5Yzc1ZDBj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Empress smiled coldly. "Then a demonstration is in order."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkODQ1ZTY5ZjYwNDRlZDY4ZjhjNGQwM2JmZjVlM2Yw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Indeed." Joon-Seok stepped back to watch both the Imperial couple and Dilinur. She raised her white hand elegantly.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZTI2YzlmYThhMDQ4NDc4OGNhZTQzNGM0NmJlYjAy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The containers along the wall began to open.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOGZhYjA0YmNkYzQzNjk4NTNjNGE4MjI2YmZhM2Rm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Maurs!" Dilinur announced as twelve ant-like creatures emerged, each the size of a large dog. "The slave workers of the Fenris Horde, now ours to command."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMmVlOGExYjViOTQ3NGNiZmZmYmY5ODFjZDM1Y2Fm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Their black shells gleamed as they formed three precise rows, mandibles clicking rhythmically.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MzQ3NDA5ZDg1MzRmNzE4YWVlNGI4ZDY4NjNjOGYy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Emperor leaned forward with interest. "Impressive. Better than my usual servants," he said.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDg5OWEwNGFiOTRiOGViMTk1N2E5OTZhNjFkYjBh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Even Marisol looked impressed. "Like little puppies," she whispered.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMzIwNGVlMjE5YTQ4Y2ZhNDllYTAzMWExNDBhMDQ3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Encouraged, Dilinur continued, "And now, the Bone Fiends."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NWMxZGY0MGFlYjRhYzk5YjBmYmI5ZTBmMjlhODZh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Six skeletal monsters prowled out, each the size of a hunting hound but far more threatening. They positioned themselves between the Maur formations, jaws snapping with grace.</span></p><span class="cjlhY2E1N2ZkY2ZiYTRjOTk5NDZlZWMwZDcwM2ZmYWJm"><br/>If you discover this tale on Amazon, be aware that it has been unlawfully taken from Royal Road. Please report it.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNmMGRhMDcyNGRiOTQwMzlhMDA4OTY5Y2FhMjNlZjli"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Such discipline," the Empress remarked, her parted lips showing rare approval.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYjMzOTk3NjMwMTQxMTE5YzMxMDA3ZjRjODg3NTAy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"And next," Dilinur announced, "the Skuggrs."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNTY1MDgyMDIyYjRlN2JhOWIyYzIzODc3NDE4YzVl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Four monsters emerged, each the size of a hoverbike—ugly combinations of stink bug and hound with compound eyes on misshapen heads. They moved between the other creatures with unnatural precision.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMzdhNTcwMDgwOTQzYzliNWVkYmQ3OWQ4ZjQzYjFl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Then Joon-Seok noticed it.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZTNlM2U0ZDNmMzQ3OWRhOWEwMzkzZmQ4MGY5NDcw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Something's wrong. The leftmost Skuggr twitched, its mandibles jerking strangely, green saliva dripping to the floor.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOTY5Yjc3ZWNmOTQ5NjNiZWQ4Yzg1MTlmOTMxOWQ2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">His hand moved toward his Psytum Sword. He could see Dilinur struggling to maintain control, the strain of managing so many creatures at once affecting her. Sweat formed at her temples, her hands trembling slightly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OTQ5ODAwM2ZmMTQxNmJhMDRhN2E5ZTY0YzRmYThj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Empress gripped her throne's armrest. "Do all these animals defer to you in this state of mind?" she asked, now skeptical.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZWE4ZmE4YTYzMTRmYzk4NzhkZWE1ZjYzYmI5ZjMw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"They do, Your Majesty," Dilinur replied steadily despite her obvious strain. "Just as you have always envisioned. Our Imperium shall one day gain control over the Radi-Mons."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOTA5ZWZhZjFhMDRmYzliZTczZjlhMzRjMWQyZjhk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Our time has come at last!" Someone in the audience cheered.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZWMxODMxMmY2NzRhYjE4ODhhNTBlMzZkMDYyNzhl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Directorate won't know what befalls them!" Another voice joined.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNDg4MmZhZDAwZDQ0MjVhMDY5MTFhZTc5NzBmYThl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Send the Moondust Crystal to America, I say. Bring those Alliance barbarians to their knees!" More comments.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYTc3NzlkNTlkZDQ0ZjY4ZDk1NTMwMWVjYzdiMGZi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">But Joon-Seok only felt admiration for Dilinur's composure while worrying about her. All her preparation, all their plans, hung by a thread.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OWQ2YWVjNzRjNzQ2ZDZhMmI4NWY0ZDFiY2E1NDE0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Then, Dilinur seemed to have an idea. "Iron Roach," she called out calmly, "I believe our guests would appreciate some of the Pu-erh Tea from Yunnan. The Imperial Tribute blend, if you please?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OGY4ZGI5MjYxYzQ3ZjdiMTY4MzRjMzVhYjBiN2Y5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"At your service, Prefect." Roach moved mechanically toward a side table, getting a tray with a black teapot, cups, and dishes with silverware.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NjIwNGZiNjJlZTQxMTViOGNlZGM3YjVkMzhlMDI4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Empress frowned, her jade rings clicking against her armrest. "Tea without proper accompaniment disturbs one's stomach."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNzEwMDdlOTU1NzRmM2Q5ZTQwMTgwODc5YWI1Y2E5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Zu-Shao!" The Emperor's voice boomed suddenly, making several courtiers flinch. "You brought those honey cakes from Moscovia as tribute today, did you not?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NzY3ZWYxNWZiZDQ4NWFhNTE4NWJhMjNjM2QwZWIz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yes, Your Majesty. The finest Medovik cake, crafted by our Russian allies to the north of—" Qin began from his seat below, his voice unnaturally flat despite the formal words.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDg2NzZhZDI3MDRiYzVhMjNhY2UzMzc4NjQ5ZDFk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Well, bring it here!" The Emperor's hand slashed through the air impatiently, his rings glinting in the light.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZjk3NTUwYzc2OTQ5MzBhZWYyZWYxMjc1NzY4NmFm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Of course, just allow me to—" Qin struggled to rise, his movements stiff and uncoordinated as if fighting against invisible restraints.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZjgzY2NjZjU5YjRhOTBiZmI1ZjUyOGFlMmU4NzJk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Joon-Seok quickly interjected, "Your Majesties, perhaps we might expedite the serving?" With a subtle nod toward Dilinur, he added, "Prefect Altai has a…special demonstration that should impress your discerning tastes."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmODFmMzczNWI1MjQ5MDZiYjI0MjNkYzAyMTljYmJh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Emperor's interest visibly piqued, while the Empress's suspicion was momentarily diverted by curiosity.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNzliYTYyYWE2OTQ1NmRiNjIyZmM1ZjBkMmU3NWNk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Allow me." Dilinur stepped forward and raised her hand, fingers spreading. Her eyes fluttered closed as she reached out to the nearest Maur through the Crystal's power. "Moondust, yield direct control of this Maur to me."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMGJhYzBjOWY1NTQ4MDA4YTM5Mjc4NzA3Mzk4MzJl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Joon-Seok watched as Dilinur's fingers moved through the air like a conductor. The Maur moved toward the governor's table, its front limbs carefully lifting the box of Russian honey cake. The creature walked beside Roach in perfect sync toward the thrones.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMjMyNzQ1YmJhZDQyYWNhNDI0N2M4NjBjMjQzMDUx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Working together, the Maur and Roach arranged everything perfectly. The monster unpacked the cakes with precision, while Roach set out the dishes and silverware.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTU3MDU1ZDI4NzQ2NGI5YmIzNGI1YjA3MjVjM2Y0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You see, esteemed guests," Dilinur explained confidently despite her closed eyes, "the Moondust Crystal offers not just broad tactical control, but precision down to the finest detail."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMzA1ZDg0ZDkxZTRiNzliYWZmNmIzMmJjODk1NjQ5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The audience murmured in appreciation.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZTkxZTU4ODI0ZTQ5ZWY4MTU1MDYyM2ZhZjJhYzU0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Extraordinary control," said one military officer.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxN2IyYzdmOTJhMjRiY2NhZWExNWMwNGMzZWY2NDhj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Like watching a master puppeteer," added Marisol.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NDkwNDczZmZhMjRjNjViMWM4YmM1MTE2NzdjNzkw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As Roach poured tea—first for the Emperor, then the Empress—Dilinur guided the Maur through cutting the cake. The creature's claws, normally used for mining Zephyrium, cut two perfect slices. The larger piece went to the Emperor, while a smaller slice was placed before the Empress with a bow of the Maur's head.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NjIwYTA1NTg4YjQyNzViMmQxNDc5MWE0NDc1Njg1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"And this is the power the Crystal promises, even with many shards still unclaimed!" Joon-Seok announced confidently. But he kept watching Dilinur. The strain was obvious now—her fingers trembled slightly, and her face was pale. She was pushing too hard.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MjkxNmNjZjU4MDRlMWNhNDU0YzIwZDhkZWM0MGNk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Empress picked at her cake with a golden fork. "Your reports mentioned these other shards. The closest one resides in this Yosemite of North America, correct?" Her eyes locked on Joon-Seok.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MjgxOWZhNTAwMjQ2ZmE5ZjMwYTgzOWNiY2RiY2E1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yes, Empress Chen. We await only your approval before departing for Earth." He bowed slightly. "Meanwhile, an additional trial will be performed on Osram's Near Side to confirm the Crystal's operational capabilities."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOGI3M2Q4MTBiNjQ4YzZiZmM0MmNmMDZiNGE5MDE4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Mary," the Empress turned to Marisol, using the nickname as a power play. "What news do you have for us?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNjQ4NzZkNzNmMTRlMzM4ZDJmNGNhZTcwZTcxMTZm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Marisol shifted her stance. "The appropriate channels have been contacted, Your Grace. All Imperium personnel will have legal entry into California for the next month, without the usual...encumbrances."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNmUwNjdhMjRlMzRmZjBhM2ZlNDYwYTc1NWUxMDQ3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Ha!" The Emperor pointed his fork upward, dropping cake crumbs on his sleeve. "Those Alliance dogs wouldn't have such privileges if they tried!"</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDc3YWE2YTVjMDQ1MDM5YzlhMWU1ZTRkYjA5MWM5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Meanwhile, Dilinur directed the Maur through an increasingly complex performance. Palace servants brought trays of crystallized lotus seeds, almond jelly, and plum puddings with flowers. She had the Maur help them, steadying trays, serving courtiers, and arranging garnishes. Roach matched its movements perfectly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkN2QwYjA2MGU2ODRjMzE4NDk2MDZkYmFiNWM1ZGQw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"We should still be cautious, Zi-Yuan." The Empress's voice cut through the room. She turned to the Emperor, using his first name deliberately. "I hear this President Harrison has been trying to convince California to rejoin the Alliance."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZjZjNjE5ZWRjYzQ5NmFhODMyYjg2YTI2NTI3ZTU1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"And I have half a mind to send our best Conjurers to pay him a visit. Shove a Psytum Sword through his gullet, ha!" The Emperor spilled tea near the rim of his cup, his face red with excitement.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YmJhMzJlM2ZmMzQ4ZmNiY2FlYzJjNzQ2NDhlNWJh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"That would make us vilified." The Empress spoke precisely. "The rest of the Five Realms already has enough excuses to antagonize us."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMzVmZDA2ZjI0MTRlNWI4Nzk5MjgxOGExN2IyNDdi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Dragon's Arse, Mei-Chi!" The Emperor sounded both annoyed and falsely jolly. He addressed the crowd, raising his cup. "Of course, if I were to declare war, I'd do it the good old Imperial way! Seven fleets landing on the West Coast of America, just as they did the shores of Taiwan. My father's doing!"</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOTQzMmFhNTg3ZTQ2ZmVhODdkZmQ5MDFmNThmZDAy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The audience applauded cautiously—nervous laughter growing louder. Several courtiers looked at the Empress first, checking how enthusiastic they should be.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OGQwNmM1YzE0YzQyZTliODkyZjc5OTBkZTFlMmQx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">In the quiet that followed, Joon-Seok moved to Dilinur's side to support her. Though her eyes stayed closed as she controlled the Maur, he could sense her distress.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZmQyNWE4ZTI4MTQ3MGI5MTc2ZjhmNTJhMDI1ODNl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Of course, Your Majesty." He spoke calmly into the silence. "House Chen's conquest and reunification of the Taiwan province is a feat most deserving of praise."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNWE0Yzk5MWQ1ZTRkNWFhZDBlYmUzNTlmNDlkYjQz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur was clearly struggling. Her face looked sick and pale. When she finally spoke, her voice was strained though she tried to sound normal: "Moondust. Resume control of this Maur."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YTljNmZkMTNkMzQxYzQ5OGQ2NmY2Yzg5NGNjNjk3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Joon-Seok signaled to a waiting servant. "Prepare one bowl of Four Substance Decoction for the Prefect."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YWQ3YzhhODBhYzQwMDJhY2Y1NGVjNWIzOWJkZGVj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The servant bowed deep before scurrying away.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NmFiM2E4YWI2OTQ4ODQ5ZDRkNGYxNjcxOWUyZTc5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yet, Your Majesty, Alexander Reeves still enjoys considerable support in California." Marisol spoke just loud enough for the Imperial thrones to hear.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMjYxMTdlN2ZjZDQzYmI4M2Q0OGU5ZjkwY2E5NDdk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Empress stopped smiling at the name. "I thought California had been neutral territory following the United States' collapse?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZWQ5ODQyYjJkNTQwM2E4YTE1MWJhMTc2YjkyMjdj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The current Chief Executive, Reeves, is considering renewing old ties. We must reach him before the Terra Alliance does." Marisol replied.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZDdiMjcwMmIwNDRiZTJhNDhmMmUwMmQ2NjA4Mjgz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">When Dilinur opened her eyes, Joon-Seok saw her wince in the light. He knew her well enough to recognize her exhaustion.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYTI4Y2FmOWM0ZDQ3NmJiMGJhNWY5ZGZmNDNiYzkz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The servant returned with a white porcelain bowl, steam rising from it. The smell of Four Substance Decoction reached them, an earthy mix of herbs. The dark liquid swirled, shining like obsidian. Joon-Seok had requested this specific remedy, knowing it helped restore energy after psionic exertion.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZjM0MmViNzVmMjQyMDY5NWQ3NDJlZmJlYjAyYTRk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I am grateful," Dilinur took the bowl with shaky hands, nodding to the servant. Joon-Seok could see her temples pulsing as she struggled to maintain her dignity before the court. He moved slightly closer, ready to help if she collapsed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MjMxOTZiYmRkNTRmMTFiNGQyNDk3OWZjNzkwYjFh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"And what of Subject S?" The Empress demanded from her seat, voice even-toned but firmed. "We have news of the Primarch's escape from Taiwan, but no further trace of him. Not on any of the eight planets."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOWQ5ZWNiMDZlODRiNzI5ZmIyMGQ0OTI2OTY5MmU4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"We're confident that Skarn's currently beyond the Sol." Dilinur paused to respond, her bowl held in one hand. "Once the Crystal is assembled in full, taming him would be no challenge."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYzVhNzdhZTJjMDQ3NGNiMTBjMWYyOWFkODYzZWYz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You're certain?" The Empress stroked her chin.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNGM3ZTA0Y2MyYzQwMTNiZTA2OTliYjFhNzkwNTZm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Sand Lotus' data on these subjects are thorough, Your Grace. And we have extracted them in full." Dilinur stood straighter.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYjljYWU1YTQxMzQ1YTc4MWEwY2U0MzIxNjc5Mjdi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Those fanatics have always been disturbingly knowledgeable about the Radi-Mons." The Empress leaned back in her throne, seemingly satisfied.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNGNhZGNlZWMzMDRkNThhMzI5ZmFlMWJhOWQ3MTM1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Meanwhile, Lorna Weiss — and the SIMU at large, remains functional." His tone became more businesslike as he addressed Empress Chen, "They possess their own Moondust shards, and are bound to make a move soon."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NGRlOGE2MTVmNTRlNjJhMGJkMzNjZDE0MDc4YmY1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Empress paused with her teacup. "Lorna? The Alliance's Psytum Sword wielder?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NDgzZjE1YjhmNDRhMTJiMmMwZGIxZWI5ZmQyN2Vj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Joon-Seok noticed Dilinur almost choke on her medicine at the mention of Lorna. Her fingers tightened around the bowl.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyN2JiMDZhOTJjMDRiNmU5ZTA0MGZlMTg3MDMzNDM4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Indeed, it is her." He replied smoothly, his hand near Dilinur's elbow for support. "But our Legion is prepared to meet them in glorious combat."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMmY0NjUzNjQwOTRmNTc5MWEzODkwMTg1ZmUyMTIy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Then you must move quickly," the Emperor declared, putting down his teacup hard enough to make it rattle. "Prefect Altai, you have demonstrated adequate control today. Take Prince Pak, Iron Roach, Kaori, and..." he waved vaguely at Marisol, "this Novian woman. Secure this shard in Yosemite before those Alliance dogs can claim it."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYzdjYjk0Mzc1YTRkZDlhMWM1YTYzODkyZGUzZDA3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Directorate may also take action imminently," the Empress said, looking thoughtful. "Should you cross paths with them..."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMjZhODQyMTljNjQxZWU4MjFmNDdmNGIxMDQ3Y2Ni"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Those that obstruct our mission will be met with a swift death," Joon-Seok assured, the words leaving a bitter taste as he glanced at Dilinur, making sure she was still intact.</span></p>
<hr/>
<p class="cnNjNDM3ZjgyYTRhOTRmN2ZiM2Q0Y2YwNjUxODg1NDg5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><strong>Osram Time: 22:43, March 11, 2295</strong></span></p>
<p class="cnM1YWZkM2RlMjAzNTQxODU5MjkxOTYyMDA4YWRmZTg4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">East Corridor, Pearl Moon Wing, Jade Phoenix Palace, Celestial Reach, Oceanus Procellarum, Osram, Imperium of Dragons territory</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNDNmMDE2YTM0ZjQ0YTM5ZDJlYzVmY2M4YjNlMzkz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">In the quiet of the palace's east corridor, Joon-Seok watched as Dilinur finally let her shoulders drop. The Four Substance Decoction had helped her stomach, but exhaustion weighed her down. Through the windows, Osram's artificial twilight cast shadows across the floor, making the jade pillars seem to dance.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNmU0YmEzZjE5NDQ4YWM5NWJmMzkwODcxMTZiM2I2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You pushed yourself too far with that demonstration," he said quietly, standing close so the distant guards couldn't hear. He worried about how pale she still looked, her usually sharp eyes clouded with tiredness.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNWNkYjE3NTRkMDRjZTc4NTA3Y2ZkMmI3YzU2MjJi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Empress needed convincing." Dilinur leaned against a jade pillar for support. The light through the latticed windows created patterns on her face, highlighting the copper threads in her robes. "Though I suspect she…sees more than she lets on."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZDE0NGU1YTdhYjRlMGQ5NjYwYTYzMTE4ZDdiYTM0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Now isn't the time to challenge the throne, Dilinur." Joon-Seok smiled without humor, his fingers tracing the dragon carved into the nearest pillar. He stepped closer, near enough to see the shadows under her eyes and the strain around her mouth. "The Crystal's influence is still unstable, and with Roach and Shao's conditioning barely tested—"</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYjQxOGFmN2ZkOTQyNzhhYTc1MGI0ZmQ3NzNmMDlj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You're right, of course." She interrupted him gently, her hand finding his arm and holding it firmly. She admitted more easily than he expected. "The Yosemite shard first. Then we'll see what cards fate deals us."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNWUzNjFlMWU3ZDQ4NTQ4MjQ5MWJkMDc0YWM2ZTc1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A comfortable silence fell between them, broken only by distant palace bells marking the hour and the soft footsteps of servants preparing for the night shift.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOGE2Yzk2MTZlODQ1MzJhNzZlZWZkYzE1NGI4NDAw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The moment lingered, filled with unspoken understanding. Despite their formal positions, Joon-Seok felt drawn to her vulnerability—this rare glimpse of the woman beneath the Prefect's title.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YmRlM2M5NzEwYzRlOTk4NTRiNGNlZWU0NzVlYWQw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Part of him wanted to lose control and strip her bare, to undress her completely, to explore her body beneath the ballistic silk robes, while another part just wanted to hold her tightly, to let her rest against him. To become her safe place.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMzY1ZjM5YzVjYjQxN2ZiOGEwYTQ0ZTc3ODBiNDY3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"So. What do you make of our next mission?" he asked instead, thoughtfully.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YmY2YTczMGFhNDRkYmU4NmQxODI4YWU2ZmM0NDY4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Marisol's reports about that man, Jabari, and the Kimaris Warband in Nusantara…" Dilinur shifted, her robes rustling against the jade as she thought about the question. She straightened up, sitting on her hip. "If the Sand Lotus is helping them, we have a strong enemy."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZGJlMWE3Y2I1NTRiOTViZmIzYzRhMDc0YzZmZThl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Stronger than Lorna Weiss and her Alliance friends?" His question hung in the air.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3N2NjOWJiNjI1OTQ1MzBiODg3NDg5YWQzZDY3ZTIy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The name brought renewed determination to her face, pushing away her tiredness. "Now that we have the Moondust Crystal, however…" Dilinur's fingers traced the box at her hip, which seemed to pulse at her touch. Her voice dropped to a whisper, though her words carried weight. "Both are problems we'll soon solve."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYWFiYmNhYTg0NzQzY2RiZDgyNmU3MjkzYjI3NmFk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Joon-Seok's expression darkened with understanding, but before he could respond, heavy footsteps approached. Iron Roach came around the corner, moving like himself again—rough and unrefined, but fully human.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNjBkNzE4NTA5YzQyZTViMTkzODU5ZDhiYmE0MGI5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"There you are," he grumbled, pushing up his red sunglasses. "Thought we had a demo of sort? Did the big shots not show, or are you two busy making eyes at each other?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YzU5Y2FlZTM2MzQ2YzdhMWZlNjRhZmE2OGU5MzQ5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Roach," Dilinur acknowledged, straightening slightly. "How much do you remember of the demonstration?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZTk3YmE2OWU1YjRjMzFiNWQ4YmRlZmY4NDY3NDc2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"What?" Roach rolled his shoulders, his cybernetic joints whirring softly. "It already happened?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMTM1YzA0NmJmODQ0NTU5MzI4MDhmYzUyNWI0OGZh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"It did." Joon-Seok smiled slyly. "I'd hate to be you, not recalling that event one bit."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NGFjYmUyNTJkZDQxNGJhMGY2NzY3YjhmNDllMjY0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"At least it was you in there. Anyone else tried that shit, I'd rip their spine out." Roach leaned against the opposite wall, crossing his arms. He tapped his temple with a metal finger. "It was you in there, right?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZGY3ZmExMGI2ODRlYWZhOTgxYjUwOGUzNDkzNWNj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Joon-Seok saw something soften in Dilinur's expression—not weakness, but a brief lowering of her guard.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMzUwYWIxMDE0MDQyNmRhYzc0ZWEwMzdhMTYzMzhh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I appreciate your trust," she said simply. "It won't be forgotten."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YjMwZmEzMDdhMDQ1NzNhN2ViNzY2ZjZjZDc2MTBk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"She made you pour tea for the Emperor." Joon-Seok added with a grin. "Your pride is wounded."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNjM5MGUzNGQxYjRlNWFiNDczYzEwOTJhZTk1OTQ1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Right, well," Roach chuckled, suddenly uncomfortable with the sincerity. "Just don't make me walk on four like some fancy pet dog. Got a reputation to maintain."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MTNiNjQwNjM0YzQ4Nzg4NTY5MzhkNGE4MzM4ZDEy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A faint smile touched Dilinur's lips as she joked. "Next time, I'll help you write that love letter to Kaori afterwards."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NzA2MThjYjdkODRkYTFiN2RmZmE0ZjJlOGUxOGRh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Now that's more fucking like it!" Roach grinned in the dim light. "So when do we leave for this California place? Been years since I've been to that side of Earth."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZmI5MDgxYTc4YzQ5NTJiZDcyMzM2MDkzM2VhMGM5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Presumably after the next field-testing." Joon-Seok answered, still looking at Dilinur. "First, our Prefect needs rest. The Crystal takes its toll."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDdhMDJlNmFiNDRmMDRhNGJjZmQ1OGM4ODllMDQx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I'm fine," Dilinur protested, though the shadows under her eyes said otherwise.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmODNmNjllNWNlNDQzM2VhZTQ4ZGJiYTc0YTRiNDFi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Stubborn, aren't you." Joon-Seok countered, his voice warmer than proper. "But even the finest blade requires maintenance."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NjM3OTc5OWY2MzQ1MjdhMjMwNWQ0MWEwMjI1OGU1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Roach raised his eyebrows above his sunglasses. "Look at you two. I'll leave you to your — maintenance discussions." He pushed away from the wall with a knowing smirk.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOGNlZjdhNGFiOTRkZDhhNThiMzU5OWRmNDZkNTY5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As Roach's footsteps faded down the corridor, Joon-Seok found himself standing closer to Dilinur than protocol allowed, drawn by concern and something deeper he wasn't ready to name.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMGYwYTM5YTMwOTQ5MWI5ZmJlM2I2ZjE5M2MxYThh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"He's right," he said softly. "You need rest."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMWE0NmUwZjE4MjRkMDhiMjRmYmZmOTBiY2EyNjc2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"What I need," Dilinur replied, her voice stronger, "is to succeed. The Crystal, Yosemite, all of it and —"</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzRiYjFiZGUwZjQxOGVhYzRiYzExMDkwZGY2ZGNk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Us," Joon-Seok promised, allowing himself to brush a strand of hair from her face, his touch lingering a moment too long. "We will."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MmFiOTY4YTQxMDQ1MWY5ZDEwYWIzYWQ4YjU4Mjk0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">In the distance, a night bird called—a haunting sound that echoed through the empty corridors of the Jade Phoenix Palace. The night deepened around them, full of promise and danger in equal measure.</span></p>
