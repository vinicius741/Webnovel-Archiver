<p class="cnM4ZjJjNmYyYWJmYTQyNDVhMGM4ODk1OTQ4ZjdkODE5">The next day and a half passes by rather quickly. With one battle going on after another, and some even occurring at the same time. All with me reading my book throughout the battles, only occasionally pausing to check out the powers of the competitors. Mostly because that information could be useful in the future.</p>
<p class="cnM4MmFhNGJmYWJkZjQ5ZmViZjIxODc4ZTRlMzBjNTU0">And by the end of it all, I find myself standing in the center of the arena myself as the MC’s voice rings out throughout the stadium.</p>
<p class="cnNhYzNhOGJiZGY2YzRhMWI5NTcyYjY4MDVjZjk3OTg4">“Now, before we start the final round, we have a special exhibition match for you all to see!!!” the MC says, sounding more than a little excited as one competitor after another appears around the rather massive arena. An arena that has only grown larger since the beginning of the tournament somehow. “As many of you already know, our universe has had unique beings known as Horsemen of the Apocalypse for over a million years now. Ever since the First Era of Chaos, these special beings have been appearing one after another. The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.”</p>
<p class="cnM1MjM2YjI1Y2RjMzRkZDdiMjA1MGI1ZjAzZGE4MzFi">The excitement in the arena starts to grow a little confused due to the topic the MC is discussing, but most people still continue cheering due to their favored competitors standing in the arena.</p>
<p class="cnMzNGViYzY1OGUxODRmODZhYWZmYTE1ZjYzMDRhN2Q2">“Unlike most people, the Horsemen of the Apocalypse are beings created purely by the energy that they represent,” the MC declares, surprising me a little with some knowledge about myself that I didn’t actually know. And apparently a lot of the audience didn’t know it either as they start to quiet down even more. “The Horsemen are created solely when the energy of their being has grown so dense within the universe that it grows dangerous for the denizens of the universe. So they are made as both a cure and a disaster. One meant to absorb the growing apocalyptic energy in the universe.”</p>
<p class="cnMzNmVmNjk5NmVlNDRjYTM5N2Y5MjQyMDAxYzA0YWY2">At this point, everyone in the stadium is silent. Whether they’re competitors or the audience. Or even myself. Not that I was talking in the first place.</p>
<p class="cnM2YTUyMzQ4MzkzYjQ2MjQ4ZjlmMmRiMGRhYmE4ZmNi">“Many people assume these Horsemen of the Apocalypse are naturally terrible beings,” the MC continues, almost making me raise a brow at how open she’s being about that despite said Horsemen no doubt hearing her other than myself. “But that is false. The Horsemen are merely affected by their own energy, guiding them towards certain paths just like humans are. They are not inherently evil beings.”</p>
<p class="cnM1MDM0ZWU3OWU3MzQ0NmFhMDkyMTgwZjY2NTcyZmMz">Now whispers are beginning to spread across the stadium as I put my hands in my pockets and tilt my head a little. Only for the large screen above the arena to suddenly start showing me as I stand here blinking up at the audience in surprise.</p>
<p class="cnMzNjcxMjkwYjg5NDRiZTlhNDdkMjcwNzQ4NzdiZGM5">“With all that said, let me introduce someone to the universe as a whole,” the MC declares. “She is the Princess of the Crimson Empire, ally to the Rex Dynasty of the Dead, contracted partner of the Crown Prince of the Eternal Dynasty, ally to the Grand Silvanian Empire-” the lady continues on with a rather long list of titles before finally finishing with “-and the Horseman of the Apocalypse, Death herself!!!”</p>
<p class="cnNmOTY1YjlhNmY1NjQxNDFiZjMwODczZDJhNTljNDYz">The whispers grow more numerous as they all look at me and at the screen showing me. But gradually, a lot of shouts begin rising from within said audience from people I’ve met over the years. Many of whom recognized me from my actions at Hunter’s Spots judging by the things they’re shouting. Mostly things like how they recognize me, how I’m not a bad person from what they saw, and the like.</p>
<p class="cnMwOTA3M2IxZjUxNzRkNTJhNjlhY2I0ZGYxMjAzMWVm">Then other whispers start talking about my looks. That I look like a cute young woman and nothing more.</p>
<p class="cnNjZmYyYTk2NTQ2MjQyYzRhNDgyNTA0NGQ3ZjA0N2Yx">Overall, especially with the previous explanation the MC gave about the Horsemen and all of my titles, removing a lot of prejudice these people may have had against me.</p>
<p class="cnM3YWMwYjhmZjUyMTRiMmJiYTIxNTc2MzczMWVhMWUz">Which is interesting and probably what Shirogane and the emperor were going for with this whole thing.</p><span class="cmMwZTQwMzQ2NzJmNTQ4Yjg5MDFkNmQ2NzA1NGUxMDlh"><br/>This story is posted elsewhere by the author. Help them out by reading the authentic version.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM5MWYwMmJmYThkNDQxOGU4N2IzYzM1YjcwYWI0OWY3">And now it’s time for the next part of their little plan.</p>
<p class="cnNlMmY4YzFhNDI1ZDQzYjdiNGY0NWQwMjg4OTM2NzJj">“As ordered by the Emperor of the Eternal Dynasty, the Silver Emperor, Shirou Amatsuraki, the exhibition match between the Horseman of Death, Aria Crimson, and the two hundred competitors of the tournament, will soon begin!” the MC declares, sounding like she’s getting rather into this herself. “This will be a two hundred versus one match, with death or surrender being the only way out for any of the competitors participating! Beyond that, the rules are simple! The battle must stay within the confines of the arena. There is a spell in place to teleport anyone who leaves it back into the arena again, as well as a spell in place to make the arena nearly impenetrable by even one of the Nine Grands.”</p>
<p class="cnM3MjcyNjE3YzIxZTQ0Y2ZhYzYzNmNjODg5YTY3MDY3">Now the audience sounds like they’re getting excited again. So that’s a thing.</p>
<p class="cnMwZTZjODBhZDhhZTQ0YTZhMzVlZjU5MDMxMGNlZjcx">Honestly though, I really couldn’t care less about what people think about me.</p>
<p class="cnNmODQyZTJmZGUyNjQ3MjliZGY2NTk5N2VmYTY4MjI4">Not like most of them will be alive for most of my life anyways.</p>
<p class="cnMxOTA1OGEyZGNkZTQ3YWZhMGQxZWM0MWE0MWJhNGZl">After all, the rate at which one’s lifespan doubles decreases rapidly after reaching the four digits in level. From once every one hundred levels to once every three hundred. Then again after level 2500 from once every three hundred levels to once every one thousand levels.</p>
<p class="cnNjM2FhZTlhOTM2ZjQyMDZhM2EzZmU4MzVkZGI1YTA3">Even the Nine Grands, except maybe the other Horsemen, will eventually die.</p>
<p class="cnM0NGRkNGM3NmYzNzQzNThhY2NkNjFhMzhkNmI3MTM0">So why should I worry about the opinions of people who I won’t be seeing for long?</p>
<p class="cnMzNGI2ZWE1ZGY2MDQwZDY4NjA3NjU0MzM5M2VjOTUy">All that aside…</p>
<p class="cnNjZGFhNTQzMzU2NzQxNDhiNzZjYzMwYzFmMGI4YmZm">I look down while crossing my arms in thought as the MC declares, “Now with that said, leeeeeet the exhibitiiioooonnnn maaatch begiiiiiiiiinnnnn!!!!”</p>
<p class="cnNhMzYwN2ViNjRkNDQ1OTVhOWRlYWI2ODIzNjgyZWZi">…it’s rather interesting how-</p>
<p class="cnNjNGYxMDZlNmQ2ZjQxNGE5NDViMDAzYzdkZmNlN2U4">My thoughts come to a brief halt when I’m blasted by hundreds of attacks at once. Then I reform again at the center of the arena, briefly glancing up at the two hundred currently shocked looking faces staring at me. Or at least, most are shocked. Some aren’t.</p>
<p class="cnMyYmU4NTI3ZmVhZDQ3ODRhZGMyY2U5Yjc5YTVkZjQ2">Then I look back down and return to my thoughts as some of them start attacking me again.</p>
<p class="cnNiODlmNTI4MDliNzRiYzY4MzQ4NWI2YzNjMTZmZTM0">It’s rather interesting how the Horsemen were born. Also interesting how no one in the universe has made this public until now.</p>
<p class="cnMwZDMyYTk4NmQyNTQzYWFhZWU3MTgwZDM3YWIxMGUw">My thoughts repeatedly cut in and out as my body is blown to smithereens, torched, boiled, erased, poisoned, and whatever else these people can possibly do to me. But I keep just returning to my current line of thought as they hack away.</p>
<p class="cnNmYzg0ODk0MTg1MDQ0NDViODcwODNlMTY2NjFjYjA3">The idea that the Horsemen of the Apocalypse were originally naturally formed by the universe in order to absorb the apocalyptic energies within it is not what I would’ve expected we were made for. But at the same time, it makes quite a bit of sense.</p>
<p class="cnM3YWY4MGRjOTY4ZjQwMjk4Y2RlNzlhOTAxN2ZhZmU0">Although I get the feeling the universe can’t really think. Otherwise it would’ve understood that creating four apocalyptic beings to absorb the apocalyptic energy isn’t a very good idea either. All things considered.</p>
<p class="cnM1OWY2NTJmZWU2YTQwMmVhMThiZTdlZGQ2M2Q4NDVh">Unless it just cares about the energy and not the beings in the universe?</p>
<p class="cnM4MjFmZjQwNjk3NTRhMzM4Njk5ZTQ1YjkzYjlhYTUz">Then it would make more sense.</p>
<p class="cnNkNjk1NWQ4Yzk2NzRmNjc5NTczMDcwNjRiNjIxY2Jl">Also, my thoughts continuously cutting off as I’m trying to think about this is getting annoying, so after my most recent reformation, I look at the people blasting away at me and finally pay attention to the MC who is shouting her head off with excitement. Something about how incredible this is, seeing me being blasted to pieces over and over again by some of the strongest people in the universe and just reforming like it’s nothing.</p>
<p class="cnM1YWYyMzM4Zjk2NzRmMmRhMGFhY2E3OTgyNzM2NDY0">Honestly, I’m rather happy about this whole exhibition match as a whole. If for no reason other than the adaptations I’m gaining from this. Considering that I’m gradually recovering faster and faster from every attack these guys are making.</p>
<p class="cnMxMzY5YmExMzAwODRmNWY4ZmE0NDZjYTkzMmRmODQ1">But some of them are starting to lose motivation in attacking me and are surrendering. Decreasing the number of people attacking.</p>
<p class="cnMyMTEzYTA2OGVlZjQxMDFhYTkyNDcyOTFmZDk3NmJk">Well, the origin of the Horsemen aside, I really don’t care what the universe wants.</p>
<p class="cnM3YWI2MmI4YjBhYzRkYzI5OTZkZGZkM2ZkYjMwZTY0">I’ll just do what I do best.</p>
<p class="cnNkYjYwNjM5ZWQzYjRiNmViZTQ0NTgwNjUwOTg4ZTkw">And that’s whatever I want to do.</p>
<p class="cnNmMGU4YzI3OTUyYzQ4N2FhNjQ0MzgwNzU4NTg2ZGZm">I glance at Shirogane, who is also blasting me with bolts of pure liquid silver with an amused smirk on his face. Probably only bothering with attacking in order to show how strong I am to the others, seeing as he knows by now that I can’t die.</p>
<p class="cnMwZjU3OWQ0NWE1NzQyMTJiZjQwYWFiNWZiNmEzMjc0">So after giving him a silent nod of greeting, I return to looking at the ground as the crowd goes wild. Just getting lost in my own thoughts again.</p>
<p class="cnNiMGIzMTUzYTJhZTQ1YTQ4ODVhNjFlOWIwNmRjZDI1">Also briefly regretting the fact that it’s not possible to place the enchantment my clothes have on a book. The one that makes damage pass through the clothes onto me. Which is kinda necessary right now, otherwise I’d long since have become naked in front of these people.</p>
<p class="cnM5N2RiNDk4MGY1ZDQzYTI5MzYwNmI4ZTE0M2Q5NTY1">And while I have no sexual or romantic urges as a Horseman of the Apocalypse, that doesn’t mean I want to go around naked or anything.</p>
<p class="cnMyNDVlMDI3ZmU5NTQ2ZmQ5NjVmMjJjN2M2MGM0OTBl">I just wish I could read while these guys blast me with spells.</p>
<p class="cnNjYmMyYTExNzljNTQ5ZmZiMmFlMWU1YmUyM2JlMjli">That thought rolls around in my head for a few seconds as I get blasted to death over and over again, occasionally tossed around when some of them try to move onto physical attacks.</p>
<p class="cnNiYTIxNmVmOTNmMTQ3OWY4M2U0NjEyOTI0M2M1Y2M1">But all that I can think of is the simple fact that even if I could read, I probably wouldn’t enjoy it much right now.</p>
<p class="cnMzYWEwNjAzMjE2ZTQ0ZjBiMzFhYjM0MGUzZWIzZmEx">A pity.</p>
