<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnM3MmUyNWJhYjUxNjRiZjhiMzRiNWNkMTEwYzI0NDA0"><span style="font-weight: 400">The sound of knocking roused Argent from her slumber. She sat up, momentarily disoriented by the unfamiliar surroundings. She took in the details one by one: the soft bed with its patchwork quilt, the worn wooden floor, the scent of lavender and woodsmoke. Memory returned in fragments, of the heist, the component, rain-soaked streets. This room at the inn, a temporary sanctuary she'd reluctantly accepted.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MGZhNzI4NjhlYzQxZGM5OGY1ZWU3YzNmOTY3MGI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Outside her window, the steady drumming of rain continued unabated, her constant companion. She noticed puddles forming on the windowsill despite the shutters being closed tightly against the downpour. The golden light of late afternoon filtered through the gaps, casting long shadows across the floor. She'd slept far longer than intended.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDVhYzQyMmZiNDQwOThiOGIzYTJmNzA1YjhkNDZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Room service," came Axel's cheerful voice from the other side of the door, muffled but unmistakable. "Dinner for the heroic angel, delivered by her equally heroic demonic colleague."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZTE4YzNkMzg3ZjQ2Yzg5NzBlMWJlNGIzMTcyN2M5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Argent smoothed her rumpled clothing and pushed an errant strand of hair behind her ear before opening the door, a futile gesture of normalcy. Axel stood balancing a wooden tray laden with food and a bottle of wine, his crimson hair even more unruly than usual. Water droplets clung to the fiery strands, sparkling like tiny embers in the afternoon light. His eyes creased at the corners as he smiled at her.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NWI0ODE5NjJlNzQ1ZmY5MWE3ZTI2YjU2NGUyNGNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">"I was beginning to think you'd sleep through to tomorrow," he said, breezing past her to set the tray on the small table by the window. His movements were fluid, graceful in a way that reminded her he wasn't human, despite his casual demeanor. "The bath is ready when you are, but I thought you might want sustenance first."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NjE1ZWYyNTA2NDQ3MjJiYWQxYzRiNmZkZDFiYTY4"><span style="font-weight: 400">The aroma of roasted meat, herbs, and fresh bread made Argent's stomach growl embarrassingly. She couldn't remember the last time she'd eaten properly. "Thank you," she said quietly, eyeing the spread as Axel poured wine into two earthenware cups. Steam rose from the food and her mouth watered.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiODVmZWY2NDdhYjRiY2I4ZGVmZTA0MzBmZDc0MTBm"><span style="font-weight: 400">"The innkeeper's finest," he proclaimed with mock solemnity, offering her a cup. The glazed pottery was warm against her fingers. "Which isn't saying much, but beggars can't be choosers."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZGIzMzAzZjBiZjRlNjI4NjQwYWM2ZTY4NGYzMjI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Argent accepted the wine cautiously, taking a small sip. It was sweeter than she expected, with an undertone of berries and something earthy she couldn't name. The warmth spread through her chest, battling the chill that had settled into her bones. "It's good," she said, surprised.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZjM3NGQxODZkMTRmZGU4YTViNGU2MzQ0ODFkZDhm"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Damning with faint praise," Axel laughed. He raised his own cup in a toast. "To successful heists and unlikely alliances."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ODFhN2U4ZDEzNTQ0YTQ4YjZlNDI3MDg4NjQ5OWEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">After a moment's hesitation Argent tapped her cup against his. The ceramic made a soft clink in response. "To returning what was stolen," she offered, her voice softer than intended.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYTNhODIwOTkwZDRhNmI5YTkwMTcyMzNhOWJlMGJk"><span style="font-weight: 400">They ate in a silence that gradually shifted from awkward to comfortable. Argent was surprised by her own appetite as she tore into the roast chicken, soaking up the juices with the crusty bread. As she ate, she found herself sneaking glances at Axel, who seemed entirely at ease, one leg slung casually over the arm of his chair. His long fingers tore pieces of bread with deliberate grace, and she noticed that he seemed to be merely eating to keep her company; he left most of the food to her.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZGIwMDRhZTRjYjQ2ZDhiYzZjMWU1NmQzZmQ5MDM3"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Why are you really here?" she asked finally, setting down her cup. The question had been circling her mind since their first encounter in the tavern. "The truth this time."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMGRiZjg3NDhmNDQ0NDBhYWM4NWU3NWViY2Q4YWYy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Axel's ever-present smile dimmed slightly, revealing something more complex. He studied the wine in his cup as if it might contain the answer, swirling it gently as he stared into its depths. "Would you believe me if I said I was curious?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMGIyMDhhY2QwODQ1MzU5MmIzMTM1YzFiYmY4MjA0"><span style="font-weight: 400">"About what?" Argent pressed, her eyes fixed on his face, searching for deception.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxN2ZlMzI3OTY3OTRjNzU5MGU2NWZiYjQ2NDc3YWE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">"About you." He looked up, his red eyes meeting hers directly. There was no challenge in them, no mockery, just genuine interest that made her inexplicably uneasy. "Angels don't usually walk alone among mortals. They certainly don't concern themselves with stolen machine parts or struggling towns."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkN2E2YTRmYzFlZTQ0ODZhZTZiNmYyZGYwOTJmZGMw"><span style="font-weight: 400">The observation struck closer to home than she cared to admit. Her shoulders tensed slightly, causing a faint trickle of rainwater to seep through the ceiling above her, a physical manifestation of her discomfort. "You were watching me before we met at the tavern."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjODM5NTJjMzM3MzRlODI5NWJjOWI5YzM3ZTBjYjU2"><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn't a question, but Axel nodded anyway, unashamed. "You stood out. An angel trying very hard to be inconspicuous, yet helping humans without any apparent agenda." He tilted his head curiously, reminding her of a bird examining something shiny. "Most of your kind look down on mortals. See them as pets, or at best, helpless children who need guidance."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZWRkYjNjYmRkYjQ5ZmQ4ZTU1MmQxZmQ3NGE3MTc5"><span style="font-weight: 400">"And demons don't?" she countered, a defensive edge creeping into her voice.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjZjZDA1NTg0MTQ4ODhiOWQ0YzhiZGNkYzcyNjQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Oh, we're definitely worse," he admitted with a wry smile that showed teeth just slightly too sharp to be human. "We see them as playthings or food. But you..." He gestured with his cup, the movement encircling her. "You care about them. Genuinely. It's fascinating."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNWU0NTJlNzU0YzRjNzliOGJhNTE0M2FkMWU2Nzg2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Argent wasn't sure how to respond. The attention made her feel strangely exposed, as if he could see the doubts and questions that had haunted her since her crossing over. "They deserve better than they get," she said at last, tracing a pattern in the condensation on the table. "From both angels and demons."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOTEyYWI4NjYwMTRhNjNiMTVlOTdmZTRkNWRmNzVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Axel watched her for a long moment, his expression unreadable. The silence stretched between them. Then he smiled again. "Well, they got better today, thanks to us. The mill will be running again, no more bandits harassing travelers, happy endings all around." He raised his cup again. "We make a good team, angel-face."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MDZiN2EyMGI3ZTQyYzU4MDY5ZmJiNzBkOGI4ZGZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">The nickname should have irritated her, but instead it brought an unexpected warmth to her cheeks. Before she could reply he rose from his seat with fluid grace. "Your bath will be getting cold," he said, nodding toward the door. "I had them add lavender oil." He winked, the gesture somehow both playful and intimate. "Good for relaxing tense angels."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNjlhMjJjMDZhZTQ0YjU5YjA0ZjIxNTc2YzA3ZTY4"><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, he was gone, the door closing softly behind him, leaving Argent alone with her thoughts once more - thoughts that had become unexpectedly complicated in his presence.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTAzNWVkMjViNTQ0ZmViMDdiZDY5ZGNiYTZjN2Nj"><span style="font-weight: 400">The bath was indeed wonderful. The lavender oil filled the small bathing chamber with its soothing scent, mingling with the steam that rose from the wooden tub. As she sank into the water, muscles she hadn't realized were tense began to unwind. She found herself wondering what it would be like to simply exist without purpose or mission, to experience the world not as an angel but just as herself. The thought was both liberating and terrifying.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMDlkODY3ZTlkOTQ0ZDFiMjdlZmVlZmZlYzQ1NTA3"><span style="font-weight: 400">By the time Argent emerged night had fallen completely. The rain had eased to a mist but a strange restlessness had taken hold of her, making the small room feel suddenly confining. There was a soft tap at the door. When she opened it, she found Axel leaning against the doorframe, a brown bottle dangling from his fingers. "Fancy a nightcap under the stars?" he asked, gesturing toward the inn's roof with the bottle.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MjllMmQ5YWVmZjQxYjRhNmI3NzQzMDdhNjZiMGQx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Argent raised an eyebrow, momentarily forgetting her inner turmoil. "On the roof?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NTBhMTRlOWQ4MTRlZmQ4YTgxMzBmZDBmYTkxMzI0"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Best view in town," he confirmed with a grin. "I checked while you were taking the world's longest bath."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NGVmZjY0YmI3YzQzNjI4ZmNlZjcyOTFjZGVkOWE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">She should say no. It was inappropriate, unnecessary, potentially dangerous. Her rational mind listed all the reasons to decline: he was a demon, she was an angel, they were natural enemies, she barely knew him, she couldn't trust his motives. But the thought of sitting alone in her room with only her doubts for company held no appeal, and something in Axel's expression made her hesitate. "Just for a little while," she agreed finally, the words surprising her even as she spoke them.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YWYwMWYyNTgwMTRkYTFiOGM5MDE3YjYzYTQxYTA5"><span style="font-weight: 400">"That's the spirit, angel-face." He gestured gallantly. “After you.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MzVmNDIwYmI5OTQ4ZWZhODc5M2Y0ZmNmOGZjNjlh"><span style="font-weight: 400">They climbed out through a window at the end of the hall, Axel going first to offer her a hand she didn't need but accepted anyway. The contact sent an unexpected shiver through her. His skin was warm, nearly hot to the touch in contrast to her chilled fingers.</span></p><span class="cjQ4ZmVjY2IwYzIzMzQ3YzhhZTA5MDA3ZTkyZTA0ZTcx"><br/>The story has been stolen; if detected on Amazon, report the violation.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM3ODgxYjRlYTZiMDQwYWY4NWM2MDYxZTJmZGJjMmNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">The roof was sloped but stable, the thatch providing decent footing despite the rain. They settled side by side in a sheltered corner, backs against the chimney, which still radiated heat from the day's fires. Above them, the roof creaked and moaned under the assault of the wind that had intensified throughout the evening. She wondered how much longer she could stay before her storm began to cause trouble for the town.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYmJkMmExOTc4YTRlNmE4N2Q5NDMxMDgzOTQxYTI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Axel seemed to sense her thoughts. He passed her the bottle, their fingers brushing momentarily. "It's not your fault, you know," he said quietly. "The storm. It's just part of who you are."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOTUwMzkyMzIyZDQ0ODg4ZGY0ODFjMmZhNjdkODdh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Argent took a long sip from the bottle, letting the burn of the alcohol distract her from the weight of his words. "That doesn't make it any less destructive," she replied, passing the bottle back.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTE2ODk1MTYxOTRlNjVhOWRiODQ0YWI5YzRmOWJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">"No," he agreed, surprising her with his honesty. "But it doesn't make you a monster either."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTRmNjAyNTM0MTRkMGZhMzE3NzZmYjVhODkyNTNk"><span style="font-weight: 400">The simple statement struck something deep within her. How long had it been since someone had spoken to her as a person, not as an angel or a weapon or a problem? The Council had always viewed her storm-bringing nature as a liability; a power to be controlled and directed, not understood or accepted.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOWRkZWEzMDk4OTQ1ZmRhYjdjM2I4OTM2YmM5ZmEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Do you ever miss it?" Axel asked suddenly, his voice barely audible. "Seeing a clear night sky? Feeling sunshine directly on your face?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNkODVjYzM5NDI1MDRiNTM4NzdlMjY1MGRiNzk0MGNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">The question caught Argent off guard, touching on longings she rarely allowed herself to acknowledge. She'd never spoken of such things with anyone. Her gaze lifted to the darkness above, seeing only the clouds of her own creation. "All the time," she admitted softly, the confession feeling like a tiny freedom. "I've seen brief glimpses. Shifts in the clouds. Breaks in the storm." She wrapped her arms around her knees, suddenly aware of how small she felt beneath the weight of the sky. "I've almost forgotten what it's like."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzODU2OTUzNmM2ZjRmNjBiMTViMGNiODk3ZDYzZWY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Now who's being melancholy?" Axel bumped his shoulder gently against hers, the contact sending a small spark through her. "This is a celebration, remember? Daring heist, grateful townspeople, evil bandits vanquished."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNjY0ODQyNmFmZjRmYzVhZGMzYmRmNDg2YmNhN2Jh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Argent smiled faintly, grateful for his attempt to lighten the mood. "Is that how you see it?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNmFjNjU1YzdiMTRkMjU5NjE5NWQ1ZDZmYTBmZGUy"><span style="font-weight: 400">"That's how I choose to see it," he corrected, taking another drink from the bottle. "Life's more interesting with a bit of narrative flair."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTQ2YThmZTU1MDQ0ZWI5MDI5OTA0NDFhMzFjNDNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">They fell into companionable silence, passing the bottle back and forth, watching the rain fall in silver sheets around them. It was strange, Argent thought, how comfortable she felt in that moment. A week ago, she would have found the idea of sharing wine with a demon under the stars absurd, even blasphemous. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5YzQxNjAzYjdkOTRmMDRiMjg5OTBhMmZiMTIwYjcx"><span style="font-weight: 400">The silence between them had transformed into a shared quiet that required no words to fill it. The rain seemed to cocoon them, creating a private world. "Can I see them?" Axel asked suddenly, his voice soft in the darkness.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTZmNGQ5NTc2ZjQ3N2RhZDE0Yzg4Y2UxMWQ0MmQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Argent's entire body went rigid, her breath catching painfully in her throat. The rain intensified violently, responding to her distress, hammering down in torrents that nearly drowned out the sound of her suddenly racing heart.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OTFkMjAzYmQ1MDQ3ZmY4YmI1ZTQxYTk1ZjA4ZTYz"><span style="font-weight: 400">She knew exactly what he meant. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">My wings.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNlODIwZjc1OTEyYTRkYWFhZDc2ZDU3YWZkZmNjM2U3"><span style="font-weight: 400">The request sent a jolt of terror through her so powerful that she nearly fled right then, scrambling off the roof and away from his curiosity. Memories flashed unbidden; clinical white rooms, restraints cutting into her skin, the sound of her own screaming as they explored the limits of her tolerance. Feathers torn, bones broken methodically, one by one, while dispassionate voices recorded her responses.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDI2NjAxZWUzYjQzMTBhMTAwZGE1MzY0MGE1MGM2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Argent realized she was trembling, her arms wrapped around herself defensively, fingers digging into her own flesh hard enough to bruise. The rain blew into their sheltered alcove, soaking through her clothes, plastering her hair to her head. Thunder crashed directly overhead.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYzFlOWMxNDU0MDRkMjdiZDViYjZhNTc1ZjFlZDc4"><span style="font-weight: 400">"N-no," she stammered, unable to hide the fear in her voice, hating how weak she sounded. "I'm sorry." She shifted away from him, her back pressing against the chimney as if to protect her hidden, damaged wings.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYzEwZTE1ZjdmMDRhNjA5YjU4NGRiZGM0Njc5ODE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Axel's expression changed immediately, concern replacing curiosity, followed by a dawning horror as he registered her reaction. "Argent," he said quietly, using her name instead of the usual teasing nickname. His hands remained carefully at his sides, making no move to breach the space she'd put between them. "What did they do to you?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YmMyMjE2NGQ0MTRhNjFiM2RmZjFlOWE1YzA4NDA1"><span style="font-weight: 400">She stared at him, caught between the instinct to flee and an unexpected urge to confide. The rain continued to pour, mirroring the storm inside her. In Axel's eyes, she saw not the pity she feared, but understanding, followed by a flash of something darker - anger, but not directed at her. He made no move to touch her, to offer empty comfort that would only remind her of her weakness. Instead, he simply settled back against the chimney, his gaze lifting to the storm-wracked sky, giving her the space she needed without abandoning her to her memories.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYzkzM2E3MzhkZDQwYTc5ZTU0YTA2ZGEyMGNlNjRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">"The night sky over the Scorched Plains is different from anywhere else," he offered after a moment, his voice casual, as if they'd simply been discussing travel destinations. "The stars burn redder there, and sometimes the air itself seems to shimmer with heat even after the sun sets. On the clearest nights, you can see twin moons. Most people think it's just an optical illusion, but it's actually the reflection of the true moon in the salt flats."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNjAwODFkYjQ4YjQ1NjI5ZDQ2ODUxNTZiMzY5YzEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">"I've never been to the Scorched Plains," she murmured, grabbing hold of the change of subject like a lifeline. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiMzY5YjM4ZTkzZTRkMGZhZDI0ZTkyMjM4Y2FkODdh"><span style="font-weight: 400">"I could take you sometime," he suggested casually. "Well, to the edges at least. Too hot for angels in the center, I'd imagine."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOTBmODE4NzgyNzRhMDI5NTgyYWRkMGRlMThmMjU5"><span style="font-weight: 400">The absurdity of the offer startled a soft laugh from her. Slowly, her trembling subsided, the rain gradually returning to its usual gentle fall. She uncurled slightly from her defensive posture, the painful tension in her muscles easing incrementally. "Maybe someday," she said, surprising herself with how much she meant it.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3M2E2YmU5NDlmYjRiNmRhMTUwNmViMjM2MTQxNzIx"><span style="font-weight: 400">The night deepened around them, leaving them in an island of calm. They made small talk about their travels, the different customs they’d encountered. It was normal conversation, the kind that friends might share, with nothing of the weight of their respective natures burdening it. Argent found herself speaking more freely than she had in decades. There was something liberating about talking to someone who had no preconceptions about her, no knowledge of her failures or the expectations she'd never quite fulfilled.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NjBhMzIyYzEwMTRhNWQ4NTEzMzQ3NTZjNzYzY2Jk"><span style="font-weight: 400">In turn, Axel revealed glimpses of himself beyond his carefree nature; a surprisingly deep knowledge of angelic literature, a genuine appreciation for the ingenuity of humans in the face of hardship. He spoke of places she'd never seen, adventures she'd never dared to have, with a storyteller's flair.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMjlhY2ZlNWU0ZjQzNjhiZDJiNWU5MDc0NTY4MzEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">When she could no longer keep her eyes open, the alcohol and the warmth of the chimney taking their toll, Argent allowed Axel to help her back through the window and to her door. They stood there for a moment, the hallway quiet around them. His eyes, in the dim light of the hall, seemed darker, more complex than the simple crimson she'd first noticed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMmIwODg3ZmE1NTQxYjFhNDc4NGZlZWExYWM0MDJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Goodnight, Axel," she said softly, ending the moment before it could become something more complicated.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZDk2NjQyN2MxNzRjZGNiMGVjZWVjMTI1ZTQ2Nzky"><span style="font-weight: 400">His smile held none of his usual teasing or bravado.. "Sweet dreams, angel-face," he replied.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0M2ZjYzYxOGM5NDRjZTU4ZDZhYTRjMDJmOGEwMjY2"><span style="font-weight: 400">She closed the door, leaning back against it, listening to his retreating footsteps. The room felt different somehow - smaller, emptier. Outside, her storm continued, but for the first time in memory, she imagined what it might be like if it didn't.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOTdjMjVkNzAxYTRkYjdhODkwODdmYmRkMjhkMDVi"> </p>
<hr/>
<p class="cnNlZWVjN2QwZWJmYzQ2ODFiYThjNjU1NzcxYTNjYTg1" style="text-align: center"> </p>
<p class="cnM2ZTE1OWM0YzhiNTRhZjc4OWQ0ZThjY2ZlM2RhMTFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Morning arrived, though one could hardly tell through the torrential downpour that had intensified overnight. The sheets on her bed were damp despite the sturdy roof, moisture seeming to permeate everything around her by her mere presence.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMjBiYjkyZWFjZDRiODM4ZWQyYWQyNjA2NGI4N2Vl"><span style="font-weight: 400">She'd done this too many times before, stayed just long enough to make a difference, only to have her nature threaten to undo all the good she'd accomplished. The machine part would be useless if the mill washed away in a flood of her creation.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MjE3MWUzNzUxYjQ5MTZiMmNmNGJhYjBhMzMyODlh"><span style="font-weight: 400">With practiced efficiency born of necessity, Argent packed her few belongings. Her clothes, never quite dry no matter how carefully she stored them, felt heavy and uncomfortable against her skin. As she fastened her cloak she allowed herself a moment of regret. Despite the storm, despite the danger, despite everything, she had enjoyed her time here. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxYWE5NmE1MGViZDQ3OTQ5ZjEyZDU0OGJkYzNiZWQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">She made her way downstairs, half expecting to find Axel in the common room, perhaps charming the innkeeper's daughter or enjoying a leisurely breakfast. But he wasn't there. The common room was nearly deserted, the few patrons present looking anxiously at the rising water outside.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNzYzMWE4N2Q1YTQ4M2E4NGQ1N2E2MTE0MTM1MmMw"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Your friend left before dawn," the innkeeper informed her when she asked, his expression distracted as he moved furniture to higher ground. "Paid for both rooms, left a message for you." He handed her a small package wrapped in simple cloth. Argent unwrapped it carefully, uncertain what to expect.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YjIzNzkzYzZmNTQ1ZWE4NDFjYWMyNTYyN2RhYTBi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Inside she found a glass orb no larger than a grape. Within it, a tiny sun seemed to float, radiating golden warmth that seeped into her fingers. For a moment Argent stared in disbelief as the orb pushed back the darkness of her storm, creating an island of perfect light amid the endless rain that had been her constant companion since her creation.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNmQ1NTkzYWQ1YzQ5MmI4NzY5MWFjZDk2YTc4YzA3"><span style="font-weight: 400">The orb's light touched her face, warm as a caress, brighter than the weak sunlight that occasionally filtered through her storms. It was like holding a piece of actual sunshine. A note accompanied it, scrawled in hasty but elegant script:</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMzhkNzkzYzhiZjQ0MDRhNjI4Zjc0NzQzNTNjZDBj"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Until next time, angel-face. Try not to miss me too much. -A</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNmNTAzNzMzNzNjZDRjNWQ5YzZjMWZkZDdkOWJhNmNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Argent stared at the miniature sun, a complex mixture of emotions churning within her. Relief, disappointment, confusion, and something warmer that she wasn't ready to name. The little orb created a sphere of dryness around it, as if forming a barrier against her endless storm. It was a small miracle of demon-craft that should have repelled her but instead felt like the most precious gift she'd ever received.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNjYzYWY4YjgyZDQ4NmM5NDY4MTUyMTg1OTMzMTJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Carefully, she tucked the orb into an inner pocket of her cloak, where the small glass sun burned warm and dry against her heart like a promise.</span></p>
