<p class="cnM3MzY5M2E4YThkMDQwNGI4ODM2NDRhYzYyMWNiNTE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">The world of Laios had always been stable. A single, gigantic continent of vast biomes for all kinds of life to flourish for thousands of years. From the burning sands of the Grand Desert to the arctic emptiness of the Glacial Expanse, the land remained largely unchanged… until the Mist began to seep across it, unnoticed and relentless. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiOThhOWVhZjI5MjRmMjk4ZGQ4ZDA1ZDZiNmQzYTAx"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Mist was insidious in its lethargy, taking more and more land over time and warping its inhabitants in wretched ways, leaving them alive but rotting inside, clinging to a hideous sort of half-life. Some adapted to the Mist, mutating, evolving into species that could handle its presence. Other species vanished entirely without notice. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyYThiZGY5NjBlMjQ5N2JiZTY4MjdkZGVmY2E0ZGU0"><span style="font-weight: 400">The humans who had made their societies in the ground and in the air—the Geovans and Zephyrians, respectively—had long since accepted the stability of their world and took no notice for a very long time, content with their lives. The Mist wasn’t a threat to them. Until, not-so-suddenly, it was at their doorstep, and the mana that the humans relied on so much began to falter. </span></p><span class="cmNiZGZmNWMxN2NkOTQzMzViMWIwNGM0MTVjYTIxN2Nl"><br/>Reading on this site?

<p class="cnM2MjEyOWI3YjAxZTRmZmQ5YzY1MzBjNGI1NDcwYTk5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Time had just about run out for the humans when sixteen-year-old Maeryn d’Vert led a team on a desperate journey to find answers, to find a solution. And despite the odds, she succeeded. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0NjQ3YjhkZjIzNDQ4ZmJiMDQ3NGM1ZDE3NTBmNjFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Mist’s true nature as necromantic-aligned mana was made known, and Maeryn’s team was able to create necromancy’s antithesis: holy mana. Arming their nations with </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Purify Mist </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">enchantments, Maeryn’s team saved humanity from extinction. For now. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1NTg5YmYzNzJkMDRhODliYzcxNzYxNGVjMmUxMDk2"><span style="font-weight: 400">But many questions lay unanswered. If the Mist was created by the Undead, where were those Undead now? Who had created them? When? Why? </span></p>
<p class="cnMyZjU3ZjFjNjUwMTQ4NjJiMjVmYTk4OGRlZDliYjk0"><span style="font-weight: 400">No one alive could say for sure. But if one knew where to look, whom to ask, the answers were there. Just waiting to be found. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzYzM3NTAyNzE3NTRhN2ZiM2NmZjNhZjRkYjUwNjQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Humanity had bought some time, but the Mist was still there, choking the land. If they were to ever be free of its grip, then they had no choice: it was time to hunt for answers. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzN2Y1YTZhYzkwMTRmNjVhNmZkODI1MmM1OTFmNTEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Before the answers found them. </span></p>
