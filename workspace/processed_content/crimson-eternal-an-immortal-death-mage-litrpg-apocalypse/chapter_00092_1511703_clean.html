   I have an important quiz I have to take tomorrow and to study for tonight and tomorrow, along with a meeting with a sponsor for my senior design project tomorrow after that.

   So there will only be one Crimson Eternal chapter tomorrow, and the second Crimson Eternal chapter today was canceled as well.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Most of the chapters for my other stories are canceled as well, but that doesn't affect most of you. Unless you read my other stories that is.

  This story originates from Royal Road. Ensure the author gets the support they deserve by reading it there.

   WBM and Reaper still get a chapter tomorrow though.

   Gonna be an unpleasant day for me :/

   The chapter I do post tomorrow will probably be the night chapter, skipping the noon one.

   By the way, I'm talking CST tomorrow. It's 12:36AM here.
