   </span>
   he scent of antiseptic hit Xin's nostrils as Lorna led him through Stardust Command's lower levels. Doctor Nikki walked ahead of them, her white lab coat contrasting the lighting. The corridor stretched before them, its titanium walls bearing the scuffs and scratches of past containments gone wrong.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Most of our guests don't stay long," Lorna said, her boots clicking against the polished floor. "We process them, study them if needed, then transfer them to more permanent facilities — if they aren't disposed of." She gestured to a row of empty cells, each secured by a shimmering containment field that cast a pale blue glow.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Nikki paused at a security terminal, typing on the holographic interface. "Except for our newest inmate here. He's proven particularly enlightening."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The cell they approached was larger than the others. Through its containment field, Xin could make out a hulking figure in the shadows. As they drew closer, his hand instinctively moved toward the 10mm Magnum on his belt.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Easy," Lorna said. "The field's quantum-locked. Even if the power fails, it'll hold for six hours."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin nodded, but the green Quantum Watch on his left wrist made an ominous beep as he rose it to eye level. "The resonance frequency is fluctuating."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I see you’ve noticed." Nikki sighed. "We've requested an upgrade to the harmonic stabilizers, but..." She shrugged. "budget cuts, thanks to the almighty Corporate Chamber. Been like that since year ‘93."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The figure in the cell stirred. Xin had to suppress a gasp.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A Valoran man — if he could still be called that — emerged. The former human's transformation was thorough. His skull had deformed, skin pulled taut over sharp bone ridges and deep furrows. Glowing red eyes burned in sunken sockets, and his lipless mouth revealed rows of metallic teeth. Gray, chitinous patches covered portions of the sickly brown skin on his naked form, and even in its flaccid state, his grossly enlarged phallus was terrifying.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A man made Draug through the Fenris variant of the Nucleus Virus.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Visitors?" The creature rasped. "How thoughtful of you. And who's this? Fresh meat?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "A new colleague," Lorna replied coolly. "Xin, meet Professor Mac Watrous. Former sociologist, current test subject. And terrorist scumbag."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin studied the transformed man. Tubes ran from the ceiling to a feeding port in the cell, delivering a steady drip of fluorescent green Helionite.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Tell me, Imperial," Watrous said, "has Agent Weiss shown you what happens to those who refuse treatment?" He pressed closer to the containment field. "Or perhaps she's told you how the Terra Alliance has failed to save the impoverished American people?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin noticed Lorna's jaw tighten.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That's enough, Professor," Nikki interjected, tapping notes into her tablet. "Your transformation has progressed faster than previous subjects. The cranial elongation alone—"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Progress?" Watrous laughed, a sound like grinding metal. "Doctor Nikki, this isn't progression. This is liberation." His glowing red gaze fixed on Lorna. "You know. You’ve felt it, haven't you? The power singing in your veins? The Nucleus Virus?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The air seemed to grow thicker. Xin glanced at Lorna, remembering what she’d been through in Taiwan. Her face remained impassive, but her hand had moved into the side pocket in her trench coat.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You guys get to watch international news down here?" Xin inquired in mock casualness. "Odd how a prisoner would know about —"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   One moment Watrous was standing still, the next he had hurled himself at the containment field. Lorna had already drawn the hilt of her Psytum Sword, pushing Xin behind her with her other arm.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It’s in her smell," Watrous sneered, the claws on his deteriorating hands leaving trails of electricity where they scraped the barrier. "All who’re infected with same strain can sense each other. But I sense the one in you has been pacified. Why would you deny such a blessing?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That's none of your concern, Professor," Nikki cut in sharply, but Xin caught the flash of pain across Lorna's face.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Watrous pressed his elongated face against the field. "Everything is relevant, Doctor. The virus doesn't just change our bodies. It reveals what we truly are." His red eyes found Xin again. "She could have been like me. Beautiful. Perfect. But she chose to remain limited."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The feeding tube above hissed, dispensing another dose of Helionite. Watrous caught the liquid in his mouth, and Xin watched in horrified fascination as the professor's wounds from the barrier instantly healed.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Why do you keep him alive? This…monster," Xin whispered to Lorna.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Ask me yourself, Imperial," Watrous called out. "Or better yet, ask Dr. Chakraborty why she's so interested in my 'condition'. Tell him, Doctor. Tell him about the others."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Nikki's tablet creaked under her grip. "As a Draug, Professor Watrous represents our first opportunity to study the complete transformation process in a subject with high psionic potential. If we can understand the virus's progression, we might finally develop a vaccine to eradicate —"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Eradicate?" Watrous's metallic laugh echoed off the walls. "How typically Alliance. Always trying to destroy what you don't understand." His naked form pressed against the barrier, red eyes gleaming. "They need me. Every test, every sample, every failure brings them no closer to their precious cure. At least the Imperium admits they want to control us." He bared his metallic teeth in a mockery of a smile.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna shifted. "We're done here," she said, her voice hard. But as they turned to leave, Watrous called after them.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Imperial! Ask your new colleagues why they're so desperate for a cure! Ask Agent Weiss what she saw when the virus sang in her veins. When she finally shows you what she really bears, remember this moment!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The walk back felt longer than their descent. Xin's mind raced, processing Watrous's words.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "So, the containment field," he finally said. "The resonance frequency is…off. The whole quantum stabilization grid is running on legacy protocols. In case you're curious, it means one power surge and — "
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "We know, Mister Wu. We know," Nikki interrupted, her heels clicking faster now. "But SIMU's funding keeps getting diverted to combat equipment and espionage. The Corporate Chamber thinks — "
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "They think we're glorified pest control," Lorna finished. She hadn't holstered the hilt of her sword. "Until the next Radi-Mon outbreak hits, we're only useful for fighting Imperium and Directorate armies."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   They reached the Quantum Lift. As the doors slid shut, Xin noticed Lorna's left hand drift to her abdomen, her posture shifting ever so slightly. The subtle curl of her shoulders, the way she leaned against the elevator wall – he recognized the stance from his cousin's morning sickness years ago.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Are you alright?" he asked quietly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna's eyes met his in the elevator's reflection. Something flickered across her face – hesitation, perhaps fear – before she straightened her spine.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It's nothing," she forced a smile. "Had too much breakfast, I guess."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The doors opened to the main level, and Nikki stepped out first, already buried in her own thoughts. But before Lorna could follow, Xin caught her arm.
  </span>

 <p>
  <span>
   "If you’re feeling unwell," he said. "we can skip the shooting practice today."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She looked at his hand on her arm, then at his face. A ghost of a smile crossed her lips. "I’m fine. See you at 11."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She walked away, leaving him in the Lift with the phantom sensation of her warmth beneath his fingers, and the echoing memory of Watrous's red eyes.

  <span>
   Combat Training Facility, Stardust Command, Evanston, IL
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The harsh lights of the combat training facility cast a glare across the blue mats. Xin picked himself up from the floor for what felt like the hundredth time. His body trembled with exhaustion, limbs aching from repeatedly hitting the mat.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Again," Thomas commanded, his cybernetic arms gleaming under the lights. The silver appendages whirred softly as he reset his stance, watching Xin's movements.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin swallowed, tasting blood where his lip had split. Purple bruises covered his forearms, standing out against his olive skin. His thin frame in the standard SIMU training gear looked small compared to Thomas's imposing build.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I'm starting to think you enjoy the taste of mat," Thomas said, sweat glistening on his face. "Come on. One more time."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, leaving a blood streak as Thomas's expression hardened.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yo, Tom, babying the new guy again?" Emmanuel walked into the training room, his locs swaying with each step. He leaned against the wall, arms crossed. "You know Director Otis wants a full assessment by noon."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Thomas shook his head. "I'm trying, Manny. But Xin here seems to think SIMU is a tech convention."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Thomas's cybernetic fingers flexed with a soft whir. "One more demonstration. Pay attention this time."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Before Xin could brace himself, Thomas lunged forward. Xin tried to dodge as he'd been shown, but moved too slowly. Thomas's metal hand grabbed Xin's wrist, applying pressure.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A crack echoed through the room.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin screamed a moment later. He fell to his knees, holding his broken wrist against his chest, his face twisted in pain.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Shit," Thomas muttered, kneeling beside Xin. "Didn't mean to break anything."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   From his pocket, Thomas pulled out a small Medi-Vap dispenser with sea-green liquid inside.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Open up," Thomas said, his tone softer. "This will fix you, but it's gonna hurt for a few seconds, okay?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Right…" Xin opened his mouth, pain making his eyes water. Thomas placed the dispenser between Xin's lips and pressed the button. A hiss followed, and Xin's lungs filled with a cool vapor that glowed in his mouth.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As Xin breathed out the glowing mist, a burning feeling spread through his body, centering on his wrist. The pain got worse briefly, making him whimper before fading to a dull throb, then nothing. The bruises on his skin lightened and disappeared. His split lip healed, and his whole body felt lighter.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Thomas helped Xin to his feet, his cybernetic hand now gentle. "Better?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin moved his wrist, finding it completely healed. "Yeah...thanks."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Thomas stepped back, running a hand through his short blonde hair, looking frustrated but somewhat respectful. "Look, Xin, you're simply no soldier, minus the determination part. But determination alone doesn't make a soldier."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Emmanuel pushed off from the wall and approached them. "That's the third bone you've broken this week, Mendoza. Maybe ease up a little?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Combat doesn't ease up. The Radi-Mons and Imperium bastards out there don't give us second chances," Thomas replied, meeting Emmanuel's gaze.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Emmanuel put a hand on Xin's shoulder. "How about we try something with a bit more distance? See if you can handle guns better than fists."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Thomas's mechanical fingers whirred as he crossed his arms. "It'd take months of training before he'd be remotely useful in melee anyway." His tone softened as he spoke to Xin. "You'd really be better off in the tech division. Why so hell-bent on field work?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin straightened up, meeting Thomas's eyes despite being shorter. "I want to make a difference. Didn't leave the Imperium to hide behind computer screens."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   After a moment of silence, Thomas nodded curtly. "It's a free country." He turned to Emmanuel. "He's all yours."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As Thomas headed for the exit, his cybernetic arms caught the light, a reminder of what some sacrificed for SIMU. At the door, he paused. "Try not to teach him those Maridian voodoo of yours. Paperwork's a bitch."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "No promises, man," Emmanuel laughed as Thomas left. "Come on, skinny," he said to Xin, pointing toward the weapons range. "Let's see if you can handle something that bites back."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Thomas said something about…voodoo?" Xin asked.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "My family's from a line of witchdoctors in the Directorate. Sumina, we call them." Emmanuel flexed his arms as they walked to the other side of the room. "It's mentally straining for anyone to learn them. I'd have to fill out tons of paperwork before Director Otis would let me teach you."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Emmanuel led Xin through double doors into the weapons range. The room smelled of gun oil and ozone – the scent of kinetic weapons firing in an enclosed space.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Ever shot one of these before?" Emmanuel took a sleek white-blue submachine gun from the wall rack. The weapon hummed to life at his touch, status lights blinking along its barrel.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Nope," Xin shook his head. "Just handguns."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "This ain't your standard-issue piece." Emmanuel handled the weapon with familiarity. "Kuma here's a Kinetic SMG. Uses electromagnets instead of conventional propellants. Quieter, cleaner, deadlier."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin kept staring at the weapon. "So about that voodoo—"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Focus, skinny," Emmanuel cut him off, tapping the gun. "One lesson at a time."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He stepped to the firing line, bringing the SMG to his shoulder smoothly. The targets downrange – humanoid silhouettes – lit up as the range activated.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Stance is everything," Emmanuel demonstrated, feet shoulder-width apart. "Weight forward, grip firm but not too tight."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Three quick bursts from the SMG, each with a low electronic whine instead of a bang. The center target's head and chest showed precise groupings.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Looks easy, right?" Emmanuel grinned, handing the weapon to Xin. "Your turn."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin took the SMG carefully. It was lighter than expected, but still had weight. He copied Emmanuel's stance, bringing the stock to his shoulder.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Straighten your back," Emmanuel corrected. "Elbow down. Yeah, like that."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin pulled the trigger.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The recoil hit him hard. The SMG jumped upward, shots going wild above the target. Xin stumbled backward, almost falling.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Whoa, easy!" Emmanuel steadied him. "Shorter bursts. Don't fight the climb, control it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin nodded and tried again. This time, the shots at least hit near the target, though far from the center.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Better," Emmanuel encouraged. "Again."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Six attempts later, Xin lay flat on his back, staring at the ceiling, the SMG on his chest. His arms burned from controlling the weapon, and his shoulder hurt where the stock had repeatedly hit it.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I guess this isn't working," he said with a self-mocking smile.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Emmanuel squatted beside him. "Everybody sucks at first." He reached for the SMG. "Here, let me—"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As his fingers touched the weapon and Xin's hand at the same time, something strange happened. The SMG's status lights flickered rapidly, cycling through colors before turning green – a color the weapon had never shown before.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Emmanuel froze, his expression changing from casual to intensely curious.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The hell?" He picked up the SMG, examining it closely.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Something wrong?" Xin propped himself up.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Emmanuel ignored the question and put the weapon back in Xin's hands. "Hold this a second."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The green lights flickered again, though less dramatically.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Huh. Void attunement." Emmanuel looked at him calculatingly. "You ever been tested for psionic potential?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "No," Xin sat up fully. "The Imperium tracks everyone who takes those tests. My family told me never to do it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "So you've never been diagnosed or suspected?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "No," Xin shook his head. "Why?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Emmanuel took the SMG back, the lights returning to their normal blue. "Kuma here's got a psionic core. It's usually blue since I'm Lunar-attuned. But it just... reacted to you."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Which means?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Means you might be what we call a Latent." Emmanuel sounded thoughtful. "Psionic potential that never awakened."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin's heart raced. "I can learn magic?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It's not magic. Just 'fancy ways to manipulate atoms.'" Emmanuel helped him up. "Some Latents never awaken. Others need a... catalyst."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What kind of catalyst?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Exchanging your Aether with someone else's. There's several ways to do it." Emmanuel paused, grinning slyly. "Sexual connection with an active psionic is one of the most effective."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin blushed at the suggestion.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Just kidding." Emmanuel chuckled as he stepped back. "Should see that look on your face."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Right, right. Only jokes, huh?" Xin pushed his glasses up, laughing awkwardly, but noticed Emmanuel's smile didn't reach his eyes.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Anyway," Emmanuel continued, putting the SMG back on the rack, "SMGs ain't your thing. Stick to what you discussed with Lorna."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Right. The 10mm." Xin nodded, smiling slightly at the mention of their earlier conversation.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Emmanuel laughed knowingly as he patted Xin's shoulder. "She's been planning this since getting out of medical. Fair warning, though – she's tougher than both of us combined."
  </span>
