   When Emma stepped outside with her dragon, she was greeted with a sight that made her eye twitch. Karlack stood next to a muddy little girl whose dress and face was covered. Sure, the dress wasn’t the nicest thing in the world, but looking at it in this ruined state, Emma could only frown.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The vampire looked towards Karlack. “I thought you were in charge of cleaning things, not making them dirty.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Karlack—the bastard sword—shrugged. “This version of Sora is much cleaner, I think. I find that mud has a cleansing effect.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “Oh,” Emma said, her eye twitching even more. “Is that so?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Sora laughed and shook her dress up and down, flinging mud onto Emma’s dress.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The vampire screeched and lurched forwards, grabbing Sora before she could splash more mud onto her. She picked the girl up, pressing the muddy girl against her. “How did you get so dirty?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Sora laughed and pointed towards the horse kennels. “I was playing around with Arrow, and I was trying to find a flower for you.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “You were trying to find a flower for me? In the horse kennels?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The little girl nodded and pressed her two pointer fingers down. She looked down shyly and awkwardly, using the devilish technique that prickled at Emma’s heart. “I wasn’t sure what kind of flower you would like.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma gritted her teeth and looked away towards the grinning dragon. “What’s so funny with you? You know I’m mad at you, too.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “Oh my…” The dragon placed a hand over her mouth in an exaggerated motion. “The terrifying vampire mother is going to attack me.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma frowned, her face glowing beet red. She turned towards Karlack and pointed a finger at her, mouthing some words towards the bastard maid sword.

   The vampire carried Sora into the inn, towards the large baths. When she thought about it, this was a blessing in disguise. She’d not had the chance to bathe herself in warm water in so long. Emma found herself wrapping her arms around Sora protectively, not letting the girl’s mud drip onto the floor.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Sora returned the gesture and clung happily onto the vampire. By the time they reached the baths, the little girl was beaming.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma found that it was hard to stay mad at the little girl’s smile. Luckily, they were able to get a good inn using the endless pockets of their dragon. Nobody said anything to the two girls as they entered one of the bathing stalls.

   The vampire sighed and put the little girl on the wooden boards. “We’re going to have to wash you off before you can get into the water. Why would you go and do something like this anyway? Did Karlack put you up to it?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Sora started taking off her clothes with the assistance of Emma, and she sat down on a small wooden bucket. “Karlack is a good person...sword…”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma frowned as she found a small magic sprinkler. A small press of a blue button, and it sprayed out warm water. “I wasn’t asking what kind of person she was. I was asking if she put you up to it.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The little girl sat still as Emma began rinsing her body off of the mud. “I just wanted you to pay attention to me.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma raised an eyebrow and peered over Sora’s shoulder to her face. The little girl seemed content to just let the water wash over her. “What do you mean?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “It’s not what it sounds like. I wanted to see what it would look like if you got mad at me.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “You what? Why would you want me to get mad at you?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The little girl shrugged as more mud ran underneath them and slid inside of a long drain in the floor.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma realized she hadn’t gotten a change of clothes for herself or the little girl, but considering she could summon clothes with ice magic, she probably wouldn’t need to get clothes.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Finally, the little girl answered. “I love you, and I want you to take care of me. But Karlack said...She said that my parents would want me to play. I didn’t want to make things hard for you, but I want my mama and papa to smile.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma’s eyes widened as she finished washing the mud from the little girl’s body. It was now that she remembered Sora was so little. She was only 10 years old, yet she was always trying her best for Emma’s sake. Even at her worst, she was still a really good girl. Compared to all of the other children that Emma had met, Sora was like a dream for a parent.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   A small smile tugged at Emma’s lips. She understood why Sora had called Karlack a good person.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma breathed a small sigh and pulled up another bucket. “You want to rinse me off too?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Sora whipped around with a grin on her face and took the magic sprinkler from Emma’s hand. “Do frozen vampires melt from hot water?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma laughed as she sat on the bucket. “There is only one way to find out.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Sora mimicked what Emma had done and pressed the blue button. She sprayed water over Emma’s head, and the vampire felt the mud run through her hair like some type of natural conditioner.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   It took much less time for Emma’s body to come clean as she had less mud, and soon, the two were sitting inside of the wooden bathtub. The vampire grabbed some soap from a nearby basin and helped Sora scrub her body.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “I’m sorry if I’ve been mean to you,” Emma said.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Sora shook her head and closed her eyes, preventing the soap from running through them. “I know you didn’t mean it. You’re a good person.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “I’m really not. I’ve considered a lot of horrible things.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “It doesn’t matter what you considered. It matters what you did for me, and I will never forget how you protected me. One day...I will protect you the same way.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma sighed as she washed Sora’s hair. “You need to stop acting like an adult. There is nothing great about growing up. Otherwise, you’ll be like me and end up having to clean the hair of a little girl who followed the words of a bratty maid.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Sora laughed and stood up Emma’s lap. “By the time I grow up, we will have our own castle full of bratty maids just like Karlack!”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma frowned at that idea and stopped her. “I sincerely hope we don’t have anymore maids like Karlack!” The vampire quickly changed the subject as she led Sora out of the tub. “Rather than that, why kind of outfit would look good on you?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “I want to be a fairy!”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “A fairy…”
