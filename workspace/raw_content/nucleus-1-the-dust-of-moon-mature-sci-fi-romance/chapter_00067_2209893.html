<p class="cnNiZmNkYWM5OWViNDRhYzQ5OWE2NzNjMTk4MjlkMjhm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As <em>Nucleus </em>approaches its 50th chapter, I've been analyzing how to enhance your reading experience while working Royal Road's ecosystem. </span><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">After some research (and a bit of algorithm sleuthing...it's what I do, yeah?), I've decided to try something new with longer chapters.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MDQzMWE3ODNjMDRkZDRhYjgwOWY1YjY1NjA1NmRl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Starting with Chapter 50, when a chapter exceeds 4,000 words, I'll be splitting it into two scenes with a <strong>two-hour gap</strong> between releases. This means:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Scene 1 will arrive at the usual time (5pm CEST / 11am ET / 8am PT)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Scene 2 will follow approximately 2 hours later</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Both scenes will still release on the same day</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="cnM1MzIzY2ZlOGVlNTQ4NWRhMmE1M2FhOTNiOTAyZjQ5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Why the change? It turns out this approach offers benefits for both casual and dedicated readers. The 2-hour window gives everyone enough time to digest Scene 1 without waiting until next week for the conclusion. Meanwhile, it helps Nucleus appear twice on Royal Road's Latest Updates list, potentially introducing this series to new readers.</span></p><span class="cjVmMzcyMTYwNmZjNDRiNjdhOTNjMmMwNWZiNDRjMWU4"><br/>The author's tale has been misappropriated; report any instances of this story on Amazon.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM4Njc2ZjZjZTQzNDRkMTBiNmRjMmVhMTljNTA5OTVl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Is this gaming the system? Perhaps a tiny bit! </span></p>
<p class="cnMwOGEzZWE3MTAwZTQ0YTk5YjEwZDY2MWQ1MDEyYzc4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">But really, it's about finding the sweet spot that respects your time while maximizing this story's visibility in an increasingly crowded space.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYTlmYmNhZmVkNDRiOTNhYmY0YmUzMTM1NmIzOGRj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Our release schedule remains the same otherwise -- just with this small adjustment to how longer chapters are delivered. As always, I'm grateful for your continued support as we journey through the Five Realms together.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMGQ1Y2ZkYzc5NjRjYTQ4OWY2NjU4ZmY1NDYwODRl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">What do you think of this approach? Let me know in the comments, and I look forward to your reactions to Chapter 50 and beyond!</span></p>
