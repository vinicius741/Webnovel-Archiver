   Chapter 33

<p>
</p>
<p>
  "This," Ken said a while later, while Jessie, Sparkle, Penny, and I ate the last bites of our lunch, "is one of the most complicated ritual circles I've ever seen. And I've seen a lot."
 </p>
<p>
  The four of us were sitting at the little table beside the fireplace, which had a small but cozy fire crackling in it, Sparkle and I on one side, Jessie and Penny on the other. Ken was leaning against the butcher block island with the legal pad in hand, flipping back and forth through the pages.
 </p>
<p>
  "I have to compliment you on your note-taking, Ms. Rhodes," Ken added. "You were comprehensive."
 </p>
<p>
  She shrugged. "That little glowing ball led me to three different books on ritual magic, then a slim little hand-written notebook with that circle in it. Figured I'd better get it all down in one place." She flashed me a brief, wicked grin. "And since I did it, you didn't actually try to find out what he learned. God, I love abusin' Sidhe loopholes. It's so satisfyin'."
 </p>
<p>
  "Regardless," Ken said, coming over and setting the pad down on the table, "you did an excellent job. Thank you."
 </p>
<p>
  "Thank ya kindly," Jessie said with a nod. "Granny made sure I knew how to take good notes. Any idea what it's for?"
 </p>
<p>
  Ken made a face. "That's the weird thing," he said, tapping the complex circle on the final page. "This is a lot of work, but it's nothing particularly earth-shaking. As far as I can tell, it's an old ritual for breaking wards and preventing magical fallout in the wake of a promise being broken by another party. Useful, but…" He shrugged. "Why Oberon would put such value on it is beyond my ken."
 </p>
<p>
  "Pun intended," I said.
 </p>
<p>
  "Always," Ken said with a smile.
 </p>
<p>
  Jessie looked back and forth between us blankly.
 </p>
<p>
  Ken sighed. "The name Caley gave me when she took ownership of the Hall. Ken. She took it from the old English
  <em>
   cennan
  </em>
  , or 'to ken' in modern parlance. It means 'to make known' or 'to understand.'"
 </p>
<p>
  Jessie gave me an approving look. "Good name for a fella who's supposed to teach you and help you out around the house."
 </p>
<p>
  I smiled. "Thank you."
 </p>
<p>
  I looked back up at Ken. "So what's vexing you about this ritual circle?"
 </p>
<p>
  He frowned down at the pad. "I know I haven't taught you a lot about ritual magic yet, but the structure of this circle is…for lack of a better term, it's
  <em>
   aggressive
  </em>
  . That's unusual for ritual circles. And its use case is awfully specific, which…it's not unusual for ritual circles, but…"
 </p>
<p>
  I turned my attention back to the pad, flipping back to the ritual circle. It was made up of two large concentric circles, one inside the other, intersected by the outer edges of three smaller circles in a triangle pattern.
 </p>
<p>
  Ken tapped the pad. "Look at the wording in the outer circles. Latin, Hebrew, and Gaelic, one in each of the outer circles, but each one says the same thing, over and over again: 'Open the doors. Tear down the walls. Break the chains that bind.'"
 </p>
<p>
  "That is pretty aggressive," Jessie agreed. "But from what Granny taught me, there's lots of different ways to break wards. Why go to all this trouble?"
 </p>
<p>
  Ken shook his head. "I have no idea. I'm not an expert in ward-breaking." He sighed. "I'll look into it, though."
 </p>
<p>
  "Think I could take a copy back to my bosses at the UNSDI?" Jessie asked hopefully. "Not only could we call this even and transactional that way, so nobody gets in trouble, but as overblown a ritual as this is, it's apparently a real rarity. Somethin' like this shouldn't be lost, even if it's only of academic interest."
 </p>
<p>
  I looked at Ken, who shrugged. "I don't see why not," I said, then silently cast a simple object duplication spell. A moment later an identical legal pad sat next to the original, complete with Jessie's dense, blocky writing on it.
 </p>
<p>
  "Damn, that's cool," she said. "Thank you."
 </p>
<p>
  I smiled. "It can't duplicate complex objects yet, but a legal pad? No problem."
 </p>
<p>
  Jessie smiled, "I gotta say, Caley, I've seen some amazing places in my life so far, but I ain't never been anywhere as magical as this. I also gotta say, it has been years since I ain't been able to trust my sense of distance and direction like this. I could spend years explorin' this place, but it surely does make me feel weird."
 </p>
<p>
  I laughed. "Well, you said you're able to navigate Faerie without much trouble…I'm sure you'd adjust to the Hall after a while."
 </p>
<p>
  "Once it got to know me and trust me, I think," she said. "I keep gettin' the impression it's watchin' me right close to make sure I don't mean no harm. But I can see why you love this place, and I believe I'm gettin' a dim idea of why it needs protectin'. I won't tell my bosses nothin' about what I've seen here unless you okay it first."
 </p>
<p>
  I gave her a warm smile. "That means a lot to me."
 </p>
<p>
  She waved it off with a dismissive gesture, before taking a sip of the glass of soda she'd collected from the fridge. "It ain't free," she said, then met my eyes. "But we can talk about that after you tell me what you want me to help you with."
 </p>
<p>
  I ate the last bite of my sandwich, debating. Glancing around, I saw that neither Sparkle nor Penny seemed particularly concerned. And Ken, still standing by the table, looked more curious than worried. Apparently, the past couple of hours had cemented their trust in Jessie Rhodes too.
 </p>
<p>
  I met Ken's eyes and lifted an eyebrow. He nodded slightly.
 </p>
<p>
  I returned my attention to Jessie, who just smiled blandly as if she hadn't seen the whole silent exchange. "Oberon," I said, "indicated that I ought to firm up the borders of Faeflight before too much time passed. That I should find and walk the borders to cement them in place, I guess. Something about my nature as a human changing the nature of the land in Faerie."

<p>
  Jessie made a sound of agreement. "Trust me, as someone who lived in Faerie for either 12 or 32 years, dependin' on how you look at it, nobody gets that more than me. I think what you walkin' the boundaries of your land in Faerie will do is cement their connection to the real world. That way, time won't go wonky in Faeflight, and you won't find the borders of Summer and Winter encroachin' on yours more than they already do. It's crack-brained, but makes perfect sense at the same time. That's Faerie in a nutshell."
 </p>
<p>
  "I want to hire your services as a wayfinder to help me find and walk those borders," I said. "Entirely independent of your work for or any deals I make with the UNSDI. Based on what I saw during Shine's race, it might be dangerous, but I get the distinct impression you can handle yourself in a fight."
 </p>
<p>
  Jessie smiled slowly, nodding. "Yeah, that's what I was expectin'. And I'd be right happy to help you with that, for a variety of reasons, not least bein' it sounds like fun. But it'll cost ya."
 </p>
<p>
  "Name it," I said, "and we can haggle."
 </p>
<p>
  Her smile turned into a smirk. "No hagglin'. For that and keepin' any secrets about the Hall you want kept, I want citizenship in Faeflight."
 </p>
<p>
  That set me back on my heels for a moment, surprising me completely. When I glanced around, Ken and Penny were both nodding thoughtfully, and Sparkle looked straight-up approving of the idea.
 </p>
<p>
  "That's an awfully open-ended deal," I said carefully.
 </p>
<p>
  "I want that citizenship right badly," Jessie said honestly.
 </p>
<p>
  "Why?" Ken asked, coming to stand beside the table again, folding his arms. Sparkle and Penny both looked curious now as well.
 </p>
<p>
  Jessie sat back in her chair and sighed. When she spoke, I noticed that her accent had gotten thicker again. "This is somethin' only Gabriel, Mika and Vlad know about me…so me sharin' it with you four should tell ya somethin' about how I feel about you." She looked around at us. "I ain't got no real friends. I got bosses - and they're good bosses, mind ya, really good - and co-workers, most of whom I'd trust with my life. But…I want some real
  <em>
   friends
  </em>
  . People who like me for me, not for what I can do for 'em, and them for me."
 </p>
<p>
  She sighed heavily. "And y'all ain't got no idea how hard that is for me, havin' grown up in Faerie. They don't
  <em>
   do
  </em>
  friends. Just business partners." She looked around at us again. "Y'all are nice folks, and you're all
  <em>
   weird
  </em>
  , the same way I am. Same way Gabriel, Mika, and Vlad are, come to it, but they're my bosses, which puts a damper on things. I owe them for takin' me in, gettin' my head straight, teachin' me about the real world…but they're all a lot older than me, and have authority over me, and…friendly as they are, they still try to keep things professional." She shrugged. "Y'all get what I'm sayin'?"
 </p>
<p>
  "I think so," I said.
 </p>
<p>
  "Good," she said with a wry smile, "'cause I don't feel like I'm makin' no sense. Lemme cut to the chase. Summer and Winter - the Seelie and Unseelie Courts, not the law firm - both want my head. They couldn't touch Granny 'till she used me as a weapon to get revenge on one of Mab's pet courtiers, and now they know they ain't never gonna control
  <em>
   me
  </em>
  the way they wanted to control her. And if you can't control a weapon…" She trailed off.
 </p>
<p>
  "You destroy it," Ken said softly. "That is definitely in line with what I know of how the Sidhe courts operate."
 </p>
<p>
  "Workin' for the UNSDI has kept them from comin' for me," Jessie continued, "'cause they don't wanna piss off Gabriel O'Connell. Last time a Sidhe Lord did that, they found themselves suckin' on the barrel of Gabe's revolver, and he carries this big-ass old centerfire LeMat monstrosity. Dunno if you know the gun…"
 </p>
<p>
  We all shook our heads.
 </p>
<p>
  She huffed a little laugh. "It's ugly as sin with a grip that looks designed to break your hand. Nine-shot .44 caliber cylinder, and a centerline chamber that takes a 20 gauge shotgun shell. Gabe loaded that bitch up with blessed iron birdshot that he soaked in a solution of St. John's-wort, hawthorn, and foxglove. Didn't see it myself, but I understand that Sidhe Lord's head exploded like an overripe melon."
 </p>
<p>
  Sparkle had gone pale, and Penny winced. Ken whistled softly. "That would certainly do the trick."
 </p>
<p>
  "Any one of those things would've done the trick," Jessie said. "Gabe, he believes in the old sayin' 'There's no kill like overkill.' So the Sidhe courts try to leave him and the UNSDI the hell alone. But that don't make it safe for me to go back into Faerie."
 </p>
<p>
  She looked directly into my eyes. "I ain't gonna stop workin' for the UNSDI, it's a good job and I like it, but makin' a little home in Faeflight, under your umbrella, that'd let me go home again without havin' to worry about gettin' ganked by some wanna-be Sidhe assassin. I kinda miss roamin' the Ways when I need to clear my head."
 </p>
<p>
  "And…" Jessie looked around at us again, then finished very softly, "y'all are the sorta folks I'd like to have as friends. D.T. too."
 </p>
<p>
  I smiled. "I'm glad to hear that. I'd very much like to be your friend."
 </p>
<p>
  Sparkle and Penny both spoke up in agreement.
 </p>
<p>
  Ken nodded slowly, then sighed. "Much as it pains me to sound mercenary about you making a new friend, Caley, it would also send a distinct message to the Courts if you allowed Ms. Rhodes to make her home in Faeflight and be associated with Oakwood Hall."
 </p>
<p>
  "I ain't nobody's enforcer," Jessie said warningly.
 </p>
<p>
  Ken smiled grimly. "But if you become a citizen of Faeflight, would you not take up arms in its defense?"
 </p>
<p>
  Jessie blinked, then nodded slowly. "'Course I would. Point taken."
 </p>
<p>
  "I'm not sure I understand," I said carefully.
 </p>
<p>
  "Ken's sayin'…bottom line, on my own - even wearin' a UNSDI badge - I'm just dangerous prey. But bein' formally attached to another power in Faerie means there's consequences for comin' after me," Jessie said. "And, in turn, consequences for comin' for Faeflight. Y'all just got thrown into the deep end of a pond full'a some mighty big fish…might be you could use a pet shark to swim with."
 </p>
<p>
  Her metaphor wasn't so much mixed as blended and stewed, but it got the point across.
 </p>
<p>
  "It's a mutually beneficial arrangement," Sparkle piped in. "A very well-balanced one."
 </p>
<p>
  "If a potentially aggressive one," Penny said thoughtfully. "Which is not a bad thing, mind you. The Sidhe respect strength…You've demonstrated to Oberon that you're clever, quick-witted, and not an easy mark. Giving shelter to Ms. Rhodes -"
 </p>
<p>
  "C'mon, y'all, call me Jessie," Jessie interjected, a little desperately. "Please?"
 </p>
<p>
  Penny smiled. "Giving the mortal equivalent of political shelter to Jessie would in turn tell Oberon that you know the Sidhe are potentially dangerous to you…and you're taking that seriously. It might actually be taken as a sign of respect for them."
 </p>
<p>
  Sparkle nodded. "The High Sidhe are weird that way."
 </p>
<p>
  "An' lemme be perfectly clear," Jessie said, "to make sure there ain't no misunderstandin's…my friendship and any deals you make with the UNSDI ain't contingent on me bein' a citizen of Faeflight. I'd like to be your friend either way, and I think you'd be right smart to work out somethin' mutually beneficial with my bosses. But you'd be doin' me personally a right huge favor lettin' me make a home in your little Faerie kingdom, and it's the price for hirin' me to help you cement your borders, so to speak."
 </p>
<p>
  "In a realm where monsters are common," Ken said softly, "having your own monster could be a good thing."
 </p>
<p>
  Jessie huffed. "Ain't sure I like bein' called a monster, but you ain't wrong either. The High Sidhe sure do seem to think I'm the boogeyman."
 </p>
<p>
  "You're a mortal who grew up in Faerie," Sparkle said softly. "You've learned Fae secrets, you're practically humming with Fae magic, and you're the named successor of a Sidhe Lady who was as close to a spirit of rebellion and freedom as the Sidhe can produce. Of course you frighten them."
 </p>
<p>
  We all considered that in silence for a moment, before Jessie smiled a little and said, "Yeah, Granny would've liked that. And I suppose I can live with it."
 </p>
<p>
  "And this won't cause you any problems with your bosses?" I asked.
 </p>
<p>
  Jessie smiled slyly. "They never told me not to." She laughed softly. "But seriously, it shouldn't. About the worst thing this could do is make stronger ties between you and them eventually."
 </p>
<p>
  I glanced at Ken, who shrugged and nodded.
 </p>
<p>
  "Well," I said briskly, mind made up, "I suppose we should take you to meet Spice and Shine, since they're the ones running things for me in Faeflight."
 </p>
<p>
  Jessie blew out a relieved breath and smiled at me. A genuine, warm, eyes-sparkling smile. "Thank you, Caley. It's funny…after more than a decade of wantin' to come home to the mortal world, now I'm lookin' forward to goin' home to Faerie."
 </p>
<p>
  I smiled, rising from the table. "Not that strange at all, really. Possibly the most important thing I've learned in the last year is that what feels like 'home' isn't always where or what you expected it to be."
