   Emma stared down at the magic bracelet gracing her wrist. The moment she cast the spell, the dragon and her both had matching magic bracelets. The blue ice bracelets had intricate snowflake designs, but Emma could only stare at them puzzled.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Lunaria’s face went red, and she held the bracelet up above her head, staring at it in the sunlight. “I didn’t expect that you would engage us right away. I’ve never been proposed to before.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “What are you talking about?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The dragon touched their matching bracelets together. “This is a sign of love, and it means we are to be wed.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Sora looked up at the vampire with an expression of surprise that slowly turned into suspicion. “I never thought that Lady Emma would do something like this. I’ve heard of these kinds of relationships before, but to see it in reality…”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma shook her head, rapidly waving her arms and flailing like a little kitten. “I didn’t mean for this to happen! I was trying to make a slave contract.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Sora’s head swayed side to side. “I heard the words you said. You said, ‘you’re mine now.’ That’s basically an admission.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The vampire found no saviors. Even the sword agreed with their reasoning.
   <em>
    “It’s horrible. Now the only thing you can do is to take responsibility properly for your actions.”
   </em>
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   <em>
   </em>
   Emma’s unexpected savior came from the dragon in question. “Don’t worry about it. There’s actually no need for us to be wed, but this is a marriage binding contract. Normally such things are hard to break, but I’ll break off the contract if you simply let me travel with you.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “You will?” The vampire asked.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The dragon nodded. “We can always pretend to be married in the meantime. It would explain these bracelets, and it provides a link for one of us to know where the other one is. We will be bound, and that will make it easy to protect you.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “What makes you think that I need protection in the first place?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “You’ve got the Dawn after you now. You’re not strong enough to face them on your own. At your current strength, you’d be prey for them. That’s where I come in.” The dragon girl patted her large chest. “I will provide the safety and comfort, and you will provide me with entertainment.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma could only smile wryly at the proposal, but she didn’t disagree. “I feel like this is some kind of trap, but you don’t seem like a bad dragon.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Lunaria pointed towards the woodland. “Now, we should continue your journey. There are several settlements in that direction. I flew over them on the way here.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “Won’t they be panicking from the sight of a dragon?”

   “I don’t look like a dragon anymore, do I? They might simply consider me a horny individual.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma looked towards the girl’s black horns and sighed. “You should not say that. You’re an individual with horns, not a horny individual.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The dragon grinned. “Is there a difference?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “There’s a big difference. Let’s just start moving already!” The vampire looked in desperation towards Arrow. “I think we might be able to all three fit on her.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The horse turned her head away and huffed through her nose.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “I guess that’s a no. I’m not sure if I’m going crazy or the world around me is changing.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Lunaria shrugged. “We can all just walk. I didn’t see anyone following you from the sky. Unless you’d prefer to ride on my shoulders? Have you ever ridden a dragon before?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma’s face turned bright red, and she started walking to the woodlands on her own.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Sora ran beside her and grabbed onto her hand. “There is no shame in riding on someone else’s shoulders. You’ve been carrying me around a lot lately.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma looked down at the innocent little girl and patted her head. “That’s not really the issue. Also, why aren’t you sitting on Arrow?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “I figured if you two are walking, I can walk too. I’m a big girl, and I can do big things. Like learning magic!”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Lunaria caught up to us and grabbed onto Sora’s other hand. “You want to learn magic?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “Yes, but Emma can only teach me at night time. That’s a rule that I made. Otherwise, she’d be getting herself hurt like usual.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “Like usual?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The little girl looked between the vampire and the dragon.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma shrugged. “You can tell her. She’s going to be traveling with us anyway.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   There was no real explanation why the two girls trusted the dragon already. For Emma, she was someone stronger than her. She could have easily killed them in their first meeting, and the fact she didn’t warranted some trust.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   As Sora began explaining the things that happened until now, Emma observed the dragon’s expressions. Lunaria was completely dense in the ways of mortals. She had no idea how to act or where to place her hands. Her body language suffered as a result. She didn’t know what expression to make when Sora told her things, but the little girl didn’t mind. She continued on, pestering the dragon just as she did to Emma previously.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Though the dragon didn’t appear to know what to do, it was clear she was listening intently. She nodded several times, and her pointed ears twitched.
  </p>
  <p align="left">

    “

   <em>
    You staring at your wife? Thinking about when you can suck her blood next?”
   </em>
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   <em>
   </em>
   Emma turned away from the dragon and stared at her sheathed sword.
   <em>
    I didn’t even think you’d still be able to talk like this. You’re a persistent brat, aren’t you?
   </em>
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   <em>
   </em>
   The vampire was happy that she could finally see a semblance of civilization in the distance. Despite knowing that people would despise her, it was better than listening to a bratty talking sword, and it would help her deal with her heart. It pounded hard every time she stared at the neck of the dragon.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   As if Lunaria could hear her thoughts, the dragon tilted her head, and lowered her robe down slightly. “You should drink right now.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma blinked. “What? Why?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “We’re coming to a town. You’re going to need all of the strength.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “I thought you said you’d protect me?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “What happens if I’m not around? If you got lost, you might have to protect yourself. Besides, this is normal behavior among couples.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “This is? Wait, I thought that was supposed to be a joke?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The dragon giggled and threw herself at the vampire, wrapping Emma up in a hug. “You’re such a cute little thing. It makes me want to hoard you all to myself.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   <em>
    Am I a hoardling now? But I thought I cast the magic?
   </em>
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The vampire no longer resisted the temptation. With the dragon so close to her, the smell of her life essence became overpowering. Emma's fangs bit into the neck offered to her, and she returned the hug with vigor.
