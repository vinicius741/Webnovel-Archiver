<p class="cnNmOWMzMWRmZDAwMDRmMWZhN2ZkMzNkYWRmYmQ0ZWUy">Lightning cracked through the sky as rain poured down steadily, providing the perfect backdrop for my nightly activity. One that any aspiring supervillain would treat with utmost seriousness.</p>
<p class="cnNmN2Q2NmI1OGRhNDQ2YzQ4ZmIxN2E4MzY1OGZmMjM3"> </p>
<p class="cnMzMmFmYzllN2JkYjRjZmNiZDdkMWU0ZjJmZTljZTc1">Plotting how to beat their nemesis.</p>

<p class="cnNhNTI0NTg2MmYxOTQ5YmJiNmIxOTA1ZGUwZTFhNjJk">Superman had revealed himself to not be the paragon of truth and justice he pretended to be during our fight.</p>

<p class="cnNhZjU3YmYzMzc1NjQxMDViMmM4OTk0NDlmYTg5OTAx">No, instead he was some kind of spank-happy sadist hiding behind the mask of a hero.</p>
<p class="cnM0NzgwMjQwNzJjYjRhZDBiZGQxNjgwZGFiN2E0NzA3"> </p>
<p class="cnM2M2U4ZDFjNjczMTQwOTM5YmU2YzE0ZDNhODY3ZDJh">Clearly I had landed in one of those bizzaro universes where Superman was secretly evil and it was up to me to take him down! I blinked as I realized I had gotten a bit excited and then sat back down to continue cooking dinner in my newfound supervillain lair.</p>
<p class="cnM0YzUzNWZjMGY1YjQwOWNiNTg5MzgwMzM4NmVhMzA5"> </p>
<p class="cnNhNDE3YzJmMTBmYTRkMDI5MzA4YzVmOGM5YmQ5NWE3">Okay, it was a random cave I had found and moved into but it was a start. Thankfully my Attack Ball had included a remote that allowed it to autopilot to my location so I wasn’t forced to sleep on the floor even if it meant everything else was just rocks repurposed into furniture and my stove was a campfire.</p>
<p class="cnNiYjc4NmM0OGI5ODRmNWE4NDhlNTEyNjA1M2JlNmIx"> </p>
<p class="cnMxNGNmMjJkY2Q5NzRiMzA4MGZjOThiOTRmZGMyZDE3">It was still fun though. Camping is waaaay better when you are tough enough to ignore small sticks and stones poking you constantly.</p>

<p class="cnM1OGU5MjgyMmU0MjRjMjI5N2QxZDk0Y2QxYzQyNzky">I shook my head. Enough getting distracted. I needed to think of a way to beat up the big blue bully. The problem was, Superman was just too fast for me right now. I had gotten lucky with my <s>cheap shot</s> sneak attack, but otherwise nothing I had tried got close. I hadn’t managed to figure out Ki sense on my own yet either.</p>

<p class="cnM2YmQxZmM1NmVmNTQ0MGY5YzkzMWFiOTg5OGMxZTc3">After Metropolis I had kinda hoped that all the new cities I checked out would be cool and interesting. Gotham was probably going to be filthy but it at least had a cool aesthetic. But from what I saw of Central City so far was that it was…normal.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZmIwOTc0MmQ2ZjQxNGJhYTJjMjRkZGVmZGYyYzc0"> </p>
<p class="cnNhNzk0ZmM5YTQ4ZDRkZjhhMzczNDVkMmQ0NTE0Yzdi">At least the Flash museum would be pretty neat. Was that built yet? Probably not, everyone seemed pretty new.</p>

<p class="cnMyNWVjZDMxYjAxZTRjYmNhNzI1NGEyNjExYzRlNWZk">I kinda just wandered down the streets hoping to catch a glimpse of the Flash, but I wasn’t getting much luck. So I tried multitasking by practicing sensing other people’s ki.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZmNkMTgwMjE5ZDQwNmI4YmQ3OTEyZTM0YmMzMTc5"> </p>
<p class="cnMxM2M0Nzg2ODNlZTRjODM5MWE2NjVjMzE2MjZkZmUy">I wasn’t having much luck with that either.</p>

<p class="cnNiZTRjYTVjMGI1MzQzNzU4NDYxMjk2OGY2ZGNiODY3">Good news is I found the Flash. Too bad he was fighting that ice villain of his. Shoot, what was his name? Commander Chill? Private Popsical? Something like that.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZGVlOGQ4NGRmZTQ2M2I5NWE3NTY1NDJmMjY2ZjMx"> </p>
<p class="cnM5MzYyNjJkOWM1ZjRhYjFhZjE5YWQxOWY3OTk0OGRm">Anyway, the villain had just robbed a jewelry store and had frozen then shattered a wall during his escape. Now he was taunting the Flash while blasting the ground around him with some kind of frost gun, causing Flash to slide right past him when he tried getting close.</p>
<p class="cnM4OTU3OGE3MWMyMTRlZGE5NjE4OTYyNTI3NGUzNGU5"> </p>
<p class="cnM1MzJkYTE4N2EzNDQ3NTU5MWZlMjMzODNjZjE1MzY1">It was neat to see a real superhero fight but I wanted to start training soon, so when Flash slammed into a nearby parked car I floated over until I was in front of him.</p>

<p class="cnNlMzViNzM5MDE3ZDQ4N2U4N2Y2MGE5YjA0NGU4ZWMz">The speedster seemed surprised and kept looking between me and checking up on the villain. “Ah, sure mysterious floating monkey kid. But I’m a little busy right now and it’s dangerous, so why don’t we talk once I take care of Captain Cold there?”</p>
<p class="cnNhMjJjMTM5YTc1YjQ2NWRiNmZjZWE3ZjM2MzY4NjAy"> </p>

<p class="cnM5ZDlmNjBkZWFjYjRjZTY4YTdlODFkYjM1MWI2ODAz">“Hiding behind kids now, Flash? Not very ‘heroic’ of you.” the ice villain taunted while twirling his cold gun.</p>

<p class="cnNjNjhhN2Y0ODU2NjQwNTQ5MzFlZjA2YzE3MWFhYjRk">“I’m not hid-!”</p>

<p class="cnNjZjM0NWM2OTBhYTRkY2Q4Y2ExZTA0ZjU4OGE1YzE2">“...” I think I might have made Captain Cold a bit angry. “You know what? I don’t want to deal with some random superpowered kid so why don’t you <em>cool off</em> in timeout for now.”</p>

<p class="cnM3ZDdjYjE0NjRkZDRiNTA4YzMyNWFhMDcyOGEyZmEy">The next thing I knew, I was suddenly covered in some kinda weird ice.</p>

<p class="cnNhMmI3MjU0YzU0YjRiZDY4YWRhYjBjNzMwYjdkMTA5">Weird because, yeah it was cold, but I could breathe through it? I don’t think you can breathe through normal ice.</p>

<p class="cnMxZTI3YWJjNzlhZTQzYzNiOGFhYzY4YTc1ZTE5N2Rj">Still, Captain Cold had trapped me in about an inch of ice so that meant he attacked me. And that meant <strong>he was fair game.</strong></p>

<p class="cnMwY2JmZjdhZjYzZDQyM2NiZjcyYzIyYTlmNTZkYWVi">I focused my Ki and exploded it outward, shattering the ice and freeing me to both Flash and Captain Cold’s surprise.</p>

<p class="cnMxZTIyNjFiNjNiODRhYWM4OGE1Y2Y5YWI4ODMzMzll">I pitched a sphere of Ki into the ice villain’s chest hard enough to knock him off his feet and into a parked car. If the Ki orb didn’t knock him out of the fight, the cracked ribs from denting the vehicle’s doors probably would. He would be fine though. It was only a few bones at most.</p>
