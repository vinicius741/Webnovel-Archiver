<p class="cnMzMDRlMjNkZTdmMjQzNDM5Njc1NGEzNTU3MGEzYzBh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">South Maintenance Sector, Pasar Kuno District, Nusantara, Borneo, New Indo-Pacific Union territory</span></p>
<p class="cnNlM2JmMTZiZWE0ZDQ1ZWY5YzgwNjZjY2YzOGFiNDYy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><span style="font-size: 1.5em"><strong>J</strong></span>abari's heart raced as he watched the Bloodtroopers escort Ume through the crowded evening marketplace. Marisol led the group with Cheng Wei at Ume's left, pushing through the local merchants and shoppers. Jabari could see Ume moving stiffly between her captors.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDE0YTU1MTIzNzRjYTA4MjhmOGQ0MjVhNmY2MDI2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"They're taking her to the Imperial dropship." On Jabari's left, Fuuka crouched beside him on the rooftop. Her hands still glowed faintly from her healing spell. "Two kilometers northeast, just outside the Widodo Quarter."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZDYzZDQ0OTliZjQ1Yzk4YTdhODZiMTc2YTkzMzVm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">On Jabari's right, Wilhelm joined them at the roof's edge. He had a scab from a cut above his eyebrow, but remained focused despite their situation. "Six Bloodtroopers, plus Marisol and the walking tank they call Cheng. Wouldn't fancy our odds in a direct fight."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OTBhNWM0YTkxMzQ1MTA5Y2ExMzU5MmQ0OTNhNTE2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"We need to stop them." Jabari kept watching Ume. Even from this distance, he could see her stumble, one hand going to her temple. A Bloodtrooper yanked her upright, and Jabari clenched his fists. "Now."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMGFmYTMxNjZkNzRjMDZhNTY5NTYwYWZhMjIwYTAz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Your knife against Thermal Battleaxes?" Wilhelm pointed at their condition. "My handgun's nearly drained, and they outnumber us."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZmI2ODVjZmExMzRiYmJhYjNlYzA0ODVlYTE2MmJm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I can still fight," Jabari insisted. "I won't let them take her."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNWU0NDUxZWZkMjRhM2Y4YmE0NjEzMWFlZWZjMzA3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Fuuka placed a hand on his arm, her touch warm. "Your spirit honors you, but rushing in would only get you captured — or worse." Her eyes softened. "There are other ways."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MjNhOTA3ZmJkYjRlYzc5M2ZhYWU2MTAzYzYxMThi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Wilhelm watched the Imperium group. "They're moving carefully. NIPU's Neutrality Laws keep them from causing trouble in the city." He turned to Jabari with a gleam in his eye. "You remember the maintenance bay we passed? The one with that rusted sign?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYjNmOTBmOTM3NTQ3OGFiMTlkNTgyMWU5NWY0ZmZk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The shipyard?" Jabari frowned. "No."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZjQ1ZmE4NTUxYzQ2ZTdiZDE0OWY2OThkZjUwMmFk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Weren't paying attention, eh?" Wilhelm smiled. "That was one of our diplomatic outposts in NIPU territory."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhM2NhNTc3ZjE4NDRlMjBhNTIwMjBhZDRhYTMzMTk4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Fuuka raised her eyebrows. "You have a plan."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NGRmNDJiMmZhYzQzZjBhMTAxZjI2Yjc3Mzg0NzFk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I do." Wilhelm tapped his earpiece. "Seydou, this is Wilhelm. Requesting permission to access Nusantara maintenance facility and activate KM-233."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OTEwZTYzYzA5ZjRkMmZhOTVjNjMyODYyYzVmOGVk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Say what?" Seydou's agitated voice came through their earpieces, his accent thickening. "I just had that Scarab repaired! Do you know how many tries it took me to realign the hydraulics after Azure Mount?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YzlmNGZiNDczZDQ3YzE4NDZiODVmNzUwMDA3ZDJi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Ume's been taken by the Imperium," Jabari cut in, his voice tight. "They have her, Seydou."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmODIzOTYwNjM2MDQxZjA5ZmZjYTUxNmFkMzA4NGEx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">After a pause, Seydou's tone changed completely. "What? How? When? The android with all the—" He broke off. "Lion's blood, you two! Why didn't you say so immediately?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MjY0MGYzMjk2OTQ0MzY4NjZmODkyNGY0Njc3N2E4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Because some of us enjoy being dramatic," Celine's cool voice joined in. "Lieutenant Adomako, deploying heavy weaponry within NIPU territory would cause a diplomatic incident. The Neutrality Accords are clear about armed conflict in civilian areas."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZmVkNWU5ZTA4MzRjYmU4MmUzMjFhNTMwM2FlOGFi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"So we just let them take her?" Jabari asked, frustrated.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjI0Y2I2NTRhZDQ2OGVhZGQ5Y2E4YTc1NjM0Yjhh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I didn't say that," Celine replied evenly. "We have protocols for extractions in neutral territory. Measured response, minimal visibility."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMDEzY2I4OTU5MzRiN2I5MDQ5NjRkNzJhMTBiYzY2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Madam," Jabari countered, "by the time we're through with protocols, Ume will be halfway to Taiwan."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlN2E2ZGY2OTEyOTQ2MTI4NWU4NzAwYTFlNjVjYzgz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Lieutenant has a point," Wilhelm added. "Time isn't on our side here."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMGU5MGQxNWE4ZTQ2MTNiNDZlZjExMTM3OGI1ZTli"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">After a thoughtful pause, Celine spoke again. "Seydou, contact Kimaris HQ immediately. Tell them to prepare the Isazi for emergency deployment. Authorization code: 'Obsidian Elephant'."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1N2UzNThhNmNiZjQzY2Q5ZDZmODlhZWFhN2ViNmM4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Isazi?" Jabari repeated, confused. "What's that?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MWQxM2M5NzY5YTQ2NzY5OTY1M2MyZjk2YzE1Nzk1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Wilhelm's expression changed to something between excitement and amusement. "Trust me. You'll know when you see it."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYTM3OGExMmRhZDRmNTRhNTUyNWUzNzVkYjFkZGM5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari nodded, drumming his fingers on the roof. "Wish they didn't scatter our vehicles like that."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OWUyM2IxMzAwYTRjYWE5YjgxNWVlNjhhMTgxMmQw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"All Kimaris equipment follows standard protocol—distributed maintenance facilities across neutral territories." Wilhelm winked, tapping his temple. "Insurance against exactly this sort of situation."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMmY1ZGM0M2IxMzRlNjNiZjM0NDVlNTc2Njg2MDU3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The three of them crouched lower as a Bloodtrooper looked up, scanning the rooftops. Only after the soldier turned away did Fuuka speak again.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOGNlZTRiMGI4ZjQ4OGNiOWM3MDk0YTE5MGQ1NjAx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The NIPU authorities won't permit armed conflict within city limits," she cautioned, adjusting her kimono as she watched the Imperium group disappear down a side street.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZDZlMjhlNzRkMzRlN2RhYjkzOWY2ODE0ZjU0MDY3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Ume glanced back once, her eyes scanning the rooftops desperately, trembling before Cheng Wei's hand pushed her forward roughly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZWFiM2I2MWZhZDQ0NjI4MzU5YWNlNjI3NWM5M2Zk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Then we wait until they're beyond the Widodo Quarter," Wilhelm replied, sketching a quick map in the dust. "Once they enter the Borneo Lowland Rainforests, NIPU jurisdiction becomes..." he spread his hands with a smile, "considerably more relaxed."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZGMxOGE3Mzg4OTQzYjg4YjFhZDk1OWUwYmFiODUy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari was already on his feet, checking his Combat Knife. The blade caught the moonlight as he put it back in its sheath. "What are we waiting for?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZjY1MjBkOGM2NTRlNzhhNWVmODVhZTliNjA4NDM2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Remember to stay alive," Fuuka said, rising beside him. She reached up and adjusted the collar of Jabari's combat suit. "I'll come with you. My spells may help against Imperium technology."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmY2EwZmFhNjc4MzQ4YTY5MWMzNGNmNzViM2QzMjRm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Right. Okay!" Jabari took a deep breath, feeling his cheeks warm.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYzc5NWFkNTA2ZjQ4Yzc4Mjc2NzAxMTc5ZDA1YjEx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Wilhelm sighed, brushing debris from his knees as he stood. His eyes moved between Jabari and Fuuka with amusement. "Better survive this and get back to a proper dinner, eh?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NDc1MDA0YWVkNDRiYjc5ZDQ1MDAxNWFhYzc0ZTBj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Did you like the dinner, though?" Fuuka turned to Wilhelm suddenly, grinning as she ran a hand through her short hair.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4Y2M3MTJiZjI0NzQ4YmJhZTg4NzE1ZWIwODE3MDM0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Would enjoy it more if there weren't so many knives pointing at us near the end." Wilhelm joked, mimicking a blade thrust before checking his Plasma Handgun. "Though the beef was exceptional."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYTc3MjdlN2M4NDRlNWRiYjUzMzM5NzU3Y2ExNGFh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Under different circumstances, I'd have taken you two somewhere nicer." Fuuka said as she stood up, her gaze lingering on Jabari. She straightened up, speaking playfully. "Maybe next time."</span></p><span class="cjBmNzg3ZWEwOTlhYjQyMDY4NTIwOGJjZTAzNjZjMDU0"><br/>Find this and other great novels on the author's preferred platform.

<p class="cnNjMDYwMmY4MjUyOTQwN2M4NWYxYjA1NTAxN2IzNTg0"><strong><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">22:07, February 10, 2295</span></strong></p>
<p class="cnNiNGFiMzJiOGQ4NDQwNzM5ZGU5OTFhZDZkYjIxY2Fj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Directorate Maintenance Facility, Eastern Industrial Zone, Nusantara</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZDYyNzgxNGExYzQ4MzI4MTZlZjUxZWFlNTY5NTVm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The maintenance bay was dimly lit and smelled of machine oil and damp concrete. The walls were lined with equipment — Ologun exosuits being repaired, disassembled hoverbikes, and at the far end, under a massive tarp, the unmistakable shape of a Scarab mech.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NWMzOGFhMTc3NzQ5NGY5ODhiYmY5NDU5ZDA1M2Zi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Old Seydou would have a fit if he saw how they're storing his precious toys," Wilhelm muttered, approaching the security terminal. His fingers moved across the holographic interface. "Access code: Afronauts-Seven-Niner-Tungsten."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkODhhY2JiNjdmNTQ3ODNiYjBjNzAwZGYzZjdhN2Fi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The terminal turned green, accepting the code. Throughout the bay, systems hissed to life, maintenance drones scuttling from their charging stations as lights brightened.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNDYzYTg4OWUwMTQxYTM4NmNjYjcxZGUwZmUwZDNh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You think we stand a chance? To save Ume from the Imperium?" Jabari asked, watching as robotic arms began removing the tarp from the mech.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhODE5OWVjM2ZjYjQxNTE4NmQ1ZmU1NGJlM2Y3Yzc1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"We have enough time to power up and intercept them at the boundary, if they follow protocol." Wilhelm checked a gadget on his wrist. "And with your Scarab, combat just got a lot easier."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OGYxMjBkNjVkYTQxOGVhYzAwNzJhYWIzYjM5YjY3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As the tarp fell away, Jabari caught his breath. The Scarab — his Scarab—stood before them, its emerald shell gleaming under the lights. KM-233 was painted in gold across its right shoulder, the numbers partly covered by recent repairs. Its six legs were folded up, making the mech look smaller despite being three meters tall.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZWQ1NWFiODM5MTQzM2FhMjNhNDBjNjA5ZTQ2M2I2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Fusion core at ninety-seven percent?" Wilhelm observed, walking around the machine and running his hand along one of the mech's legs. The armor plates shifted slightly under his touch. "Good for emergency deployment. Seydou's been busy."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMTg3YmIxYzdiZDQwZGFhZWY5OWRhOTQ0NzRhNTQz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The last time I used it, some Imperial engineer tried to hack it," Jabari said, approaching his machine. "Wasn't sure it would ever run again."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNGJlY2QwYjUwMjRhY2U5NzcxMzcwNWY0YzBlMGFm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Fuuka circled the bus-sized mech curiously, her fingers hovering near its surface without touching. "Remarkable craftsmanship. The Directorate's integration of traditional forms with advanced technology—it speaks to cultural wisdom."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MzExNGU0MzliMjQ2OWQ5NjZhZDgzOTgyNjhhZTJl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She paused at the mech's rear section, studying the golden patterns on the emerald plating. "These are protection symbols, aren't they? And a flower icon, too."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYjJkZDliMzMxNTQ3YjE4ZWUwNTYwMDYwZjFiNzMx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You know Maridian symbols?" Jabari nodded appreciatively. "Each Scarab bears the symbols of its pilot's lineage. Mine is a king protea."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYjIxZTQwODU3MjRmZjliMjQ4NDI2NDJiMTc5OWQ1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Well, it's something alright," Wilhelm interrupted. He tapped his earpiece, listening. "Celine reports the Imperium convoy has changed course slightly. They're heading northeast, toward the old logging routes. Smart — less NIPU oversight there."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZDRkYzc0YmNjNDRkNjk5ZDhkYjVlNTk1OTFjODIz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari approached the Scarab, placing his palm against the identification panel beneath the cockpit. The panel glowed blue, recognizing him, and the cockpit hatch opened with a hiss. As it did, the mech's legs began to unfold, hydraulics purring as the Scarab rose to its full height.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OGFjY2QxMTlhMDQ3YmRiM2M4YmQ3MTEyZTUyODc2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"How will you help us without a weapon?" Jabari asked Fuuka, suddenly concerned.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NTM4NWQ5MDM2YzRkMTBhM2UxZWM2YTRkNGU5MDE2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She smiled, reaching inside her kimono sleeve. With a graceful movement, she produced a hexagonal lantern nearly the size of her head. Its bronze frame enclosed amber glass panels that amplified the bay's dim lighting. Intricate scripts were etched into the metal, remaining dark until the lantern began to pulse with inner light.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MTNhOWY0MWUxOTQzMTlhOTZlY2RjZWYwMTNlN2Zj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"My Spirit Lantern," Fuuka explained, her fingers wrapping around the braided handle. As she spoke, the lantern lightened, floating upward to hover beside her shoulder. Its glow grew stronger, casting her face in warm golden light. "Focus on your mission, Lieutenant. I'll do my part."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZmU4OGQ3MTVmMTRkYmRiNTBmYzBhZjZkMjA4NzVh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Requested access to the hangar for my Anioma—authorization came through." Wilhelm tapped his fingers on the golden Quantum Watch on his wrist, its holographic display showing a 3D map of the facility. He handed Fuuka a military-grade earpiece like Jabari's: small, dark and flexible. "Added you to our comm channel. Didn't think Amir would approve fraternizing with the enemy, eh?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ODYwZDNmYzhjMjQyYmNhNmIzZTdmZGZiOTZiZGMy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Spirit Lantern pulsed once, an amber flare that seemed almost indignant as it hovered near Fuuka's shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYzFjYzg3NjgzMTQwOGFhZGNmYmY4ODU2ZGMyOGJj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Sand Lotus has many enemies, Major Wilhelm. The Directorate isn't on that list tonight." Fuuka accepted the earpiece.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNGJhY2RlN2MyZTRkYTM5ZDljMDhmNjNiZGQ4Mzg5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"After a dinner like that, one can imagine how long the list must be." Wilhelm joked as he withdrew his hand.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OTEzZmVjNTczYjRjYTJiODAwNGViMzMxZjc4NWUw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"For now, Master Amir believes the Moondust data is more dangerous in Imperial hands than Directorate ones." Sliding the earpiece into her left ear, Fuuka continued. "Testing. One, two, three, four." she murmured.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZWI5NzIwZDI2MDQ5MGJiYWUwODA5NWU4ODNjMmRk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Signal acquired," came Celine's reply. "Dr. Celine Kamara speaking. I'm tracking three biosignatures and — " A brief pause. "—one unusual energy pattern I assume is your... lantern, Miss Natsukawa."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NTY1YjI1NjhkOTQ0MjQ4ZWNmODg4ZTEyOGJiNTM4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Spirit Lantern," Fuuka corrected gently. "A focus for Solar psionics. I assure you it poses no threat to your systems."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YmRlNzcxMmM1YTQyOGJhNmVlZjMxZjAyZjEwMzQw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"It's already disrupting our scanner readings," Celine countered. "While we appreciate the unexpected help, understand that if you compromise this mission or endanger my people, I'll have orbital systems target you with enough plasma to turn that rainforest into glass."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTVkN2Q5NzZmZjRmYjk5MzRlYjBkZWM2YTY3YzU4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Fuuka's smile remained calm. "Such firepower would violate at least seventeen NIPU neutrality laws. But your concern for your team is admirable, madam."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNzJlZGFiNjA0MDRkNzc4ODQ2MGE0OTRhNjUwYjk0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Wilhelm coughed, hiding what might have been a laugh.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDQ4YmRjNDc0NDQzMGZhNDU3ZjI1NTNjODA5OTE2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"She's got you there, Madame Celine," he muttered.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZTRlMGM3ZDdhNDQ1OTQ5ZmI2ZGNjZGQ4MTUxNGQ5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"An accurate assessment, Miss Natsukawa, which is why I'll simply have your memory extracted instead," Celine replied smoothly. "Now, all of you, listen carefully. Imperium convoy has changed course toward the northeastern logging routes. Mapping intercept coordinates now."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMTgwNGM4MmU3MjQ1NWZhNzcyOTA1OTM1NzE1YjMw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The maintenance bay's heavy doors opened, revealing the night sky. In the distance, Nusantara's lights painted the streets in gold and blue. A faint rumble of thunder came from the rainforest—a storm brewing both literally and figuratively.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZmM3MzFkMWY2YTQxMjA5YmJhZTg4ZGM0MjIzNzhk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A 3D map appeared in Jabari's HUD, showing a clearing two kilometers beyond the city limits, with a second marker moving along a winding road through the rainforest.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YmRlN2RmMzA0YzQ2ZWJhMzA2MDk1YzgyZGQwY2Zk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Seydou has the Isazi approaching low orbit," Celine continued. "ETA seventeen minutes to extraction point. With current wind conditions and Imperial convoy speed, you have a four-minute window to execute retrieval."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNWNiZmY2ZmMxNzQyN2ZiZDIxZjhhZjQzOWJlNjQ2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"We'll get Ume, then rally there," Jabari confirmed, feeling calm as the mission became clear.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NmE5OWVkNTE3YjQ3MDA4MGVjMmQ2ODk5ZmJmYTRh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Good. But remember," Celine's voice softened slightly. "No engagement with Imperial forces until they cross the red boundary line on your map. NIPU Security is watching this sector closely tonight."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMjFkOWMzMTdhYTQ1MmQ4ODk4Mjk0NjVmMzNlMWNh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Why's that?" Jabari asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MTY0MjI2OWUxMDRlYWFiZDViZWM5OTkzMGVjMDZj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Because someone filed twelve requisition forms for fusion core maintenance on a diplomatic outpost at 22:00 hours," Celine replied dryly. "Seydou's paperwork was... conspicuous."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Mjg4YmM2ZTNkOTRkY2Y4ODIwYTk0NWJjMWUzYTUw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Wilhelm winced. "Told him to be discreet."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YWFlNjNlMWQ1ZjRhYjliMzI0NzE0MjBmNGE1MmVl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Conspicuous or not," Celine concluded, "don't make me explain to Chairman Kofi why our newest lieutenant started an international incident. Execute the mission clean or don't execute it at all."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkODcwNWE5MzA4YzQ5NTdhZWQ0MjE2NDdmMTk2MDg4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Understood," Jabari responded firmly. "We'll bring Ume home."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YjZjMGQ0ZmU3YzQ3YzBiYTc0NmRiYjdjOTRlZGY5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Wilhelm backed toward a side exit, his hand on his holstered Plasma Handgun. "Weather conditions aren't ideal, but nothing the Anioma can't handle." He checked his watch. "About ten minutes until I join you."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjM2Y5ZDlkYzU4ZTQ0YmI5ZmJkMDhlNWI1ZmUyNWYx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari climbed into the Scarab's cockpit, settling into the familiar space. His hands found the manual controls, fingers gripping the worn handles as displays flickered to life around him. Status indicators blinked green across the board—weapons online, hydraulics responsive, fusion core humming with power.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwODdhYTMyNWJkYjQ4ZDY4ZWVjMjQ5ZWIyOTA3M2Uw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Through the cockpit's viewport, he watched Fuuka approach. She placed her palm against the Scarab's armored leg, looking up at him. The Spirit Lantern hovered at her shoulder, its golden light creating a halo around her.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZTJkYzc4ZTYyNzRmYmJiZGY0MzMyZGM1OTAzY2Uy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You have concerns." she called up to him.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNzliOTM4OGE4MTQ3NGM4NzA5OWZmNjU2YmRhNjNl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I hope we're not too late to save Ume." Jabari replied. He felt tightness in his chest. Excitement? Anxiety? He wasn't sure. "Any wise words?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZWEyODdhOTgzODQ5YjViZGJjYjUwNGVjMDAzZGYz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Do not fear that which has not happened." she offered with a small smile. "Live fully in the now."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZDE0M2U0NzZlNjQxMzc5MTE4ZTExNTAxZTcyODAy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari nodded once, unable to find the right words, and sealed the cockpit. The mech hummed to life around him, straightening to its full height, sensors and targeting systems coming online.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOWJlM2QyYzNlZTRlMDM5MzYwZTZjNGQyMmNkNGRj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Through the exterior cameras, he watched Fuuka step back, her Spirit Lantern pulsing in rhythm with her breathing. Her kimono moved slightly in the breeze from the ventilation systems. She didn't look afraid as the massive war machine towered above her, just calmly expectant.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOTMxNmJkY2Q0NjQxYjM4M2YzMGVlNDBhY2I0Yzg2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"KM-233, online and operational," Jabari announced, his voice steady as training took over, moving the Scarab forward. "For the Directorate."</span></p>
