<p class="cnMyM2Y3NTcxZGE5ZjQ3MjM5MTRkYjk4MjYzZTAxMTM5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna stood, the botanical dress flowing around her. She moved with natural grace, yet something in her expression seemed guarded. "Well," she said, offering her hand, "shall we show them how Earth-Dwellers dance?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOGY0MDY4YjY0NzRmMDI4NmNlNmZkODQ4M2EyMDYx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Weavers drifted closer, their luminescent flowers casting shifting patterns across the violet ground. One of them chirped encouragingly, almost lost in the alien melody.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NzQ2MDJjZGIyZTQ0NDViNjE4MWE3NTMzZmYyY2Y4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin rose, aware of Kathrin's gaze following his movements. The Helionite soup had left him feeling more alert but also more sensitive to everything – the music, the tension, the unspoken questions still hanging between them.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOTQ5ZjVjMWFkMzQ5N2Y4MmIyMjViOTk4YzM3ZDg1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As he took Lorna's hand, Xin tried to keep his breathing steady. The botanical dress clung to her curves, making him aware of how new this closeness was between them. Just weeks ago, she had been Agent Weiss, the legendary Psi Lynx. Now her fingers were intertwined with his, and he could catch the faint scent of her hair – something wild and sweet that made his pulse quicken.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDdlNmFkNzliNjQzZGNiYTI0ZDZiNWYyNmUzMDI1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I should warn you," he murmured as they moved toward the cleared space, "I really don't know what I'm doing." He hoped she couldn't feel how his palm had grown slightly damp against hers.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOGMzYTcyMTRlYzQ2ZmFiMGU2ZDMzZmFhNzVjZmQz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna's laugh had a nervous edge. "Neither do I." But there was something in her sapphire eyes, a flash of warmth that made his chest tighten. They had faced death together at Door Valkyris, yet somehow this felt more daunting.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NWYwMmM5M2RkMjRhNTE4N2FjNDY1MmUxZjgwN2Zj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Then the music shifted, taking on a deeper, more primal rhythm, and Xin realized that nothing about this night would be familiar at all.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZDhmYmRjMWY4NTRkMDA5ODVmMDBmZGEwMGI4ZTIz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The alien melody seemed to demand movement, yet Xin found himself frozen, too aware of Lorna's proximity. Her bare midriff was just inches from him, the deep purple petals of her dress wrapping her ample chest, touching his chest. He placed his other hand tentatively on her waist, feeling the living fabric pulse beneath his fingers.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MDE5YjdlNjUyMTQxNDM4YzQ2ZGI0MzQ0N2JjNDkz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Above them, the Weavers drifted in slow circles, their luminescent flowers casting shifting shadows. One of them emitted a gentle trill, as if offering encouragement.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMmRmYmJhMzQwNDRjMTJhZjNmYjU2MTE1OGMwNmY2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"About Harald," Xin whispered, using their closeness to cover his words. "He's your father, isn't he? That's why you're so interested in finding him."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NGNmNmZkYWNmZTQ4ODg4YTc4ZDc5NDg5NDQ1YmFh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna stiffened, her steps faltering. "Xin, not here," she whispered back, her voice tight. "They're watching us."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNjc5YzhlZDQ3YTRhOGM4NDVlYzQ5M2JmYjg3ZTcz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">He took a hesitant step forward. Lorna moved in the opposite direction.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OGZmNGI0MzI5OTQ4YjY4N2Y3OTg2MjRiODNkN2Vk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Sorry," they said in unison, then stopped, their feet tangling. Xin stumbled, his heel coming down hard on Lorna's bare toes.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZmE5NGNmNmJiNTRjYmNhZTQ0NjFmNTNlNmJlZjJl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She inhaled sharply. "Ah—"</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjA3MmJlOGE0MzQzYTNiMjFhZWM0NzZiZGM5YzNi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I'm so sorry!" He tried to correct his stance, overcompensated, and nearly pulled them both off balance. The Weavers' wings hummed in what sounded like alarm.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZGY2ZmQ2ZmE1ZTQ3ZmQ5ZjVkYzA5ODU2MDAzMWYy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">From her coiled position near the table, Kathrin watched with hooded eyes. Even Vyomendri's usual composure cracked slightly, a hint of amusement.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNjQ5Nzk5ZDM3NTRhZTk4YWUxODNlZDU5MmE4YWJh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Maybe if we..." Lorna shifted her weight, trying to lead, but Xin had already started moving again. Their knees knocked together. He felt heat rising in his cheeks, aware of how clumsy they must look.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NTc1NmI2OTVkODQ2ODQ4MGNkYjY4OWRmZTY1ZGE4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You're thinking too much," Kathrin's cultured accent drifted over the music. "The rhythm isn't in your head. Vyom?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTQ3MDFlZTUwYTRmYzk5M2Q0MDc5Y2U3ZWQzNGY3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Why wouldn't you tell me about Harald?" Xin whispered, trying again to find the rhythm while continuing their private conversation. "Don't you trust me?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMxODMyZGZmZjI2NjRhYjViZmZkZGQ2ODVlODg0Njkx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"It's not about trust," Lorna murmured, her eyes scanning the room. "It's about keeping the only bargaining chip I have." Her next step went wide, and Xin had to quickly shift to avoid another collision.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NzNhMGM1NDM2YTQ3NTA4MzRiYzBkMGZhNzU3YTAz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Perhaps," Vyomendri rose gracefully, "a change in partners would help you both find your footing." He moved toward them, his violet skin almost luminous in the strange light. "If I may? I promise not to interrogate about any assassination plans the Alliance might have for Harald," he added with a smile that didn't reach his eyes.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0N2Q0NmQxN2ZmNzQ4NjM5MWEyMmQwNTNlYmQwZjMw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"We're not here to kill anyone," Lorna said with equal humor and firmness, though her eyes showed hidden pain. "Just doing our jobs."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYmZkNTFiYTk0NjQwNTQ4NjY5ZjExYWYzNjVlNGFm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin caught the nuance in her voice – the subtle strain suggesting deeper waters than her words revealed. He opened his mouth, ready to reveal Lorna's connection if it might help their mission, but the slight shake of her head stopped him.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMGYzNjM1YzhmNzQ2NjA4ODA2M2YxODk2NDgwNmI3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna hesitated, her fingers tightening briefly around Xin's, her calloused palm brushing against his. But the awkwardness of the past few minutes hung between them. "Yeah...maybe we should," she said softly, not meeting his eyes.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYzM3YmYzNDQ5YTQwOWFhMDZiZGNlNGUwZGEwNjQ4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Something in Xin's chest tightened. Of course she would prefer a more skilled partner. Someone who wouldn't step on her feet or make her look foolish. He started to step back, to release her hand —</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNWVmODA2Zjk3NzQ3NDk5ZTQ5NTM4M2VhZWE1YTdi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Be gentle, Vyom," Kathrin's voice cut through his thoughts. She slithered forward, moving with hypnotic grace. "Young Xin merely needs proper guidance." Her dark eyes found his, holding something like understanding. "Perhaps I can help him learn about the Moondust shard while we dance."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNmUxYWMyMjI2NTRkYjc5MGQ2ODkyMTRkMmNjZTgy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin felt Lorna's hand slip from his as Vyomendri smoothly inserted himself between them. The Weavers adjusted their positions, their living spotlights creating new patterns on the violet ground. One of their flowers cast Lorna in an ethereal glow as Vyomendri drew her into a more practiced stance.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MmM3YzA3YzQzNzRmYTZiNzYxYzZhMWUzOGI0M2Qw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Come," Kathrin's cool fingers found Xin's wrist, her touch unexpectedly gentle. "Let me show you how the music moves through us."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZWIwNDc5M2RiYTRhMTNhNTgwYzA0NzFlZmI2N2M4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The difference struck him immediately – where Lorna's hands had been warm and calloused from years of wielding weapons, Kathrin's touch was impossibly smooth, like liquid silk against his skin.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYjkwMWExMzAxMjQyNTZiZmRhMDhhNzhmN2MwMTc0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">He should have felt relieved – being freed from his awkwardness, being offered proper instruction. Instead, watching Lorna step into Vyomendri's practiced lead, all he felt was a sense of loss. He'd had his chance, and he'd fumbled it.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NTBiMDVmNTBkZTQzZDhhNjAwYTIxNTczOWMxM2Yz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">But then Kathrin's tentacles curled around his waist, her presence both alien and oddly comforting, and the music took on a different quality. Slower. Deeper. More forgiving.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYzQwNzdlOTM2MTRmMDA4MWIxNWMyNjYxMWNlMGZi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Don't watch them," she murmured, guiding his first step. "Watch me."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyN2QyNzA5ZjRiYjQxNThhMDgxZGFhN2ViYzkxODIw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Her fingers interlaced with his, cool and perfect, somehow both alien and intimate.</span></p><span class="cjVhZjIwOGI2YmRlMjQ0NTE4MWFlODFjMzUxMjMxNzM4"><br/>This tale has been unlawfully lifted without the author's consent. Report any appearances on Amazon.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM4YjhlYzU4NWQ1ZjQ3ZThhMzcwYzFiNTk2YTM1MDIw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Slow," she murmured, her accent wrapping around the word like honey. "Let the movement build naturally." Her tentacles guided his hips with subtle but insistent pressure.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YWVkMDkwMDQ2MTQ0ZThhYTI3Y2M5ODIyYTc5ODJk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The music thrummed through him, and this time, his body responded without his mind's interference. One step, then another. No stumbling, no collision. Kathrin's form moved with his as if they shared the same pulse, her serpentine lower body creating patterns in the violet grass.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MzczY2EzMzFlNTQyNmY4MDE2ODAzODY2MWI3OTI0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Crystal shard," Xin ventured, finding confidence in the fluid movement. "Harald left it with you for safekeeping. What did he tell you about its purpose?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZTg4NzQ5YjkzODQ3NTA5YzU0YmVmNmRmMjNmODgz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Kathrin's tentacle brushed against his neck, sending an involuntary shiver down his spine. "He said it was a key – one of five scattered throughout the Sol System. Each shard unlocks a different aspect of the Crystal's power."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYzJhNmNiZGQ5MTQxNWJhOGQxMzBiMGZmMGNiMWY4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A soft chirp drew his attention upward. The Weavers had split their attention between the pairs, their luminescent flowers creating separate pools of light. Through their glow, Xin caught glimpses of Lorna moving with Vyomendri, her movements more confident now, more fluid.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MmViNzgyMjZlNDQ5MzdiNzY5NDU4YjI2YzZmYzUw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"She's watching you too, you know," Kathrin's words brushed against his ear. "Though she's trying very hard not to show it."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NWQ3ODM3OTYwMDQwYTU5MTQwOWY0OWUyNzAyYTQy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">His step faltered slightly. "I don't—"</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Nzg4MzdkZjZlYTQ5Y2RhN2Y3MGVhOTc4YmFkMmU2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Hush," Kathrin's tentacle pressed gently against his lips. "You're doing so well. Don't let thoughts spoil it."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyM2Q5Y2Q3NTE3MDRiMmJhMWRlYjg3MDJkMjk2YjFk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">From across the space, Lorna's laugh drifted over – light, musical, in response to something Vyomendri had said. Xin felt it like a physical thing, that sound. But Kathrin's touch remained steady, anchoring him to the present moment.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxY2I1YzIzN2ZhYjRiMzRiZmU2MjVkMmM2Nzg0MDE5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Your heart betrays you," she said softly, her forked tongue flickering near his throat. "It races when you hear her voice. Yet you moved so stiffly with her, bound by your own expectations." Her dark eyes held his. "With me, you dance freely. Why do you think that is?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMTRjMzAxYmYxNzQ1NTA4N2IwMGRjMTljYzZlZjAw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Different circumstances," Xin answered, focusing on the mission despite Kathrin's hypnotic proximity. "What aspect does your shard control? And why has Harald scattered them instead of keeping the Crystal whole?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNzhlYjRjZThhZjQ4NTdhODcwODYyZDEwOTJjYWZl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Before Kathrin could respond, the music shifted again – deeper, more primal. Vyomendri spun Lorna in a complex turn that made her botanical dress flare like wings. As she moved, her eyes met Xin's across the space, holding something unreadable in their blue depths.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkODZkMTgyNzM0MjQxMDQ4YjYxMGVkYjc4OTMzYjE4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Our shard is just one of many," Kathrin finally answered. "It allows the bearer to see truths hidden from ordinary perception. As for why Harald scattered them..." Her tentacles tightened slightly around his waist. "Perhaps he feared what the whole might do in the wrong hands. Or perhaps he simply enjoyed the game of it all."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOWU3OTM1MmMxZjRhYTZhNzM1YWVjMGRhOTQyOTUz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Then Emmanuel's voice cut through the moment, bright with laughter. "Come on, Tanha – show them how it's really done!"</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYjBlMWJiZDM2MDQzMTdhZTA3MDI2MTVjZjJjOTA2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Tanha rose with predatory grace, her violet skin almost glowing as she pulled Emmanuel toward a different section of the clearing. The Weavers adjusted again, their lights creating a triangle of illuminated spaces for the three pairs.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MzBhODRiZDQ3NjRmNzg4OTBhYWY5OTdiMGVkOGU4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You see?" Kathrin's voice drew Xin's attention back. "How easily they embrace the moment." Her tentacles guided him through a turn of his own, perfectly timed to the alien rhythm. "Perhaps there's wisdom in their surrender."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NzIyNTIwMGEyNTRlZDdhYzM5NjNiYjUyYzhjZGI4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The word 'surrender' hung in the air between them. Xin felt the heat of the Helionite soup still coursing through him, making everything sharper, more immediate. Kathrin's proximity, the hypnotic sway of the music, the way her perfect hands seemed to know exactly how to move him – it was all becoming dangerously comfortable.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMjRiY2UyNWY0MTQ0MjU5M2Q3NTQ1ODdmMTQ5ZmRk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Not surrender," he said, forcing his mind to clarity. "Focus. The Alliance needs that shard to counter the Imperium's power. They've already begun using the Crystal to control Radi-Mons."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNDQ1YjY2YjNkYjQzYjM5OTIxMjNiYzE0ZjczNmNi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"And what would your Alliance do differently?" Kathrin asked, her movements never faltering. "Control them for their purposes instead?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDY0MTI5MWRhNDQyODliNGYzNTdhNzZiYzExY2Yy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">He caught one more glimpse of Lorna, her golden hair catching the Weavers' light like a halo. For just a moment, her dance with Vyom brought her closer, and he heard a fragment of their conversation.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MTk0MzdiMGFlNTQyMWZhZjRlZGI4Y2UxZmMzZThj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"—not just any interest," Vyomendri was saying. "The way you speak of him, one might think you were his—"</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NGEyZDI1YTRmYjQ3ZjViODViOGM3NzgzNjQzZWVm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Just tell me if he's alive," Lorna interrupted, her voice carrying a raw edge that Xin had rarely heard.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMTQxODM0ZmEwMzRiYThiNmEwYmU1NDQyYjE5YWQ0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">But then Kathrin's tentacles tightened slightly around his waist, and the dance carried them in opposite directions.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMmMwN2FhZDJhMjQ4YmZhYzczNTU2MDJkMjcxODY4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The music swelled, taking on an almost hypnotic quality. Through the Weavers' shifting lights, Xin watched as Emmanuel and Tanha moved further from the main group, their laughter fading into the violet shadows of the forest. They seemed lost in their own world, unconcerned with the tensions around them.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOGIzYTc5NTZhNTQ2NDNiYjJhNWQ4M2JjMjk3ODJi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You're still fighting it," Kathrin observed, her cool fingers tracing patterns on his palm. "The rhythm, the moment – everything the night offers." Her tentacles swayed with the music, creating their own counter-melody against his skin.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4N2QyNTI0MTY2NDRhYjc4OWFlM2JlZDM3OTY5ZmFk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Across the space, Lorna executed another turn with Vyomendri. Her movements were perfect now, refined, yet something about them seemed almost mechanical. As if she too were thinking too much, watching too carefully.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMjU3MzAwMThlNzRkM2U5NzJlMjM4MjY2NGE4YjU1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Not fighting anything," Xin said, but even he could hear the lie in his voice. "Just focused on our mission. The Crystal shard is too important to get distracted."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMmNmYzA0ZTc2MTRjNGNhNjQ4M2MzMTllMmE4MzY0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"No?" Kathrin's dark eyes seemed to peer into his soul. "Then why does your pulse quicken every time she looks this way? Why do your steps falter when you catch her watching?" Her forked tongue flickered out, tasting the air between them. "Why do you tremble when I do... this?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNjI0NTZkNmUyZTRjMzViMTNlNjA4ZGYyNmJjODg2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Her tentacle brushed the nape of his neck, sending an electric shiver down his spine. The touch was intimate, dangerous – and somehow exactly what his body had been waiting for.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NDU2ZjBlY2RlOTRhMGVhMGE4MTk0NWQ5YWE3YzU2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Weavers drifted lower, their luminescent flowers casting pools of light that pulsed with the music's rhythm. One of them chirped softly as it passed, its sound carrying a note that might have been warning or encouragement.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMzZiMzMxMzgxNTRlMTNhM2E0NjNhNTY5NTVjMTZj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"If you want the shard," Kathrin whispered, "you'll need to convince Primarch Moro that your intentions are pure. The Crystal doesn't merely respond to possession – it responds to worthiness."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNWNmMGY2MjdiMzQxYTQ4ZTAyYmJjZWIwYzM3OWQy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Our intentions are to prevent war," Xin said firmly, though his body continued to respond to Kathrin's expert guidance. "To keep the Moondust Crystal from becoming a weapon."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYzg3M2Q0NjQyZTQ0Mjk5YWMxMzgyODZiNGU5NjI0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Don't think," she whispered. "Feel." Her smooth hand found the small of his back, guiding him into a movement that felt more natural than anything he'd managed all night. "Let the Helionite show you the way."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYTFkMzFhNTcyODRmNDQ5NTFiOTM2YjczYjBhMDNi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The soup's warmth still coursed through him, making everything sharper, more immediate. He was acutely aware of Kathrin's alabaster skin gleaming in the light, of how perfectly their bodies moved together, of how easy it would be to just... let go.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNDI3MDQ4NWU5ZTRmYmVhNGMwYTcxYzQ1ZjY5N2Yy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Through the dance's haze, he caught one final glimpse of Lorna. She had stopped moving, standing almost still in Vyomendri's loose embrace. Her sapphire eyes met his across the space, and in them he saw something that might have been hurt, might have been resignation – or might have been permission.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YzYyNzVlZWZiZjQwMGI5OGFiYTg5MmE3Njc3OThh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The music began to fade, its alien tones giving way to a deeper, more primal rhythm. The Weavers' lights dimmed, creating shadows that seemed to pulse with possibilities.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMTMyNjQ0MWJhYzRiYmRhNTdmNDk0ZmI5Y2U3ZmZl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Come," Kathrin's voice was silk and secrets. "There's something I want to show you." Her tentacles coiled with gentle insistence, drawing him toward the edge of the clearing. "A place where the night holds different kinds of secrets."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NWM5NDkxNTJmMDQ4ZDdhODUyZjUwYjZjYzI2NjU3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin found himself nodding, letting her lead him away from the pavilion, away from the fading music, away from Lorna's unreadable gaze. The Helionite's warmth had settled into his bones, making everything feel inevitable, destined.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OThlOGZlMGJmYzQ2MTA5ZmU1ZDQ1ODI5ODNhNDJm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Behind them, the Weavers' chirps grew fainter, their lights dimming until only the violet shadows remained. Somewhere in the distance, Emmanuel's laughter mingled with Tanha's, carried on the alien breeze.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYzZiMjM1OWQzYjRlYTJhN2IwYWVmOWRkZWQwZDMw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">And in the last moment before the forest swallowed them completely, Xin's sharp hearing picked up Lorna's voice.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMGJiOTI1OGVjNzQ5NTVhNzY1NGI5YTUwYjg4Mzkz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Hey, Vyom," the voice came, so soft it might have been imagination. "I need some time. Alone. To think about what you said about Harald."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxODViZTBiMzgxZjRhZWVhNmFhZWU2MmEwNGEzMTMz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"So soon?" Vyomendri's voice replied, equally gentle. "We've only begun to unravel these truths between us. You know where to find me when you're ready to continue our... conversation."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOGU0NWJhZDRjMTQxMzM4Yjg4MzJlM2Y3NWM2N2Jk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">He could hear the emotion in Lorna's voice as she responded. "Yeah. I just need to process...everything."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDFlNGFhYzQ2MzQzYzA5MzE1NTQ1OTUyOTdjYWEw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">But then Kathrin's cool fingers found his chin, turning his face toward hers.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDE5YTVjNGY2ZTQyMjZiOWY1MmRmNmExN2I3ZGQ0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As they walked together, the night opened up before them, the gas giant Chandrak blooming ominously in the night sky above. "We may discuss the Moondust shard," she murmured. "But let me show you some other wonders first."</span></p>
