<p class="cnM5MjA5ZDg1ODBmNTQ3NzI4YjliYjA4MWU4M2VjMTk0" style="margin-bottom: 0">I took a breath in and held it for a moment, before nodding. “Very well. I finished up my personal projects in the Chu’unthor’s machine shop and began to leave the ship. I detected several hostile presences outside the ship entering it and beginning to search for me. With two outside waiting for someone to try to flee, I didn’t want to put myself between their forces. So, I engaged in stealth tactics, isolating and eliminating the enemies within the ship to avoid alerting the rest and having to fight multiple opponents in an enclosed space. Once the enemies inside were eliminated, I took out the guard on the door, then went after the last threat both to gather more information and ensure that I didn’t leave anyone behind who could perhaps track me back to our allies, then return with allies and start a larger conflict when we weren’t prepared for it. I questioned her and she confirmed that her forces were there to kill whoever had been in the ship. She offered to recruit me into their tribe and I politely declined. Negotiations broke down after that and a fight ensued. I won.”</p>

You forget that this is a <em>child</em><span style="font-style: normal">. Not even a Padawan yet. We don’t teach those sorts of tactics to just anyone, and certainly not to our younglings. Is this something she learned on Dathomir, or is it a sign of something more? We need to know.”</span></p>

Due to this, flora and fauna both have adapted against predation, either by means of poison, camouflage, natural weapons or defenses like spines, and the like.
