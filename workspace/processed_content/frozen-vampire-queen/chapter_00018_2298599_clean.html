   Lunaria laughed into her hand and smiled. “You’re an Emma? I don’t think I’ve ever met one of your kind before. Vampire was it?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma shook her head. “No, Emma is the name, and vampire is what I am.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “I see, I see.” The dragon girl placed a hand on her chin, looking the vampire over. “I’m surprised the frost didn’t spread this far south. It looks like sometimes prophecies are merely words to scare the children.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma’s face wrinkled in confusion. She stared at her sword.
   <em>
    Do you know what she’s talking about?
   </em>
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   <em>
    “Unfortunately, I haven’t the faintest clue, and I don’t really care either.”
   </em>
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   <em>
    Hey! What about our deal? I thought you are supposed to be nicer to me now.
   </em>
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   <em>
    “The deal hardly counts anymore when a dragon is the one that took your kills.”
   </em>
   The sword glowed in smug satisfaction.
   <em>
    “Or do you mean to lie and say that you killed all of the gnolls?”
   </em>
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   <em>
   </em>
   Emma grit her fangs together, resisting the urge to throw the sword. At the very least she needed to keep her composure. The vampire looked up to see the dragon had moved closer to her face. Emma was so close now that she could feel the warm breath coming from the girl’s nose.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The vampire flinched and backed up, clutching her sword tight. “What are you doing?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Lunaria shrugged. “I was just listening in on your conversation. Though, maybe that was not the correct response. Is it considered rude?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma gasped in shock, but a savior arrived in the form of a little girl on horseback.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “There’s a dragon!” Sora shouted.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma gestured with her hand towards Lunaria. “Sora, meet dragon.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The little girl’s eyes widened in disbelief. She jumped off the horse, Emma forced to catch her in mid air.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “What the heck are you doing?” Emma asked. “I thought I told you to run?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “More importantly, there’s a dragon!” The little girl complained, grabbing onto Emma’s hand.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “I’m trying to tell you that this is the dragon.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The dragon in question giggled and lowered herself down to Sora’s height. “You’re an interesting little girl.” The dragon reached her hand out to the stunned Sora’s face.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Yet before she could touch the girl, Emma grabbed her hand. “Okay, that’s close enough. Just because you’re beautiful doesn’t mean you can just do whatever you want.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The dragon girl’s face heated up, and she retracted. “I’m sorry. I’m not familiar with how these things go. It’s been...a long time since I talked to any mortal.”

   Sora tugged on Emma’s dress and shook her head. “I don’t think she’s a bad dragon.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “What do you mean she’s not a bad dragon? Do good dragons exist here too?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Karlack zapped the vampire.
   <em>
    “And what about good vampires? Do those exist? I bet you’re only thinking about how that poor dragon tastes.”
   </em>
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   <em>
   </em>
   Emma felt her heart thumping when she considered what the sword said. She could picture it in her mind. The more she attempted to deny the thoughts, the more prevalent they became. The vampire shook her head and sheathed Karlack.
   <em>
    It’s about time for you to go to sleep.
   </em>
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   <em>
    “
   </em>
   Wait a second,” Emma said, looking towards the dragon. “Can you hear everything Karlack says?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Lunaria nodded. “Are you planning to eat me?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “No, I’m not going to eat you! Unless...Wait, no I definitely won’t eat you!”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The dragon slithered closer to Emma’s face. They were so close that Emma could almost taste her if she leaned forward.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “Unless?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Luckily for Emma, she was saved once again by her hero. It was sad for the mighty vampire to be saved numerous times by the little girl. Sora pushed her way in between the two.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “What is a dragon doing here anyway? Even if you’re a dragon, I won’t let you hurt Lady Emma.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Lunaria placed a finger on her chin and tilted her head. “What am I doing here? Well, initially there was a reason, but you can say I’m bored. So, I’ve decided. I will join the two of you henceforth.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “Actually, there are four of us,” Sora corrected. “Don’t you ever forget about Karlack and Arrow.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma looked at the little girl in disbelief. “Didn’t anyone ever tell you not to trust strangers? I’m pretty sure I also told you that.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Sora shook her head. “She’s not a stranger. She’s a dragon. Besides, we can really use the extra strength right now. I already know you’re not very strong in the day. In that case, why not make Lunaria your servant like you did with Arrow?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “I can’t just make her my servant! She’s not a horse, she’s a person...a dragon person.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The little girl shrugged. “I heard stories about people riding drakes.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “I don’t understand you at all. Why are you so nonchalant about this? Shouldn’t you be panicking about my safety or something?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Sora nodded and patted her chest. “Naturally, you will be safer with a dragon servant.” The little girl looked towards their new dragon friend with puppy dog eyes. “Won’t you become a servant to Emma?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Lunaria grinned from the little girl’s antics. “Sure, I’ve never been a servant before, and it could be interesting.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “Exactly, I knew that something like that would never…Wait what?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The dragon crossed her arms. “I’m saying that you should make me your servant. That way, I can come along with you, and you won’t be suspicious of my behavior.” She pointed at the horse. “Just use whatever magic was cast on that...Hmm, Arrow was it?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Sora nodded. “Yes, Arrow.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “Wait, wait, wait,” Emma said, “I must be going crazy or something.” The vampire grabbed onto the dragon’s shoulders and shook her. “Are you okay? Did you perhaps hit your head on the way over here?” Then she looked at the little girl. “And you, did you also hit your head when I told you to run?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “No.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “No.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma laughed at the absurdity of the situation. “Luckily, I still have a small amount of magic left, but are you sure? Will this even work?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The dragon nodded. “It won’t be the same as your horse, but it should work.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “What do you mean should? Whatever...don’t blame me for what happens.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   While Emma readied the magic, there was only one thought on her mind. She wondered if this dragon was somehow masochistic.
   <em>
    Who willingly submits to become a servant of someone weaker than them?
   </em>
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   <em>
   </em>
   Emma closed her eyes and pressed her hand against the dragon girl. Magic channeled up her body into her closed eyes. When she opened them, they were shining blue.
   <em>
    What was it that I said to Arrow before to make her a servant?
   </em>
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   <em>
   </em>
   The vampire could hardly think of the words to say while staring into the dragon’s eyes. Only three words came to mind.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “You’re mine now.”
