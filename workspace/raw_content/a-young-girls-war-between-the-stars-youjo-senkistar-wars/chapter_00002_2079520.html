Close enough to interbreed, genetically divergent enough to count as a new genus. We were just one of many, included among the likes of Sephi, Borneck, Etti, Chiss, Hapans, Tof, and more. Physically, Zeltrons had skin tones in shades of red—from light pink up through crimson. Hair colors were generally reds, but also blue, black, brown, silver, and white.</p>

<p class="cnNjYjQyMDY1Y2QxYzQ2MDI5Mjc2MWFlYWMxMjBlYmNm" style="margin-bottom: 0">Firstly, Zeltrons were all beautiful. Given that and the unnatural hair coloring, I was betting on there having been some genetic engineering at some point in our past. There was no such thing as an ugly Zeltron, unless they were physically scarred. Every woman I had seen outside of the orphanage was mouth wateringly enticing to my tastes and I imagined puberty was going to be hell for me and a test of my willpower and self-restraint like none before. Even the men were anywhere between handsome and pretty on the masculinity scale, with even the most rugged of them still looking like he had stepped off the set of a Hollywood movie on his <em>worst</em><span style="font-style: normal"> day.</span></p>

Or, on the flip side, if you were </span><em>too quiet</em><span style="font-style: normal"> people might start thinking there was something wrong with you.
