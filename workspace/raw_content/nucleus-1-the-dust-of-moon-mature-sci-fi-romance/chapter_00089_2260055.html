<p class="cnM0NDk1NGVlYWM1OTQyYWJiZTdlMDE0Y2M5Mzk3NWM2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><strong>10:55, Day 579, Year 58133</strong></span></p>
<p class="cnM1Y2EyMjdjMGQwZTRlNDg5YTk5NDcyNWNkODU5MmUw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Bodhasya Parvatah (बोधस्य पर्वतः), The Mountain of Enlightenment, Shashan</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZTA4NzQwODdlYTQ2NTk5NGM4MDk4MzY3ZjE2ZGNk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I need..." Lorna's voice trailed off as the Space Rover suddenly lurched, tilting sharply to one side. "What the fuck?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OTY0YzE2NjQ1NTQwZGViMGZlNDI5MTgzNDE1YzYy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin's hands tightened on the steering wheel as he tried to correct their course. The Rover's wheels spun uselessly, sinking deeper into something that hadn't been visible moments before.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOTFkMWJjOTliOTQwMjA4ZDg3MDBjOWVjZGQ0NTIw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"We're stuck," he announced, killing the engine before it could overheat. The sudden silence amplified the soft squelching sounds coming from beneath them.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNjg1MWM3NmRjNDRlNThiMTIyYjJkYjQ1ZjZlZDQx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna peered out the window. What had appeared to be solid purple ground was actually a thin crust covering a bog-like expanse. The crust had collapsed under the Rover's weight, and now thick, gelatinous fluid was slowly enveloping the wheels.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYmNhMjNkMzczMTRlODY5ZmMyMjg5YTU2YWM5NTY4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Great," she muttered, reaching for the door handle. "Let's just…"</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNDAwOTRjNTZhZjRjMmQ4MmZiNzBmYjBlYjE0M2E2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Assess the damage." Xin finished for her.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYWI0Yjk4YzRkNzQ0ZGM4NmJhYWNhYzFmMzQyZjBh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The moment her boots touched the bog's surface, Lorna felt the strange consistency – neither fully liquid nor solid, with a peculiar elasticity that seemed to respond to her weight. The air around them had changed too, filled with tiny luminescent particles that drifted like pollen.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZDBhMjE2M2U2MzRmNDk5MTZjZTk5ZjhiOTcyZGFj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Don't breathe too deeply," she warned, covering her nose and mouth with her sleeve. "Something's not right about this place."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMTI2MTQ0NGQwODRjNzE4YTUxNjMzYzk2YWUyOGQ4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin stepped out on his side, studying the bog with newfound interest. His pupils had dilated slightly, reflecting the bioluminescent particles floating around them.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYmNjYzNlZjJmZTRkOGViMDIyOGFhMzVjMDc4ZjZh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"It's...beautiful," he whispered, lowering his hand from his face. "Can you feel it? The energy here?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNzE2NDE4ODdkMDRiYzdiMWY3ZTBjMTk4NzdkZWYw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna circled the Rover, assessing their situation. The vehicle had sunk about thirty centimeters into the strange substance. "We're definitely stuck."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZDJkNTdmNGEyNDQzY2FhNWMxYjBlMGVjNWE4MTRk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She glanced up, noticing Xin hadn't moved. He stood transfixed, staring at his hands as tiny green sparks danced between his fingers.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Y2UxOWY4MTg4NDQxZjk4ZTYwMWYyY2Y5ZWU5NGEz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Xin?" Alarm crept into her voice.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZmU0ZmZlYjYyODQ0M2JhMTg2ZTJlYjAxNWEzMGJk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I can see it, Lorna." he whispered. "The Aether. It's everywhere. Flowing through everything. Through you, through me, through this place." He looked up, his eyes wide with wonder and fear. "So this is what it's like?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZDk2M2VkN2YxMjRmZmY5NjVmMDJhMGU2ZmU0N2Ri"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna approached him cautiously. "It's the spores in the air. They must be triggering your Aether." She touched his shoulder. "We need to focus. Get the Rover out of this bog."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMGJiMjMzYTgwMDRhZDg4MWRlYWIzNGQ4OTVlYWM1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin nodded, but his movements were dreamlike. "Yes, the Rover. Though I can feel the bog's energy. Like a heartbeat." He suddenly lurched forward, clutching his head. "A bit too much. Too much at once."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Y2FhZWJlMjA0NzQzMzBhMTZkNjFmOTk4OTI2ZmU5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Around them, the bog began to pulse with light, responding to Xin's distress. The luminescent particles swirled faster, creating intricate patterns in the air.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjQ1NWJiYjRhZTRlZjRiMTQzNTI4MDU3NmExNWM5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Xin, listen to me," Lorna said firmly, gripping both his shoulders now. "This is your first psionic experience. The spores are amplifying everything. You need to find an anchor, something to focus on."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MTJmYTFiYzBkMzQwMjNiZWQyNGI2ZGM4ZWIxYzA5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"An anchor?" he repeated, his voice strained.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZTk0MGUxN2UxNzRjNzE4OTY4ZjE4ZGMzMWUxOThm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yes. When I first discovered my abilities, I focused on my pendant." Her ivory fingers touched an absent space at her throat. "Find something tangible, something real."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlODk1YzdjYjQ1MzRhMDY4N2JiM2ZmZDBhOTRhOTlk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin's eyes found hers, his pupils so wide that his eyes appeared almost black, verdant lines of wisps dancing in them. "Okay. You." he said simply.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNWExM2RmY2Q0YzRiOGI5YTY3OWFjNjU5NDVkNjZh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"That's not…" she blushed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMThmMGMwMjNiYjQ1NGM5ODVkMjIwNGRlOTAwMjI2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You're my anchor, Sigrún Fjeld." he insisted.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMjkyNGQ1NDI1ODQ4NWVhNDY5MmU5ZTA2YTdiMjcx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Before Lorna could respond, the bog around them surged. The gelatinous substance rose up in waves, flowing away from them in concentric circles. The Rover shifted as the material beneath it changed consistency.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZDRmY2ZmMzIxODQxNDdiZTE5NjExOTZhNWIxYjM2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"What's happening?" Lorna demanded, bracing herself as the ground continued to undulate beneath them.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZDcwYzU0ZDZjMTRkM2E5ZmU4MTcxNDhhM2FkZmQx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I think this place is alive," Xin said, his voice steadier now. "It's responding to our emotions. To our Aether."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NGI2MjgzMjBjMTRiMTNiNzYzNGY0N2FjNDlhZDQ3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna watched in astonishment as the bog continued to pulse, the patterns becoming more complex, more deliberate. "It's like…" she whispered. "…a massive sensory organ?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNmNmMjA4YTMwMzQ1ODNhMGMyOWZiZTg1ZTc2MDk3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yes, or a neural network. Part of Shashan itself, maybe," Xin agreed. He closed his eyes, concentrating. "The spores are not just triggering my abilities. They're... communicating."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMjMyNTI0MDYzYjQ5ZWU5MTdiNzAzZTBlNjAzMWI4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The waves in the bog settled into a gentle rhythm, matching Xin's now-steady breathing. The Rover, previously stuck fast, now rested atop a firm platform of the strange material.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTdiNjI1MjNkMTQ1YzFhMDQzZDE3MWZiNzNjMjVh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Can you understand what it's saying?" Lorna asked, fascinated despite herself.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MzQ2ZWUxYTQzMzQ0YmE5ZTgxZWNjNmM3ZjQ3ZDBj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin's brow furrowed in concentration. "Not words exactly. More like... impressions. Emotions." His eyes flew open suddenly. "It's warning us."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YmY2NjJiYjU4MzQ5YmY4ZTYyYmY1YjZhZWUxOWNj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"About what?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNTIyYjAwZTQ4NzRjOGZiODk3OWM4YzkxYTRhZTY3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Danger. Coming from..." he pointed toward the horizon, in the direction they had been heading. "There. Where this Primarch Moro is."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTg2NDI5ZjRmMTQ2ODU4MGY0ZTExYjM0MmUwMjk4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The bog pulsed again, more urgently this time. New patterns formed in the swirling particles – shapes that looked almost like creatures, moving in formation. Hounds with bones sticking out their rotten flesh, and giant stink bugs in dark shells, long antennae on their heads.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZjU4MTQ2ZjEyMDQwZTdhZTgwOGVhYjMzYTFlNTEx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Those look like Radi-Mons…" Lorna said, squinting at the miniature light show. "Have we seen these before?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZjJkYmJmNWY2YjQ5Zjg4YmYwOWExZjUyOWU1ZGVh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Fenris Horde." Xin whispered. "Is the bog showing us a Fenris incursion?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjc3M2E4NThjNTRlNWQ5MTY2NGZmNWQxMmNhYzA4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna's hand instinctively went to her neck, searching for the comfort of her missing pendant. "If they're attacking Shashan..."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNzkxMzNjYTRlYTQyMjJiYjAwZGM5MTYyMTdmOTI4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Then the Rakshasa are about to be at war," Xin finished. "And we're caught in the middle."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MDk4ZmVmN2IwZjQ1ZWNiYTk1NjAzYTQ0YWRiMjNh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The bog surged once more, creating a clear path for the Rover – a solid bridge stretching toward Moro's mountain.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NDQ0OWI1Yzg5YzQ5OTRhYWM3YTQ4Njc2NWQ2ZDdi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"It's helping us," Lorna realized. "But why?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NGEzYzRiYzRjNzRhMmRiZDQzM2U1OGU3ZjA0OTc2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin turned to face her, the green sparks between his fingers now forming more coherent patterns – crude but recognizable. "It senses something in you."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZWUzZGM4ZmUxNjQxNzQ5MzM0ZTQxNmIyZGU2Mzcz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I honestly doubt it." Lorna murmured.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOWNkNmU5YzhkZjRkODM5MzVjMDc4YTdkOTdmMzFm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"We need to get to Moro," Xin said, the dreamlike quality leaving his voice as determination took its place. "Whatever's happening, we need to warn them."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMzdiZWZiZDJjZjQ2YjlhMDRkMjFkZDRmZDllYzcx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna nodded, her earlier anger at Xin temporarily set aside in the face of this new threat. "Can you drive?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MjNmOWQ5ZjRhZDRjMTU5N2UwZGU5NzJhMzUzNTZi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I think so," he said, flexing his fingers. The verdant energy dispersed. "The initial shock is wearing off. I can control it better now."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMzQxYTJkNzBmMzQ4ODI5YmMwZjM3ZTQ5NGFjYjNi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As they returned to the Rover, Lorna paused, looking back at the bog that had nearly trapped them. "When I first discovered my abilities, I was terrified. I thought I was going insane."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NGEwNDY3ZTg1NTRlMTZiODVlMjI0OTBjNTZjY2Jl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Did you?" Xin asked, his hand on the driver's door.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDRlNzhlNGE0ODQ2MDk4MDcwMmVlMmI3YTMyYmEx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yeah." She met his gaze. "It happened that night, after Sven and my...first time."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNzEyOWVhZGViOTQ5NmQ5Mjg5ZmVjOTBkY2FhNGE3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Uh…Sven?" He raised an eyebrow.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1N2IyMTNhMmZmZDRiMTQ4ODRiYWJjNmU2YzhlOGEy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"That's what Skarn was called when he was human." She offered.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZWRkYzcxMWRjNzQ0MTQ5NzA0ZmFiN2VmZWNjZGRh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">He nodded slowly. "You were very close."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNzA1NGQwOWUwZTRhY2E4MDZiYzkzMDVjNWZkMjBl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yeah." She said again, feeling heat rising on her face as she bit her lower lip. "Thought I'd get pregnant after we did it. Instead…the Aether in my nucleus awakened."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Yzk3MDMyMmZiZTQ3OWFhNDkzMGI4MjY1N2RhMTEz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I see." He replied.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZGM5NGFiYzA3YzQ3YjNiMzRkNzVjM2E4NDExNmI0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"We'll talk about it later," Lorna said, climbing into the passenger seat. "Right now, we have bigger problems."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOGI1ZDRkMTAwMDRjYjc4ODRhODcxMTRhNjU1Mjc2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Rover's engines roared to life, and they sped along the solid path the bog had created for them, heading toward the looming mountain and whatever awaited them there.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MmE3YzM3NGQzMjQ4MTJiZTA4M2M2MGQ0NTQ1ZDAz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Behind them, the bog settled back into its deceptively peaceful state, the luminescent particles gradually dimming – but not before forming one last pattern: a violet phantasm, a perfect replica of the pendant hanging around Lorna's neck. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2MTIxMmNjZTdjNzQzODBhNDJmMmQxZjMyOGM4NzBk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">And — as she narrowed her sapphire eyes to see — another figure took form, in the shape of a wingless dragon.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNWM2NjQzY2E2MTRjMDhhZTI2NzcwMmI0Yjc2YjY1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A Diabolisk's phantom standing behind hers?</span></p><span class="cjBiOGFjNjBjOWZlOTQ3MWNhYWZmZGY0OTFhNzVhZGM0"><br/>Taken from Royal Road, this narrative should be reported if found on Amazon.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM1NGM1NWRlMTllNzQxZWU5Y2I1NmIyOGYwOGIwNDMz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">But the phantasms faded away before she could discern anything else. The Rover lurched forward, carrying her and Xin away.</span></p>
<hr/>
<p class="cnNlYTJhNWNiMmEyZTRiOTBhZGZiNjk5NzNmMjUxZGEz"><strong><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">11:11, Day 579, Year 58133</span></strong></p>
<p class="cnMxOWIwZGRiNzRiOTRhMjA4YThhNzdmZDcyMDExODRh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Bodhasya Parvatah (बोधस्य पर्वतः), The Mountain of Enlightenment, Shashan</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZDI3MDJmZjBiOTQwOTQ4NDI1MGU1MDQ4NjY4Zjc5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><img alt="image" src="https://nucleusseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ch58-Moro-full.png"/></span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZjIzMjgxOWFlNDRiYmQ5Yzk4YjRkYWIyYjI1YWY3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Space Rover's engines quieted as it stopped at the summit. Lorna unfastened her seatbelt. The landscape looked strange — purple grass and bent trees surrounded a massive Bodhi Tree at the center.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MWQwZGVkZGJlZTQ0ZDA5NmUzMDAwNzcwMTc0YWEz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Here we are. The Summit of Bodhasya Parvatah. The location that Vyom gave us," Xin said, breaking the silence, pronouncing the Devavāṇī name easily.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MzFiZGI4ZTlhMDQzZWU5NzUxZDFlMjYyNzIyMjY0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna stepped out of the Rover into the strong mountain winds. She shivered despite her high-tech turtleneck and beige trench coat. Her blue eyes scanned the alien landscape.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNjEyNGUzZGE3NDQ4ZWE4ZGFlZjU0YzkwMjZkNGE4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Here, you might need this," Xin said, handing Lorna some flatbread she had left in the vehicle.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOWFjNGUzMTNiZjQ4YTI5MjIzOWYzOTVkZDkyYjUx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She took a bite reluctantly. At first, it didn't taste great, but soon she recognized the flavor of Hickory-Smoked Ham. With each bite, it tasted better until she finished it, feeling warmed through.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YTY0NDg5NjIxZTRlMTBiNWU5YTkwYWJjZDFlNzkw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I made that bread with Kathrin," Xin said hesitantly. "We used one of the food supply crates from the Rover. Emmanuel said you always liked the ham."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNWY0ZmJhZDc0YjQ4NWQ5N2FjMGE5ZGRhMGUxYzY1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The wind carried strange chanting sounds. The Bodhi Tree seemed to pulse with energy, its roots submerged in glowing green liquid that reflected on the purple grass.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYjhiNTRmZjRlZDQ1NWViMDUwZjZjOGI2ZDY5ZTRm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Where exactly are we supposed to meet this Primarch Moro?" Lorna asked, sounding both awed and uneasy.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTUyMjVlZWY3NzQ1M2FhMTVjZmYxYzA4N2UyNzY2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin checked his Quantum Watch. A green hologram appeared, showing their location under the giant tree. "Vyom instructed us to meet him here."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYjJkMTQzNmU2YzQ1NzVhMzU1MzRjOWYxMTk0ZjE0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna looked around for any sign of the Primarch, her fingers touching the spot where her pendant used to hang. Its absence felt like a void.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZDVhN2M1NjkwMTQ4ZDc5MDIxMGFkYWRjNmE5Mjky"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As she approached the green liquid around the tree's roots, she noticed its smell: sweet like overripe fruit mixed with a sharp sulfur scent.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZGY2MmY5MTg3NTRlYmViZGNiODA5ZjI2ZDZkM2My"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"What is the green liquid?" she asked, though she suspected the answer.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmY2IyYWIzYWFiMDQ0ZmQ4ZWRkYmJiMGU3ODlhZDVh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"My watch says it's Helionite," he replied, watching the pool. "It seems this tree feeds off of it."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYjllMjRjZTk5YjRjNWU4YTU2YTU1NzYzMGYzN2I4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Rakshasa must have been growing trees like this one," Lorna said, disturbed at the thought of such a being living off what fueled humanity's nightmares. "Are you sure this is the right place?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MDVjNmRiNDEwMDQ5NWRhM2UwOGMzMGE3Nzk2ZjEz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I'm not sure, actually," Xin answered casually. "But the Rakshasa people have been fairly forward with us so far. If Vyom says this is the place, then I trust him."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNzA5MzViNmQ5OTQ5NTU5YmFkMmE5NjNjYmVkMTli"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna sighed and continued scanning the area as the wind howled through the grass and trees.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NjYyNDZjZmJkMjRkZTg5NzU4MzA2NTdiZmMwZjA0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Suddenly, a purple branch extended from the Bodhi Tree, holding her pendant. It glowed blue, revealing what had been hidden.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmM2NlN2RmYWM2MzQ0NmY4MWE4ZTY3N2FkZWM4Y2Vk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lines in the tree's bark began forming a face - serene and ancient, with half-closed eyes and a calm expression. The face had prominent cheekbones, a smooth forehead, and lips curved in a knowing smile.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OWM1MzE0MDE1NTQwMjQ5NDFmM2RkMGE4ZjIyZmVk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The face looked wise yet distant, like someone in deep meditation. The bark around the eyes was slightly wrinkled, with a long nose and flared nostrils. It seemed timeless, as if it had grown with the tree over thousands of years.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZjA5YTI5YWZiNjQ0NzZhYjRjMTliNzNhOTUwNmIz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Then Lorna realized - Moro wasn't inside the tree; Moro was the tree.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMmQ2MDgyZmFlMDQ4Y2I4YzRiZDA2MjYzNjg3OGUz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Xin," she whispered, staring at Moro's forming face. "This tree, it's alive."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYTQzYTcwOTAxZjQ5NDg4MWZhYjVmZWYyNGY0YjE4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">From beside her, Xin murmured, "The face. It looks like that of the ancient Buddha."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMDVjOTQxNGZjZTRiNWI4OWFkYzFhZmNhZTkzNmU0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Moro's voice echoed in their minds, deep and amused. "Kathrin has informed me of your visit," he stated. "But I am not Buddha the Awakened One. The ideas that gave rise to your sages and gods are not unique to Earth, child. Your journey as a species is but one branch on a vast tree."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMzc3NThlNjhhODQyNDJhYWUwZjA0NjIxMjVlNjZk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna stepped closer, searching Moro's bark for any hidden intention. "So, you lead the Rakshasa Horde? Are you a Radi-Mon?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZDY0MzJjN2YyMTQ2YjFiNTY0ZTg5Y2RkNzllYWM1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Moro's expression shifted. "The Rakshasa Horde has thrived throughout millennia without a dictator. I advise young Kathrin and Vyomendri as they coordinate the Sholo-Yu that follow our way."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZTY2NTljMzEyNDQ0YmNiNTZlNGM2MmE2YTBlNjlk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Do you owe allegiance to Skarn?" Lorna pushed firmly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Yzk2OGMyMTU0MzRlNWViOWU2MjFiMjA1MWVmZjIx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I existed long before Skarn even took his first breath, child. Sholo-Yu like us - what your people call Radi-Mons - were created by a larger collective consciousness with a mission to consume the Helionite produced by civilizations that have discovered cold fusion," replied Moro, his deep voice rumbling slowly. "But so far, young Skarn's Fenris Horde has left this system untouched. Kathrin assures me that our hordes have maintained a respectful distance from each other."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNjY1NTJjN2VlNDQzZTZhOTkzYmJkNTcyNzhhM2I1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"How or where do you obtain your Helionite?" Xin asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1M2YxNTQ1ZWIyYjRiMzg4MTlmYTg0MWQ3MzMxN2Fj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"In the previous eon, this system was home to a society that utilized cold fusion. We co-existed peacefully until they tried to enslave us. My horde retaliated and assimilated them," Moro explained, his words carrying psionic energy.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNzc3YTc1Mjg4MTRlYzU4ZWY0NzQ3Zjg1MDJkYmJh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Assimilated?" Lorna raised an eyebrow.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjQxYjJiYzk4MTRjMTRhYjU3YzhjYWE0MTAyM2Ex"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Until recent centuries, we've been self-sufficient. But the Zephyrium reserves across our planets and moons are depleting quickly. Draugs like Vyom sometimes venture to the Sol System to retrieve Helionite. Through occasional trading and interaction with a scholar named Harald Omdal, we've become aware of the Moondust Crystal."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOWYwYTFkODRmOTQwMGRiODRkMTM0OTkxNzViNWRi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin moved closer to the tree, looking wary but curious. "So, the Moondust Crystal," he said carefully. "What can you tell us about it?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MjU4Y2FiMmU5YjRlYzBiYTQzMzg4NmNkZTRmM2Vh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Moro seemed to acknowledge his question. "A tool meant to contain and mold the psionic potential of entire species," he said. "Crafted by the Nirbohs to keep your ancestors from becoming what the Hivemind has become. Yet, even the Nirbohs misjudged the fires of creation."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOTg0ZmU3NmRhMTRmNDNiNWM5NmRjZmM2NGRjMjk5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna folded her arms. "That was a lot of buzzwords you just spat out."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTZkOWZmM2ZmZjQ2OGE4OTdkY2U2MWIwYjI1OWE5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Crystal was made under the belief that Nirbohs alone should rule the cosmos," Moro's face remained still. "The universe would be a better existence if such an artifact was never created. Or deployed."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOGYwMTk0YzUwZTQ0ZDNhN2JjODhkOTBhYjllMTE0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"And yet, you took my pendant, knowing its jewel's a part of it," she said defiantly. "You want the Crystal, don't you? What's your game?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZWRkM2M2YzAwOTRjMTRhNzVlNTMzMDFmNDJlNDYz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Moro laughed, a sound like stones falling down a canyon. "I do not seek to use it, if such is your concern."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYjM0YmQ4MzlmNjQ5MWU4MzU3OTU2NzMwZDM0ZmE3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna stepped closer, the pendant's glow lighting her face. "If you don't plan to use it, give it back. It's mine."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYTA1NmI3MmEyZDQyN2ViNTkxY2EyNmVjMmRkOTZm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Ownership," Moro looked at her with an unreadable expression. "An honest and mortal expression I understand."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5N2UxNmM4NWNiNDRjODQ4YWFmZjZjOTUxMmU4ZGZh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">His branch lowered the pendant within her reach. The only sound was the pulsing Helionite at their feet.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYWI5MTg1YTRmMTQ1ZjY4MGY1MTEzMTAwNzFmZTlm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna reached for the pendant, noticing its blue jewel glow brighter as her fingers approached.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZWJhMTYxMTBiZDRiMzM4ZmMzNWQ5MmVkNzRmOTY5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">But when she tried to take it, Moro's branches wrapped around her, lifting her into the air. She screamed as the tree sap soaked through her clothes, spreading a cool, tingling feeling.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ODUzN2MzZjdmMjQ2ZjFhYmY2YjVmNWFlNDVlOTZm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Oh no you won't!" Xin pulled out his 10mm Magnum and aimed at Moro. Before he could fire, another branch grabbed him and lifted him beside Lorna. His gun fell to the ground.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMDU5NmNlNmJmZTQ0ODBhYTQ1YWExNTJlYmUyMjgy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Du dumme tre! Should've known this was a trap…" she spat, trying to sound calm. Moro studied them curiously before responding.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTRlMzQ0MzhhZTRhOTY5MzdmOGFkODhkMDRlYTA2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Those who created the Moondust Crystal sought to subjugate all Radi-Mons," Moro's voice echoed in their minds. "So enlighten me, Lorna Weiss. Why should I allow you Sol people to restore and deploy such a weapon?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NDBhNGVkNGQ2NzRlZmRhNDU3NTkzNGQ3MDA4ZjNm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna struggled against the branches, feeling the pendant now back around her neck.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNWIzMGU5OWViOTRlYzI5N2ZhZWI2YTM3YWI3Yzc5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She clenched her jaw and focused her psionic energy. "Let me go, or I'll kill you myself! I have the power!"</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZDQzY2JmMjFmODQ0ZDI4OGMyNDE4Y2Y5MTY4OGNh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Moro seemed amused. "You bluff, dear child. Your strength is impressive, but not enough to harm me."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NTA0MDA5MDI5MzRiYWJhN2RlZGVlOTBiZTYwOTBk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As he tightened his grip, Lorna felt her psionic energy draining. She panicked slightly. "We need the Crystal to stop the Fenris Horde. If we don't act, countless lives will be lost. It's the right thing to do."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMTkzNGVkZDg2NzQ3NjBiZDUxNDBlZjNlYjMyYjU5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Right or wrong," Moro said, "such subjective concepts hold no sway in the vast expanse of the universe. Why would the Rakshasa, safe here in the Realm of Eternal Bliss, involve ourselves in your remote and petty squabbles?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MjgzMzU1NjE2MzRhMWM5OWIwOTg2ZTZhZGMzMWFi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Fordi det er vår jævla verden!" Lorna's Norwegian accent thickened as she shouted, "Because it's our fucking world! And we will protect it!"</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMWRiMWJlOTRlZTQ4YWViMjZiODNhZjMxN2Y1MDI4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"And die trying, your kind will," Moro replied calmly. "I still see no reason for my horde to intervene. If you Sol people can't protect your own realms without relying on a Nirboh creation like the Crystal, perhaps it's time for your era to end."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDZlNDNhZGFlZjQ0OGQ4OGI0OTgxMmE4ZWIyODQ1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The wind roared as Lorna grew desperate.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMTY0YTY0ZWNiMTQ0YzBiZWJiNjdlZjUyYmFmM2Uw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"If the Fenris were to annihilate humans and claim the Sol, they would become your worst enemy," Xin said, meeting Moro's gaze. "They too consume Helionite, which you Rakshasa rely on. What's preventing them from turning on you?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MDFjZWRkNjZhMDQ5ZjE4NzkxZTc4ZmMzNGMwZDEz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna watched as Moro considered this. She held her breath, looking down at where her pendant used to be.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMzQ5OWE5N2Y4MTQ1NDI4Yjg4YWZjNGU5NmRjNDkw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Very well," Moro finally said, loosening his grip and extending his branches. He gently placed them on the purple grass, away from the Helionite pool.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYWE2MjMzNDJiMzRkNWI5MjNjODA1N2ZjOWY5ZGUy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The wind swirled around them as Moro's branches retreated.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZWMzZjEzMDM4MjRhM2Q5ZjEwNTJjOTljOGZhZDE3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I trust you understand not to use it against my people," The tree lowered a branch with her pendant. As she put it back around her neck, she felt safer.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZTgzMDk2NDI3NzRkMTNhYjc3MGM1ODQ1MjQyYmY4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I promise I won't," she whispered, barely audible over the wind. She glanced at Xin, who looked relieved.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZGRhZjVkMmVkZTQzNjZiNTkzYWUyNjZkY2ZmMmJl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Before they could speak more, a violet portal appeared, casting light across the grass. Vyomendri Nyāya and Kathrin Gwynn emerged, looking grave.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNDBiY2VjMTg3MTQxOTI5MTdmNzk1ZGUzZWI0OTNm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Primarch. There's been an attack on our moon!" Vyomendri exclaimed, his violet skin almost matching the portal. "The Fenris Horde is upon us!"</span></p>
<p class="cnNkM2Y1NmMzZDE3NTQxZTRiYzJjOGRjZGNmNzMxZDVj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Moro's face twisted with surprise. "Impossible. Skarn gave his word that Fenris would respect our territories."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNTU2MDE2ZDJiODQ2OTI5ZDM0ZjQ0ODZmNGE0MjM1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"They were sighted on Parivartan Ghas in the northern hemisphere. 'The Twisting Meadows', in you Sol people's tongue," Kathrin turned to Lorna, her serpentine body coiling anxiously. "Three Hatching Chambers have already been destroyed. They're targeting our Helionite reserves."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYzdlNWZhMjk5YzRmZmU5YmU3ZDYyYjUzNzBhZmRm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna narrowed her eyes. "I thought your hordes were cool with each other?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NWRlMTFmYmY4OTQzZTBhYjMyY2UyZWZkYmM5YjFh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"So did I," Vyomendri confirmed grimly. "I suspect it's due to the recent skirmishes in the Sol's Five Realms. I might have led a few operations which saw us aiding the humans."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMzdlZmQ3ZmJmZDQ3M2U4ZTM0OGZiNDc0YWIwMjYw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Vyomendri. How long have you been working with humans?" Moro demanded, his branches swaying.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTgwNTJhNTU3YTRmNjg5YmNiY2I3NTBlODRlMGY5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Vyom straightened. "For a decade now. They've been supplying us with extra Helionite straight from the Five Realms' fusion plants, as well as other resources and meat. In return, we aid them against occasional Fenris incursions. More efficient than having our Weavers scavenge small deposits."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxODk2Mzg1N2FkMzRhMzhhNjgyODU5NjhiYmU0MzAx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Fenris Horde knows how to travel between star systems?" Xin asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZWFlN2ZhNDUyZjQ3M2Q5NzA4NWJkYmQ3YWNjMWJm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Kathrin nodded, her white serpentine body reflecting the portal's light. "But not at such speed. I suspect they've managed to conjure a portal of their own."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMDUxMmM0MTg0NzQ1MDM4OGQ3OWU2OTNmZDcyNGM1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"What if," Lorna said, touching her pendant, "they're not just attacking your moon. They're sending you a message. Join them..."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMzNhNDAxMDQ5ZDQzOWI4ZDAyNjc3ODgzZmRiOGNl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Or be destroyed," Moro finished, his features hardening. "So be it. If Skarn chooses to break faith, then the Rakshasa Horde will answer in kind."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYTUxN2ZlNzY4OTQ3MzU4ZjVkZjc0OWZkMWI0OTcw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The wind carried distant battle sounds. The tension felt thick as storm clouds.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzY2VkODZmOTY3NjRjNWJiN2FkMDAzZDhlNzhjMmRk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Tanha has gathered her Jalraks in the Meadows," Kathrin told Moro, looking at Lorna. Her wet black hair fluttered in the wind. "Emmanuel is with her."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZmQ2NWRiZDVlNTQ2MzM5ZDA3NGRiMTUxNjU4MmE2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Moro said, "Then take Lorna Weiss and Zhi-Xin Wu with you. One has displayed bravery, the other wisdom – qualities that will be crucial in the battle to come."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NDQ0NGYwY2VhNTRhMWI5MmZjMGQ3ZTZlMjQ5ODU4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Space Rover," Xin said suddenly. "We can't leave it here."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYTZhYjU4YzNkZDQzYTNiMDZmMDVkNmU3MmZkNWMw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Kathrin smiled slightly. "Worry not. I'll have some Weavers retrieve it later. Right now, you must press on."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNTMzZTI1OGM4NTQ0NWFiYWM2YWQxODFlYzNjYWNk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Ready?" Lorna asked Xin as she reached inside her trench coat's pocket, drawing out the Psi Shield to affix it onto her ear. The device hummed to life, its silver shell glowing blue.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYWQxYWNhZWYxYjQxNGU4YmJlYzg4MTkzZDFkNWFk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Always," he replied steadily as he finished wearing his own Psi Shield, the gadget glowing verdant green. His hand found hers in the portal's light.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYTk3Y2Y5MjA4NzRiYzNhNWJjNDFlZGY0MTJhYzE1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As they approached the portal, Moro's voice echoed one last time: "Remember, children of Sol. The Rakshasa Horde does not choose its side in your war on a whim. Fight well."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0N2IyMzZjMzZhMTRjNjZiYmY0NTVlMGI5YzJiNjVl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">With that, they stepped through the portal, leaving the mountain for the chaos that awaited them.</span></p>
