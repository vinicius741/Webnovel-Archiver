<p class="cnNlZDQ0ZTk1ZWU2MjQ1Nzc5OTg3MDJiYzZhYzhlNzM5"><span style="font-weight: 400">The rest of the day, and that night, went more or less as expected, from Maeryn’s point of view. Terrance, Frankie and Peter returned shortly before sunrise, and reported that - to no one’s surprise - Stonewing</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">was being kept in a storage warehouse under heavy guard. They’d been able to sneak in, though, and discovered that the airship had indeed been sabotaged - the propellers had been entirely removed. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxNzI4MjU4NjI4ZTRiOGU4ZjYyMWNhMjExNGQ2NjBl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It won’t be hard to put them back on, but it’s not something that can be done quietly,” Frankie grumbled angrily, and Peter patted her on the back sympathetically. “We’d need… twenty minutes?” She glanced at Peter for a second opinion. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDViYzQ0NGFiYTRkM2U4YmU0NzA3Yzg4ZWMxMjBi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Better make it thirty. Might need to oil things up.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiMjIzNWFlZWY4ZjRiMGU5YzkzMzYwZmNkODljZmIy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Frankie nodded in concession. “Thirty minutes of uninterrupted time to get the propellers attached properly. And with the guard patrols, we’d be lucky to get five.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDM2MmRlZTM1ZTQ3MjFiOWU3NWFiYzlmMDI0MWE3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn narrowed her eyes, tapping her finger against the table as she mulled over the news. “You said it’s in a warehouse. Let’s assume for a moment that we do manage to get the propellers back on, and everyone aboard. Can we take off from there?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzZThmODYxMzIxYTQ4ZDNiZjBjMDc1MDYwY2ZhNTZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not directly,” Peter denied. “Not enough runway space. We’ll need to take it down the warehouse road to the airfield proper and take off from there.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NzhlZTNjOTE2YjRhYjA5OTMyOGRmNTM4MDJiNTRl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance shook his head. “There are too many guards, day or night, to fly Stonewing out of there stealthily. Not unless we knock everyone unconscious first, and that’s both time-consuming and sure to get us noticed in a hurry.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyOGVhZDYyOWEwNTRjNmJhZWI0NGEyNTA0MjZmODQx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn frowned. “From the sounds of it, there are enough obstacles that the chances of us successfully stealing Stonewing are too low to consider.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTUxMGI3NjlmMDQ2NzBhOWE1ZDE1OWVhYTFhN2Vi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance grimaced, but nodded. “I came to the same conclusion,” he admitted. “I’m confident in my skills, don’t get me wrong, but they’ve put in some serious effort to prevent us from getting that airship.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTdhMGNlOTk2ZTRjZmU5NWU4ZmQzYzBhYWU2ZTI0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then… that takes us to trying things legitimately,” Maeryn mused, looking upwards in thought. “Our conflict with the ZRC notwithstanding, we were grounded because of royal decree. If we can solve Samuel Parlor’s murder, then they won’t be able to justify holding onto our airship.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZGVlY2QxNjQ3MjRmNjk5YmNjYWI0ZDY3ZWFkMTY1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance held up his hands as if to ward off Maeryn’s train of thought. “Hold on, you can’t be serious. Didn’t you say that Marshall was sure this was noble politicking? The noble families won’t even meet us, and it’s not like the local tax office has records saying which family employed so-and-so as an assassin.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjgwN2RhNWMzODQzZTM4NmVlYzM1ZTQxYzgyNTRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn’s lips curled into a confident smirk. “But we’ve got a tool that Marshall doesn’t. We can speak to Parlor himself. We do that, and we might be able to get somewhere.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhNDc2MWYzYjcyYTQzMDQ5NWI5MTQxOGVlMThiNjEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">The noble rogue’s face twisted in discomfort. “Maeryn, I’m really uncomfortable with this plan. Ernesto using necromancy for…for his cheese, ridiculous as it sounds, is one thing. And I understand that he needs to explore the other aspects of his power in order for him to invert necro mana. I’ve come to terms with that. I don’t like it, but I’ll deal with it. But Maeryn… this… casually calling spirits from the other side… it’s wrong, isn’t it? I mean, it’d be different if Parlor had, I don’t know, given his consent before he died? But… we don’t know what summoning spirits </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">does </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">to them. ” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlYmQxMGM4YjRjMTQyNDY5NDJiYmU4Y2FkNjRiYjI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn’s smirk faded as Terrance spoke, and when he finished, she frowned thoughtfully. “I hear what you’re saying. But, a few counterpoints.” She raised a finger. “Parlor got us involved, not the other way around. The only reason we’re grounded is because he got himself killed, and the royal family got involved. We can’t exactly interrogate the royal family about this.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwYjIyZDM3ZjkzNDQ4MWFiMmYyMmE0M2UyMTEyOWVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance gave a theatrical shudder. “I should think not.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjMTEyNWNmZTMzNTRiZDk5Y2Q3MDViYzhmYTY5YTk1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn raised a second finger. “Next, put yourself in Parlor’s shoes. Suppose someone managed to assassinate you and get away with it, and we were investigating your death. Wouldn’t you want the truth to be known? Even if it meant some discomfort or something? Do you really think you could, I don’t know, rest in peace before your killer faced justice?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5MzdmYzBjZGM5MjRjYTM5ZTJlMmFhOWE3Yjg4NGQx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance made a face, but it was obvious he was considering it, even though he didn’t immediately reply.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZmIxN2QyMmUzNTQ0YTk5NTZhNGFkYjk4NGFiMTFl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thirdly…” Maeryn raised another finger. “We can just ask Keith. Ernesto’s already summoned him before. You could hear it directly from a spirit whether being summoned hurts them or something.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlNGVmN2Y5Yzg3YTQ0MDc4MmVjNGNjM2E1ODI0YWEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance let out a long sigh. “That’s fair, I suppose. I just never had a chance to ask. I arrived after Keith vanished the other night.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhNzg0YzM0ODdlZTRiNGI5YjJjNmNmODMzNzQwZTA3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And finally…” Maeryn lifted a fourth finger and smirked. “Do you really think that Ernesto would ever use a spell that hurts people beyond self-defense?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyMTU4MWFhZTRhMjRjMTliODFlYWI1YmIxMjRkN2Ux"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance blinked. After a few seconds of processing the question, he couldn’t help it; he burst into laughter. Maeryn waited patiently for him to get control of himself, and eventually the rogue wiped tears of mirth and relief from his eye. “Why didn’t I think of that? That guy’s way too gentle.” He shook his head. “Alright. Let’s have necro-cheese-boy summon Keith and get some confirmation that everything’s fine, and then yeah. Let’s hear what Parlor has to say.” </span></p>
<hr/>
<p class="cnM1OTQ2NGNkMGVlZTQxYWJiOGFlNjhjZjQzZDY0MzJk"><span style="font-weight: 400">It didn’t take long to confirm with a freshly-summoned Keith that no, simply being called by a necromancer didn’t hurt and absolutely did not do nefarious things to the soul. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmODY5MzI2ODAwYjRlOTdiYzc0M2VkZmNmZjQzZjU2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why in the world would we injure a soul that we want to work with us?” Keith asked blankly. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDgyMGYyOTNlOTQ2NjFiZTkxYjQyMDZhODYxNjgz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance opened his mouth to reply, then closed it, unable to articulate an answer that was more logical than “because you’re evil.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM4MDllNzIxM2YxYjRjZDQ4OGFjZmJkYjIzZjY1ZGZl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And besides, we all die eventually. Why would we develop spells that would harm our afterlife?” the ghost sounded simultaneously insulted and baffled by the question. “It’s a terrible idea. Some upstart finds a grimoire, and learns a spell to magically bind a ghost into their slave? Oh no, the necromancer who made the spell is suddenly ripped from their afterlife and forced to serve an idiot.” Keith rolled his eyes in utter exasperation. “Spare me. There is a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">reason </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">why Spirit spells are purely for communication and exploration. No one who makes it very far into necromancy lacks the intelligence to see how shortsighted developing a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">harmful </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Spirit spell would be.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzNTlmNDA5NGI5YzQxZjc4YTMzYmUwNjY1M2QyN2Ri"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance felt distinctly like a moron at that moment, and he really didn’t like it. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0MjA3MDA1YWQ2ZTRmNzhhMDk3NGI1YjNiOGU1M2Fi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And even if someone with more ambition than brain </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">did </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">make a spell like that, do you really think that the spell would survive very long? It’s difficult for the dead to interact with the living without a necromancer, but not impossible.” Keith rolled his head around as if to pop his neck. “If I were to really put some effort in, maybe with some help from sympathetic spirits, I could minorly affect the world. Leave a message on a mirror, perhaps. Shift a lit candle off a ledge and start a fire. I wouldn’t be able to do it often - such a thing would be massively draining - but I could if I felt strongly enough about what I was doing. Emotions are power to the dead, and the dead being harmed by a necromancer would be a fast way to have an untimely accident.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmNGQxZjgwNjZjMzRjNGQ4MzZiZTgzY2NjYjYyZDg0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, now Terrance was going to have an entirely different set of nightmares. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyM2QyYTNhYmNhZTQzM2RiMDFjOThmY2E5NjdiNTQ0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think you’ve made your point, teacher,” Ernesto interjected when Keith opened his mouth to continue his lecture-rant. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkMzM2OGI3NDg1ZDQxZmRiMDAyOWVlNTk1MzYxMDE0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I certainly hope so! Good grief. ‘Does being summoned hurt you?’ If I didn’t know that it was asked out of genuine concern and desire to understand… I’m heading to the library. Someone attend me to turn the pages.” Continuing to grumble, Keith floated off. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmODBjYWVjYmM1ZDRhNDQ4MDNlMzAxNjRiMWYyMTEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">The six living humans looked at each other. “Not it!” Frankie yelped. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0YjA1N2JhMmZlMDQ4MTM5YzM5NTZkZGI4MTJkNGQ4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not it!” Peter joined in a split second later, and everyone quickly followed. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzOTJmOGI0ODg4MTQ5MjFiMDFjYzk0NjUxMTQ4Njhh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Blight!” Dan swore, realizing he was the last one. He groaned and reluctantly headed off. “You guys owe me for this!” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiODhmYjQ5NDk3ZjQ5MzZiMDZmZDE0NmNmY2U0NzE3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your sacrifice will be remembered!” Maeryn called out to him, receiving a rude nonverbal gesture in response. She cracked a grin, shaking her head. “Alright. Any objections to summoning Parlor?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyMjRiM2UwODUwOTQxNTFhOTcyMWU1ZDY2NjMzN2Rj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not anymore,” Terrance admitted, thoroughly disgruntled. “Now I just feel like an idiot.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzNzgwMDRmZWE3ZDRhODY4MWVhYjA4NDRlMjZkMTA0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Frankie patted him on the shoulder sympathetically. “Believe me, you’re not alone in that. Necromancy’s, well, still spooky, but less ‘path to ultimate evil’-sounding now, isn’t it?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM1MGJkNmZhMGI2ZjRhY2ZiYmRlY2UyYzczOTg3Mzk5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m right here, you know,” Ernesto commented pointedly. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxYjYzYjNjOTgxZDQzOTFhZTNlYzZhMmJmMzFjYzE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Frankie waved him off. “You know what I mean. The Undead thing.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwY2M4OTJkMGMwNTRmZDdiZDYzYTExODQ3NTNjZTAx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto let out a long-suffering sigh. “Maybe I ought to summon the spirit of the idiot who ruined things for the rest of us when he did stupid things with the Undead. Give him a lecture. Or better: let Keith give him a lecture.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3MmVlYTI4MDFhNjRjN2Y4OTc3MzA5NDkzYzc3MjEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn let out an unwilling snort of laughter. “Let me know if you ever decide to do it. I’d love to be there. But for now, Samuel Parlor, if you please.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZWI5MDRiZDJiYjRkOWU4N2YwMDI3MTFmNmVkOGRi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto gave a determined nod. “This one will be harder. I don’t know him personally, and vice versa. I’ll need to use you as a conduit, Maeryn. Considering you were directly hired by him, and his death is directly impacting you specifically, I should be able to connect to his spirit that way.” </span></p><span class="cjFjZjA5M2RiZjdiODRhM2Q4MWVkYjdlNmY5ZmVlMzU2"><br/>If you stumble upon this tale on Amazon, it's taken without the author's consent. Report it.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNmMjI4MDE4MzNmZTQ4YWFhZWE5ZmNkMDQ1YWU1OWY5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn stiffened, then let out a slow breath. “Do what you have to do.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0Yjk0OGY0ZjhjNTQyYzNhZDYzMTFiZWM1ZWQxNzE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright. Here we go. Sit down, across from me.” The necromancer fell into a cross-legged sitting position on the floor, and Maeryn mimicked him. “Now just stay there. This’ll take a little time to find the right connection. I’ll be saying his name repeatedly while looking at your spiritual tethers to see if one of them reacts, but it’d be helpful if you focus on what you know of him.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM4Y2I1NjE0YjA1MTRjNDU5ZGIxNjczOWViOWZjMDE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhMDFiYWU0ZjA5NDQ0ZTdiZWFlNTQwMzQ0ZTIyMGM4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto took a deep breath and closed his eyes. When he opened them again, they shone an icy, ethereal blue. “Samuel Parlor,” he murmured, staring directly at Maeryn. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiZjBkZTY3ZGQxNzRjNzViMzMzMzU0NjJkYjU4Mzkz"><span style="font-weight: 400">The hunter felt distinctly uncomfortable having clearly magical eyes staring at her, but did her best to put it out of her mind, closing her eyes and thinking about Parlor. The way he moved, the sword at his hip. His distant, removed way of speaking… </span></p>
<p class="cnM2YzFiNmMyNTk5MzQ0ZjJhNDQzOGNkZWY4NWMxY2Y0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Samuel Parlor.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNjA4YmUwMGIzMDQ3MjJiMzRlMGJhZGNmMjE4Mzgz"><span style="font-weight: 400">… how Parlor had claimed that he preferred quiet and solitude instead of distractions, how Parlor had quickly and efficiently dropped them off at the hotel and left again to ensure separation between himself and those under his employ…</span></p>
<p class="cnM1N2ZkZTRlMmU3ZDRiNzRiYTkzZjJhM2E3ZDZlMTMz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Samuel Parlor,” Ernesto called for a third time. “Come forth.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjMGNiYzMxMTE5YTQ0YjU4YzQ3NTM2MzE4ZWVmMWM1"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a feeling, a microscopic tug in a direction that Maeryn couldn’t describe, and suddenly the air grew cold once more. Maeryn opened her eyes again to see the man in question floating between Ernesto and himself. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjZWM3YzMyYjdmMTQ2MWFhNWM3MmU1NDNiZjJkYWEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is this…?” Parlor asked, confusion clear in his tone before he seemingly collected himself. “I see. A necromancer. How unexpected.” He drew himself up, meeting first Ernesto’s gaze, and then Maeryn’s. “Well, then. Why have you summoned me? I assure you, I will not assist in any necromantic plots.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzYmE2YWNmYTk1ZjQyN2ZiZDg3NmM3ZTY4ZjdhOTNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing like that,” Maeryn rushed to reassure him, quickly scrambling to her feet. “A lot’s happened. After you died, the royal family got involved, and we were barred from leaving Zephyr.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjYzBjNzUwM2NjYTRjNmU4MDMzZGU0ODk3NzI1Mjc3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Parlor nodded once briskly. “To be expected. I was a retainer to the royal family. And?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OTBlMjk1ZmU4MjQ1NDg5MDM0ZTY1OWYyMTkyNmMy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And we’d like to leave Zephyr,” Maeryn replied simply. “And the fastest way to do that is to solve your death. The authorities have gotten nowhere, so we figured we’d just ask you. Who killed you? What happened?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiZGFkNmY4ZTFhYTRiOTNiMzdhMmM0ZjE4NjkyZjc3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Parlor looked at her intently for several long seconds. “I do not know the name of the assassin who killed me. I do know who was behind them, and why. But I don’t understand why it’s so urgent for you to leave, so important that you would risk summoning me. Even if the authorities aren’t able to solve my murder, the case would be closed in a matter of weeks. A month at most.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmYjgyZmI3YTZkYTRmMGM4Yzk4N2E2YjcxYjllZDM2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Putting aside the cost of actually living in Zephyr and the inability to use our airship to support ourselves in the interim,” Maeryn began pointedly, receiving no reaction from the deceased noble, “it’s urgent because the Zephyr Research Council is after me and my crew. Because we killed their pet Undead in Airspire.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhYWFhOTUyYjY4NDRmNjZiZGI4MzM3ZGZlNDg2ZDZh"><span style="font-weight: 400">That visibly startled the man. “Truly?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlMTYxNzgzOTU1NDQxODRiYjQ1ZjI2YTJiMjA2MWQ0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn raised her right arm and extended the blade from her vambrace. “Truly. They already kidnapped my crew once, and I had to break into their headquarters to get them out. I don’t particularly want to give the ZRC any more chances to get at me or my crew. And, even disregarding that, my crew has a mission to end the Mist threat. Ernesto, the necromancer behind you, is key to that.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiODE3NjkxODJhMjQ1NGU4NzA0OGEzNmY4ZTJmMmM2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Parlor narrowed his eyes. “Tell me.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZTg3MDA2ZTU3YTQzMDVhMmZlNWRhN2I1ODIzZGJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">So Maeryn explained everything. How the Undead produce the Mist, and their efforts to create inverted necro mana to deal with the Mist. How they’d encountered Keith Laurant as an Undead in Airspire, and how he’d revealed that the ZRC knew about the Undead-Mist connection for years. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDBmYzA5OTc0ZDQzNDg4YjdjNGE1OWY2MjU0OTJk"><span style="font-weight: 400">After she finished, Parlor nodded. “I see. It seems your story is intertwined with mine in unexpected ways.” He paused, considering his words. “I was appointed by the royal family to be the leader of a secret task force investigating the Zephyr Research Council. There were suspicions of corruption, of the ZRC attempting to use the Mist crisis as a method of seizing power. This fear became more prevalent as mana depletion continued. My findings in Airspire were inconclusive, but there were oddities in the audit that are neatly explained by the presence of an underground facility and experiments with an Undead.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOWRmZWVjOWVmMzQwOGE4NDY0OWJlOTc3MmI1MWM3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Parlor shook his head. “I hired you to transport me to Zephyr not simply for a business deal, but to convey my findings to the royal family in secret. However… it seems they discovered me.” He hung his head. “I was unprepared for the ZRC’s assassin. How shameful.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNkNGVjZGQ0MzZlNDQxMDc4NmRjODFlZDE1MzQ5Njk0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn grit her teeth. “Okay. We’ve got a common enemy, and a common cause. We need to alert the royal family and get their help to take care of the ZRC, right?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNzkwZmM2ZjI3ZTQ0MDFiMGFiZGY5Mjg1OGY1NjYx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That would be ideal, but I frankly do not see a method for you to do so without revealing your necromancer crewmember,” Parlor stated matter-of-factly. “My report was stolen upon my death, and likely was destroyed.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MTE3MWUzYTc1MDQxMDZhOGViYzEwOWEwYTk3YjA5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn raised one hand to her chin, thinking furiously. “What if I claimed that you took me into your confidence as a precautionary measure, just in case the ZRC got you?” she proposed. “Sure, the report’s been destroyed, but if there was something I could use to convince the royal family… some secret, a code, a phrase, anything…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNDRkMmRhNDZmZDQ4MmY4MDQ3ZDQ2ODliNDM2OWQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alas, I have nothing like that… my apologies.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZWQwMmZlNzEwMTQ3ZTdiY2EwY2M5YTUyMTc4ZGEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What if I forged your report in your hand?” Terrance suddenly suggested. “If I could get a sample of your handwriting, you could dictate your report and I could recreate it. Then Maeryn could make her way to the royal family and pass it along, saying that you’d given her a copy in case of the worst.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM4MDJmOTgwMTM1MjRlZmQ5MDFmYjljZjQyMmUyODVm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Parlor paused, reaching up to stroke his beard thoughtfully. “That idea… has promise. Yes. It could work.” He looked past Maeryn to where Terrance was standing. “Although I question where your skill in forging comes from.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmODQ5OThjNjlkNjRiNGU5NTdiMzk3ZjE2MmU5YzRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance looked at him defiantly. “I am Terrance Nightshade, last of my line. I was to be the next Nightingale before my family was destroyed. Of course I know how to forge handwriting.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5NzVhNzE5MjYwNTQxNDFiZmQ4YTYwOTljMDVjMDRl"><span style="font-weight: 400">The ghost looked absolutely stunned by this news, and then a broad smile stretched across his face, making him look a decade younger. “A Nightshade lives? Praise the sun, that’s the best news I’ve heard in years. Yes, absolutely, let us find a sample of my handwriting. The sooner this is done, the better.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmY2IxYzI4OTFkYjQwMjRiNDdiOGYyOTQ1OGJhZDM3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You suddenly got cooperative,” Frankie observed in surprise. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkMGFkNjJkYmY2ODRhMmZiNzBhZmMyNzUxMDhmNGVh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, of course! He’s a Nightshade! I don’t know how I didn’t see it before, he has a striking resemblance to his father.” Parlor shook his head in wonder. “If he and Captain Maeryn approached the royal family together, that would give my report legitimacy. It makes perfect sense to entrust a report of such gravity to a Nightingale, and it neatly explains anything that the royal family might question. You have given me an opportunity to succeed where I failed, and finish my duty to my country. How can I do anything less than give my best efforts?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyNmYxNjZhMzhiYTQ1OGZhY2Q4N2Q1ZjY3OWE5NDhk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance rolled his head, cracking his neck as he stepped forward to stand side by side with Maeryn. “Alright then. Where are we going?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiMThiYTA2Yzc2MTRlMDNiODYxMjUyNTgxMzAxMjU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">The specter frowned, visibly considering and discarding various ideas before settling on one. “You are most likely to succeed by infiltrating the house of Charles Camlus. It was he that I was in proceedings with for our business deal. We wrote each other repeatedly over the last few months; he should still have the letters in his home.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwN2I3YjlhMWZiZjQwNzE4NzY1ZjhkMmExM2QwNzdi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn frowned. She hadn’t heard of Charles Camlus, but she still felt like she was forgetting something. She glanced at Terrance. “Are you familiar with their family?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzYTEyNzNhNjQ1MTQzY2ZiNWIzYWE1OWQ0M2E5Y2Jj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance shook his head. “Remember, I was eight when I was stranded on Cloudreach. My parents hadn’t taught me much about the other nobles.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZGM1MGUzMTc2YjQ1MTM4MzNiYTI4ZjFhNDIzZDkw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then allow me to educate you,” Parlor stated firmly. “The Camlus family are nobles that deal in supply and distribution of alchemical goods. Reagents, potions and such. They are not the only family that does so, of course, but they have managed to establish recognition for consistent quality. I believe the Nightshades had a trade agreement with them regarding the cultivation of certain plants, though I’m unfamiliar with the details.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjYjY0NTgxYmVhMzQ3ZTBiMGRjNjgxZDc5ZTc5ZTc0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone took a moment to let those details settle, before Terrance leaned in, apparently ready to continue. “Could you guide us to the Camlus estate tonight? After dark?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM4YzgzYWY3YzZlYTRkNDNhNzZkZjhjNzQwNjYxNzNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Certainly. It would be my pleasure. I always wondered how a Nightingale operated…” Parlor looked vaguely excited at the idea, too; Maeryn would swear that she saw a sparkle in the ghost’s eyes, but that was impossible. Right? </span></p>
<p class="cnM3YWYyMTJmZTdjOTRjMmM5OTg1OTYyNDEwNjk4ODZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn let out a long breath, shaking her head wryly. “Another late night operation, huh. At this point I might as well just start sleeping during the day.” She clapped her hands once, ensuring all attention was on her. “Alright, people! We’re doing a three-man - and one ghost - team tonight. Ernesto, Terrance, Parlor and I will be infiltrating the Camlus estate tonight. Frankie, Peter, you two did great last night. Good work, get some rest. Terrance, make sure you’re ready for tonight and then get some damned sleep. You’ll need it for tonight. Ernesto, you and I are going to stay awake a little while longer so we can bring Dan up to speed and give Keith a chance to finish his book - no point in making a ghost cranky from leaving a book half-read - but make sure you get some rest this afternoon. Any questions? No? Get moving.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5MGFiNjgxMTgwNjRhNWU4NWIyYzZkNTZkNTUzMTY5"><span style="font-weight: 400">She got a variety of responses, all various forms of “Yes, Captain,” and soon enough she was left alone with Parlor in the study. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxMTliNzMxODYwZTRiZTFhN2U4MDU1MjE5NTU5NDY4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You lead them well,” Parlor observed. “How long have they served under you?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMxMTRiNzRkNDA4ZDQxZTU5YTY3YWMwMjYyYjBiOTQz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Depends on your definition, I guess. Frankie and Dan have been working with me for years. Terrance and Ernesto, a few weeks. Peter just started last week.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwZDllMTQ3ODgzZjQ1NGY5Y2UxMmFlNTczNTdhNmNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Parlor’s eyebrows raised in subtle surprise. “You command quite a bit of respect from them.” His voice carried something that Maeryn felt like she should recognize. Something like respect, or approval, or… whatever it was, Maeryn certainly didn’t feel like she deserved it. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjMjlmM2IyNjc4YjQ4OGI4OTA3NGE0YjIwMzAyMjA3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn slumped against a wall. Now that there was no one else to see, she could stop pretending that she was completely put together. “It’s the only thing I can do. That’s my role here. Keeping everyone working together and helping figure out the plan. Actually making it happen is up to them.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOTI0YjJhZTFkOTRiODQ5NzczMGQ2NzZlMzY0MDU4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Such is the nature of leadership,” Parlor commented neutrally. “But they would not follow you if you were incapable.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZTU3NzgwY2U2MzQ3MDA5ZDNmNWYwY2I2MDhjNjdh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn paused, mulling over that statement. It sounded right, but she wasn’t sure she believed it. “What do you mean?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhNDI0ZTBlNjMyMzRlNWNhNThjYTc5ZmIyNzA2ZDI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Parlor hummed, trying to put together what he wanted to say. “You spoke of roles in the team. Suppose one of your colleagues was the Captain, instead of you. Who would you think would do best?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwNmU4MWFiZmNmNzQwMmZiMzJjMWY4NmJkYTNjNWFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Dan,” Maeryn responded instantly. “He’s the alchemist and mana researcher on the team. We never would have put together that the Undead create the Mist without him. And he’s got leadership experience, too, from his time with the Alchemical Workshop in Geova.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzNTQ4ZjMzYmRhZTRlODZhN2NjY2JiZmExOWMzNmU2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And do you think,” Parlor began with a raised eyebrow, “that he has the charisma necessary to bring all the disparate personalities of your crew together?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwNDk0OTFiMWU0ZjRjNWQ5YjAxZTgxNDZhMmQ1MmJk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn opened her mouth, ready to say “yes”, but… had to close her mouth after a moment. She remembered Dan and Terrance’s heated argument back on Cloudreach… an argument only broken when she’d intervened. She remembered Dan’s reluctance to get involved with a sobbing Ernesto who had just lost his Master back on Mount Peace. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyNGE5YTJlOWFmZjRhZjk5YTA2Nzc2NGQ0ZTE1MDM1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe not,” she admitted slowly, softly. She was still reluctant to think that she was the best one for the job, but… </span></p>
<p class="cnNkNDRjZDdlNTU5NDQwYzNiMTdiNWQzNzUyZDI5NTNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">As if reading her mind, Parlor pressed the point. “What of the others of your crew? Would any of them be capable of taking command?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZDc5ZDFmOTNiMDQwYzM4OGRjOTk5ODMyZWY5YTE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn’s mind whirled through the possibilities. Ernesto? Surely not. He was too timid to start with, still in the throes of grief and trying to live up to his Master’s expectations. And as a necromancer, he would have been severely handicapped in being respected enough. Peter was out of the question, too new and too shy. Frankie was too wrapped up in her steam engineering and piloting, and didn’t have the interest or patience to deal with anything else. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxN2U3YzE3ZmVmNDRlZThhZDc0Yjc4NmQ0OWEzOTlh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance? He… could be a capable leader, perhaps. But he was awfully withdrawn, and had told Maeryn outright that he preferred not to owe anything to anyone. And with his backstory, of betrayal and loss, he wouldn’t have done well trying to connect to anyone. Any hope of cooperation with a necromancer would have died instantly. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzI0ZmVhMWYyYzQ4ODc4YWZlM2U2MGM1M2RlZTFm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No,” Maeryn whispered, a small sense of awe growing within her. “No, none of them.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzZDg4YTE5M2I4NTQ5ZTE5NGY1ODA2M2FhYjQ4NWZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Parlor nodded solemnly. “To be a good leader demands certain qualities. It appears to me that you meet the criteria quite well. Take heart; the role of Captain suits you, Captain Maeryn. Now lead us to victory.” </span></p>
