<p class="cnNjOGViYjZlMDcxNDRhNzNiYzRkOGNhMDVkNmNkOGNh"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">87F, Amber Moon Spire (琥月塔), ZenFusion Taipei branch, No. 7, Section 5, Xinyi District, Taipei, Taiwan, Imperium of Dragons territory</span></p>

<p class="cnMyN2I0ZGZkZWNmNDQ4Y2U5MjBlOTZmZDA0NWVlZTg4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><span style="font-size: 1.5em"><strong>F</strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400">or generations, his people had been held captive in their own land. But they were content with their oppressive overlords of the Imperium. Everything was fine as long as they followed the rules and made money. Freedom was never needed. Or so they were told.</span></span></p>
<p class="cnNjYTRlM2E5NDA3ZTQ4OWFiYTQ3NTY0NzhjYWU4N2Ji"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">The woman's scream pierced through Zhi-Xin Wu's noise-canceling headphones. He adjusted the volume on his workstation, but the Bloodtrooper supervisor had locked the audio at minimum twenty percent.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMDJlNTJhY2I2ODRmNTRiYmE5YzI4NmUzOGJiZmUy"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Behind his black-rimmed glasses, Xin's features tensed with each new scream. The black of his short cropped hair, the white dress shirt and charcoal vest he wore showed him as another corporate drone in ZenFusion's ranks. At forty, he was now a Senior Software Engineer in Data Solutions, his skinny frame and the dark circles under his eyes showing what it meant for someone to even make it this far in their career.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Yjg4YTE2MTkyMTRkMWFhM2NiMDBmNjc1NTRlN2Vj"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Through the surveillance display next to his terminal, Xin watched Dilinur Altai work.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOGY2NGMwY2E1NzRhNWY4MzYzNDZkMTBmNWU2YzFk"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Crystal's location," Dilinur's alto voice came through. "You've spent enough time playing the martyr."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Y2VkOWU1NTdmMzRkMzliNzY5ZGIwNmFkOGNlNDdj"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the 87th floor, the city looked ominous but ironically beautiful. Dominated by the iconic pagoda-shaped tower of ZenFusion's headquarters, while smaller skyscrapers clustered around it like courtiers around an emperor.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYzJmY2QwYWFlYzQwZTM5ZDY4M2ZhODUxZDU0NzFh"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin's fingers flew over his workstation, where multiple holographic interfaces floated. The central display projected a three-dimensional interface, shifting. Secondary screens surrounded him in a semicircle, running different monitoring protocols.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YjUyOWEzMTMxYjQ4OTFhM2VhYmM0NmRjMmQ5ZTli"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Another scream. The rebel's skin was beginning to bubble as Dilinur touched her.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OWY2NmNjZjBlOTQ5YTNiYzQ3YTYxOTc5ZTU2ZmVh"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"This is the eighth hour," the rebel said between gasps. "Your Imperium...may have taken over Taiwan. Broken it…but by Buddha, you shall not break me!"</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYzNiODkzY2I0NjRhYzZiZGJjZDEyZDEyOGRjNTU5"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Nine hours would be excessive," Dilinur threatened softly. "We'll finish in eight."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZmJiNjkxZDdmOTQxYjA4OTJmZGQ2NzE5NTc4Y2Vh"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Looking down through the floor panels beneath his feet, Xin could see tubes of luminescent green Helionite cycled to the building's lower levels for storage. Behind him, a Zephyrium shard the size of his fist pulsed with orange and blue light in its containment chamber, powering the Amber Moon Spire.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYjk5YzA0ODNlMzQzMmM5MjJhNGY0NjdiNjcyYTFk"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Around Xin, rows of other engineers worked, all pretending not to hear the torture session being broadcast to their workstations.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlODZmZDQwZDdmYzRmZTM4MjhhNzRkMWIyNzMyOGY0"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"We won’t." the rebel shot back.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOTRjZDg3ZDY2NDQ1YjI4M2NmYjE3MDM3YmJlZjY0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><span style="font-weight: 400">"You Sand Lotus lunatics are stubborn. Let’s see…" Dilinur said, her following sentence feeling more powerful. "</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Maa-nik-ya Yaa-ta-naa.</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">"</span></span></p>
<p class="cnNiZTAwM2VjN2IwODRjMGRhNzVjM2YyMjM2YWE0YTk0"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">The rebel's next scream came with a wet gurgling sound. Xin looked at the surveillance display. Dilinur had activated an Eclipse spell, her fingers weaving crimson patterns that pulled at the woman's blood vessels, visible through her skin like dark rivers.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OGIyOWExZWU0NzQzYjg4NDUxZDFhNjRmMmZiM2E1"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Somewhere on Osram," the rebel choked out. "The Crystal... it's on—"</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNWQ5MjMxZGQzYTQwMGViYTUzMTNkNmI5NDkyMGVh"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Specifics!" Dilinur commanded. "Or the next hour will feel significantly longer than the previous seven."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDMzZDdiMWI4NDQwNGE5NWM5N2ZlZGM5NGNmMGI1"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin's hands trembled over his keyboard. He was supposed to be documenting this. Instead, he found himself wondering how many others had disappeared into rooms like this, how many of his own people had screamed their last under the Imperium's ministrations.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YWMwNDdkZTZiMDRhZjc4ZWUxZmZlYmYzODcxYjc1"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Wu-san," a tired voice called from next to him. "I did it."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ODcyMDA3NDg1NTQ5YjJiNjNjNDU2Y2RjZjc0NDg0"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin turned to see Nakamura's weathered face lit by the glow of various machines running around them. The middle-aged man was holding up a holographic document.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZjYwOGNlNTZjYjQ5ZWI5ZWU3ZDIyZjBiZWQzNzQ0"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"The loan papers?" Xin asked, trying distrcat himself from the interrogation feed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNTcxYjczN2Y1ZTQyYzc4YzY3NjUyY2JjNjc4NWYz"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Nakamura nodded and smiled. "Final payment on the house. My house. Twenty-three years of overtime, but I've done it. Just three more years until retirement, then my wife and I can finally—" He broke into a cough, waving off Xin's concerned look. "It's nothing. Just tired. Haven't slept more than four hours these past weeks."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMjY2ZWVkOTIyOTQ5OTZhYmUwNWE1MDNiY2M4MmYw"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"You should rest, Nakamura-san," Xin said, eyeing the Bloodtrooper supervisor stationed at the end of their row. "The quantum cores can process the fusion data without—"</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MmQ0MGZmMWI3NDQ4YmZhMjQ0MWUyNWY3ZDk0NTY2"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Can't stop now," Nakamura turned back to his display. "The Imperium rewards diligence, Wu-san. You'll understand when you're older. Ah, my retirement plan... just three more years..."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYmIzM2QxNGI1NTQ1MTY4NjRhZDc0OGNkYjIxZTBm"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">The older man's voice trailed off. His fingers froze over his keyboard. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhMWUyOGVmZDMyNjRkNjc5NWJjNTVkMTc2NzA5YWZj"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Nakamura-san?" For a moment, Xin thought he had simply dozed off – until Nakamura's head hit the desk with a dull thud. The glow of his final paycheck flashed on the screen.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NjI4MTFmMGFjYjQ2ZGI4MWUwNGMyY2IyOTgyOGQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin stood up, his chair clattering backward. "Someone help! Mister Nakamura here…he needs a doctor!"</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZDVmNTMzZDgzYzQ0ZDhhN2Q1YjM3ODdiODAxMDNj"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">But the surrounding engineers just stayed at their stations, looking between Xin and the approaching Bloodtroopers nervously.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYWZmMjY2MDcyYTQ5MTRhM2E4MTUxZDM2NTcxZjJk"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Sit down, citizen!" shouted the first trooper, his crimson armor reflecting the pulsing lights of the Zephyrium chambers. Spikes adorned his broad shoulderplates while his horned helmet concealed his expression.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMGUxZGE2MzVhOTRhZGE5N2NjZWZhOGRlY2Y4ZDc2"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"We should take him to the med bay!" Xin's voice rose. "He's been working sixteen-hour shifts for weeks without extra pay, without breaks—"</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDFmYTc1MDg4MjQ4ZjY4NmMwNzM4NzJjZGJkZDlh"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">The second trooper's armored hand clamped down on Xin's shoulder, forcing him back into seat. "The Imperium rewards diligence," he recited, his voice sounding deep inside his dark red horned helmet that resembled a demonic figure from ancient folklore. "And it punishes disobedience! Return to your work."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNjUxMjI3NDIxOTQ1NWRhOWE3ZDdmOGUwN2QwNDJk"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin watched as they dragged Nakamura away, the dead man's retirement papers still glowing on his display.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDFjZDY3OTBlYTRjODI4Mzg3ZDk0NTRmMWU1Y2Ux"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva"> Through his own screen, the rebel woman's tortured screams continued.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MjNmZmUxNThhMzQxYjZhYTRiNTQyY2I0YzgwNTQ0"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Not just the sound of Imperial justice, but a system that consumed its own people without mercy. A small price to pay for living in a society where few would starve. With the Universal Basic Income and the Employee Accountability System, poverty was nonexistent in this society — or so they were told.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MjkxNDFjMTYzNjQ0MmZiMjg4NDFjODFkNDRiM2I0"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">The neighboring engineers resumed typing. Every month or so, Dilinur would carry out one such methodical interrogation as his team worked on finding information about the legendary Moondust Crystal. Nothing in the Imperium's great machinery had changed at all.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMjQ2M2Y3ODdlMTRiZGZiZWQ1ZDFkOTRiZTY3YTFj"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">The interrogation feed cut out mid-scream. Xin's terminal flickered.</span></p><span class="cjc0OGFhZmUzYzJlMTQ4M2RhMzQzYjU3MjFjNWNjYzBh"><br/>If you discover this narrative on Amazon, be aware that it has been stolen. Please report the violation.<br/></span>
<p class="cnMyNWI3NjE4NmRhMDQ2MGJiMGQwZWUzOTM5ZmU4YjI2"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Wu Zhi-Xin," a contralto voice called from behind. Even without turning, he knew who it was.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMGM2ZGM0MTJmZjRmMWM5NjhlMDZlNjgzZTI2ZDNk"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur Altai stood by his desk, her presence commanding even more attention in person than through the surveillance feed. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzMDBjY2E5YzQ3ODRkYTI5MmUyMDRmYmY0Njg2ZjVj"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">At thirty-seven, she was a fine example of the Imperium's advanced cosmetic tech: her porcelain skin unmarked, maintained by treatments that cost more than most people earned in a year. Her features were striking: dark eyes like pearls, high cheekbones that could have been carved from white jade, and lips painted deep red like fresh blood. Her hair was gathered in an updo, secured by a hairpin bearing a blood-red gem that caught the light from the Helionite tubes overhead. A few loose strands framed her face.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MjQ4YTEwZGU4ODQ0NzRiZjZmY2I3MzBiY2JmMjdl"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Her traditional robe was immaculate. The black silk was embroidered with golden dragons, while the crimson inner layer revealed itself through openings that made her somewhat alluring. There were a few droplets of blood on her hairpin, evidence of the just-finished interrogation.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMDAzZWRlY2ZjMDQ0ZmNiZGVhZDQ0MTMzYmIwZjkw"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Prefect Altai," Xin said. Whatever beauty Dilinur possessed was best admired from a safe distance, if at all. "I assume you’ve obtained the info from the Sand Lotus agent?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NGRhN2ZiMzM5MzRkNDM5MmY4ODgwNTQ2ZGJlODU4"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Eventually." Dilinur's fingers traced his desk, coming to rest near his keyboard. "Though I'm more interested in what you've been doing. The Crystal's coordinates should have been processed by now."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNTQ4MmZlMGY5ODQwNDRhYmVlMWMzZjYwYjE2MGYw"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"I've been occupied with the fusion core data —"</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTM1NjNiMmM2MjQ1NzRhMmZiZDBiN2EwNzU3OTQ4"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"A task that could be handled by any miserable junior in this office," Dilinur cut him off. Her hand moved from the desk to his shoulder. "You're special, Xin. That's why ZenFusion gave you Ume, isn't it? Such a generous gift."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTJkMjVmOTMwMDQzMjhhNmQ5MTZiNWRhMWY3OTc2"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin's hands froze over his keyboard. The mention of Ume's name from Dilinur's lips sent ice through his veins.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MjkzMDgxNTk1YTQ3ZTRhOWZjY2ZmMzI0NDI2YmI5"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"She's waiting for you at home right now, yes?" Dilinur's grip tightened fractionally. "It would be a shame if she were...recalled. ZenFusion's generosity has limits, after all. Just ask your colleague Nakamura about corporate benefits." She smiled, the expression never reaching her dark brown eyes. "Oh wait."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTIwOTQ5ODRjNzRmZDNhNjc1OGE5NjZmYzM0ZWJi"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"W-what do you want?" Xin whispered.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDQyNzliMTQ5YzQxNDhhNDkxOWMyOWQ0OWEwMTBh"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Crystal's data. Compiled, encrypted, and stored in the level 117 cluster, with admin-level access for Governor Qin. You have twenty minutes." She leaned closer. "I'll be watching. Try anything clever, and Ume gets terminated."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNzM3N2E4N2Q3ZTQ3OGI5MzAxODA5MTQwOGE0MTY3"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Around them, the other engineers kept typing. None looked up as Dilinur straightened, adjusting her bloodstained hairpin.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNjFhODE3ODVmMjRmYWNhMDA3Yjg0NTg4MDVhNjgx"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Twenty minutes," she repeated. "Show me why ZenFusion considers you so valuable."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwM2QxMmQzNGM5ZjQyY2JhNGU5ODA1MjBhY2FkOGE4"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin's fingers flew across his haptic interface. The Zephyrium shard behind him pulsed faster, responding to the increased power draw as he initialized multiple quantum processors simultaneously. On his main display, a three-dimensional map of Osram began taking shape, its craters and valleys rendered in crystalline detail.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ODdlZDIzODQ2YjRkYWViMDNmYmQzNDU2YzRlMGNi"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Nineteen minutes," Dilinur announced, standing closer. "The encryptiond for level 117 are complex. I do hope you're not wasting time."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ODIwZGYyOTE3NjQ0M2FiMWUyYzUyMTg4ZDA0NDNm"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">He wasn't. The Sand Lotus rebel's interrogation had yielded coordinates, fragments of ancient maps, and cryptic references to lunar formations. Now those pieces floated around his display as he wove them into a cohesive dataset. Each fragment had to be verified, cross-referenced, and encoded with encryption.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYzdiNjU5NzBmMTQ5NmY4ZGYwNjAyZjUzNzkzY2Fm"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Thirteen minutes," Dilinur said again.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OGU4NmQzZmU5MjQ2MTBiMTU5MGMzZDc2MDcyNzAy"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin forced himself to breathe, to focus. The map was almost complete – a topographical of dark craters and unexplored regions. Somewhere in that lunar wilderness lay the Crystal.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZDI2ZTZjNzU1ZDRlMDg5YzBkNWQ0MTI1ZTUxNWEz"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">The Helionite tubes beneath the floor pulsed with a sickly green light as his systems processed the massive dataset. Other engineers had stopped typing as they watched him work.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZDEzY2FmZjhmZTRjZTA5ZDA3M2M2NDNiMDczNTc4"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Seven minutes," Dilinur whispered. Her hand came to rest on the back of his chair. "I'm curious, Xin. When you visit Ume tonight, will you tell her how close she came to deactivation? Or will you hold her in the dark, grateful that your skills proved... adequate?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDdlNmY4OTZlYzQ3MTE5ZGZhNzFmZTg4MzFkZTk1"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">The final pieces of data fell into place. The encryption protocols wrapped around the dataset. Xin initiated the transfer to level 117's secure cluster, watching the progress bar.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MzU4MzRmNTgzNzQyZDk4MTQxZDBhYzY5MjBjZDZm"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"And — transfer complete," he announced, his voice hoarse. "Stored on Cluster 6865. Encoded to Governor Qin's biosignature specifications, with an additional master key. You can verify—"</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDhmMzIwZDgzMDRlZjZhMTI4MWY5ZmIyM2M2YzMx"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Rest assured, I will." Dilinur's fingers traced up from his chair to his shoulder. "For Ume's sake, I hope your work is perfect."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNTE4OWUxYmZiYTQyMmY5YzQ0OGQ2YWQ2OTdmMWZi"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">The quantum displays dimmed as the system processed his massive data transfer.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNjQ1YTc3YzExYjRiMzY4MzFkOTA0ZmE4YjgxYWI4"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur leaned closer, her finger tracing along a section of code on his display. "This sequence here," she said as her ebony fingernail paused above a function. "It seems redundant. Explain."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMDQ2NWYxN2YxOTRjMmRiM2U4N2I4YmU4YzFiNDk5"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin's heart skipped. She'd found the foundation of his backdoor – the fragment that would later allow him to access what should be inaccessible. He recalled the days when they had both studied Information Management at Taipei Imperial Institute, back when Dilinur was not a cruel, heartless Prefect but 'Dinu the Flower of Class C'.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNmNlMWZkM2EwNzQ4MjFhZjA2YWM1NDc1NTIzYzY5"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva"> She had selected virtually the same courses as Xin, not because they thought alike, but because she was too busy attending after-class social parties, cultivating connections with authorities. He would always lend her his assignments to ensure they both passed with straight A grades. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiZmY1NDI0ZTEyMzRkNzk4M2U4YmI1OTk3ZjA1MGEz"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">In return, Dilinur would pretend to be his girlfriend during Imperial Population Management inspections, shielding him from the mandatory social integration evaluations that had sent so many "abnormally introverted" citizens to reeducation facilities.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NTk3YjE4MDViNTQ1YzliMDNhYTdlYzgzYjE4MGY3"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">He wondered if Dilinur still remembered that chapter of their lives.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTEzNjc0MzJhNzRlYjk4YzgwMTlmMTdhYzJhNWNk"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">But now was not the time for things that could never be. His mind raced, assembling a technical lie that would satisfy her. She didn't need to understand. She only needed to believe that she did.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDdkYWNiNTViYTRhZTRiYTY0MjJhNjgxYThmM2Y3"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Pattern regeneration protocol," he answered, trying to sound calm. "If someone attempts to hack or corrupt the Crystal's data from outside, this segment creates dynamic replacement matrices that preserve the original structure." He gestured to the code.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOWIwNDAwODQxMTQzNTBiYmU3YjQ1YTU3ZWJiZGE5"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">The lie tasted bitter in his mouth. If there was one thing Xin despised more than the Imperium's casual cruelty, it was dishonesty. As a child, he'd once refused to speak for three days after his mother lied about their family history to an Imperial census taker. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5NmQ1MjExY2VhNTQ1YjFhNWI2MTRiYmIxODI4OGM0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><span style="font-weight: 400">Even now, he could recite the lesson his grandfather had whispered when they were alone: "</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Truth is the only wealth that cannot be stolen from you.</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">"</span></span></p>
<p class="cnNiNjFkZjhlZTMwMjRlMTdiMGNhMWM4Njg4MzIyN2Zk"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Yet here he was, spinning falsehoods with ease. The irony wasn't lost on him: he was lying to protect his chance to finally reveal a truth.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTYyMTYxMDhmZTQxNDE5YTc5Y2U2NzJmMjliYWMy"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur studied him for a moment. Then she nodded once, seemingly satisfied. "Acceptable work. I’ll test the master key later this week."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhODAxZDY2YzM2YjQ1ODc4MTM2Yzc0OWM3Y2RhOWMy"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">She turned to leave, then paused. "Remember to document the interrogation footage. The Imperium's records must be thorough."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Nzc4MTFhMmYwNzQ3OTFiZjgwOWJiNmY0ZGQ0MWVi"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">The click of her heels faded into the hum of fusion cores. Around him, the other engineers gradually resumed their work.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZWQxMDViMTAwNTRlZTc4ZjMzYjY0MzIwNTBhNjc1"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin let out a sigh of relief as his hands moved mechanically over his keyboard, transcribing the torture he'd witnessed. But as he typed, his fingers created something else: a hidden subroutine. A backdoor into the very data he'd just encrypted.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YmY3YmFhZTRlMjRhNzhiYzU1ZDk4MDc5MDQxNGNj"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">His heart pounded with each keystroke, knowing discovery would mean worse than death. It would mean losing Ume.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZjJiMDdiMTI4NDRjOTE5NWI1NjNiZDI3NmFjOWRk"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">He glanced at Nakamura's empty workstation, the retirement papers still glowing on the display. The tubes of Helionite beneath his feet pulsed their sickly green light, carrying away the waste of progress, feeding the very monsters they feared.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYmZlODM0MjBkOTQ3OTI5YWFkMTQ2Y2MxMGNmZWFk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As the transfer completed, Xin allowed himself a moment of satisfaction. The Moondust Crystal—whatever it truly was—represented power beyond imagination. The Imperium wanted it. The Terra Alliance would kill for it.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNTYzODM4ZjQyNzQxOGY5NjQ0YjJhODY1ZDlkZGQ1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin rubbed his exhausted eyes, another eighteen-hour shift blurring his vision. He glanced at the window, and there it was again – that pull toward the moon. The feeling that somewhere, others were looking up at the same silver disc, feeling the same inexplicable connection.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYWQxZmVjNDZiZTRiOTZhOGVhZDk1N2I1Y2VjMjBh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">His workstation chimed. The code was still there. And the weird feeling lingered.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOTkwZWMyYjY0ZTRmMDhiZjNhZDBkNmUxZDk3ZDQy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Hey, did you watch the news? There's another Radi-Mon attack in the Americas. Chicago this time." A colleague nearby whispered as he looked around nervously, making sure there were no guards nearby.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOWFiOWIyMzU4MTQ3NGZhZmVjMWEyMzQxY2IzN2Rl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Those Alliance pigs deserve it. I bet the Radi-Mons attacked because of some illegally dumped Helionite." Another replied dismissively.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjM2EwMjhhMzVjYzRhYTZhY2M4MjVhZWE3OWZkZTQw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"But don't we have dump sites on the island's east, too? And there's the sewage under the city..."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMzkzYzUxNzNhZDQ5YjI5MDk0Y2ZmMDBlMmZjM2Jk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Shh! You want the Bloodtroopers to hear us? Shut up!"</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YWY1NTc4NWM1YTQxZWViMWZkNWZhZTdlMzZiNWNj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Just do your work, Chen. Everything will be fine." A third co-worker chimed in carefully.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MzEzZThiZGFjYjQ5ZjI5NjBhMGNjZWY3OGMwZGMw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin listened quietly, wondering if the world was ready for what would happen when someone finally claimed it.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZWQ5ZDM0ZDhhYzQ5YTM4NzdkODY1NzI1YmM3YjA4"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">A message flashed on his display: ‘SHIFT COMPLETE - 23:30’.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZGNmMTA1ZjZhZTQwNzliZmQ5Y2Q1MzAxYTI5OWZl"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin shut down his terminal, pocketing a dark green quantum drive so small it barely made a bulge. Standing made his head spin – how long had it been since he'd eaten? Slept? The dates blurred together.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZjk2NTY2NDVlMDQ4Y2JhNWMzMjk0YjQyNzBlMGZi"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Goodnight, Wu-san," one of his colleagues murmured as he passed. They all understood. In the Imperium, survival meant keeping your head down, your opinions silent, your conscience blind.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZDExNDM5MzA4YjQ2OWE5NGY2OTY4ZjY5ZDIwYTgw"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">But as Xin walked toward a Quantum Lift at the end of the hallway, past the bloodstains where they'd dragged Nakamura away, he felt something within him: The Imperium's machinery would never stop on its own.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxM2QxMDY2Y2NmZTQ2MDRiMDBhNjIyZjM5ZDQ3MTcx"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Someone would have to break it.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZGQwOTg5NjI2MTQ5ODg4YWYwMjk0NDc5NjNjNzYw"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">The elevator’s doors closed on the 87th floor of the Amber Moon Spire, carrying him down toward home, toward Ume. Behind him, the interrogation room waited for its next victim, while somewhere on Osram, a Crystal held secrets worth dying – or killing – for.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZWY1ODhhODYxNDQ0MmY4MmQzZTEyZDk1MDkzZTlm"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Wait for me, Ume," he whispered, invoking the name like a talisman.</span></p>
