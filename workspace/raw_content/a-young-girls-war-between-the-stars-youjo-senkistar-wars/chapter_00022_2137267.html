<p class="cnM1OTNiNTc0OTgyNzQ0NTA4NTIwMjdkN2M5NzVjMmI4" style="margin-bottom: 0">I had <em>hoped</em><span style="font-style: normal"> that Satine was wrong, but the longer things went on, the more it looked like I would have to concede that perhaps she had a point. Obi grew steadily more sulky and</span><em> pouty </em><span style="font-style: normal">by the day, </span><span style="font-style: normal">and oddly of two minds at night. When she was awake, she huddled on the opposite end of the bed and proceeded to ignore me. The moment she fell asleep however, I became a human dakimakura again. </span><span style="font-style: normal">The problem with that was, even in her sleep Obi was sulky.</span></p>

Cracking an eye open, I poked and prodded the older girl until she woke with a confused sound, radiating annoyance. Realizing she was wrapped around me, she started to let go and turn away as </span><em>more </em><span style="font-style: normal">annoyance filled her.</span></p>

<p class="cnMyMTExZmNlN2I2ODQyOTY4MjgwNGZmMDAzMjgyYjk5" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">Obi stopped trying to both push me away and untangle herself so she could roll away. She studied me carefully for several moments before her sulking and pouting stopped and she grew happy. Pulling me back into a hug, she wrapped herself back around me and settled back in without a word. Within minutes, she was out like a light—this time, dreaming happy dreams apparently.</p>

<p class="cnM1YTE4ODU5ZWQ5NjQwODk4OGRjYmM3OTFjOTcxMDk5" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">“Our departure, of course,” she answered, as though the answer were obvious. “I’m going with you. My people are going. If we can find a means to negotiate peacefully, then I don’t have to endanger them. And failing that, if negotiations break down… I would like to take this opportunity to gain some much needed real world experience. It isn’t often that Mandalorians and Jedi work together. Between our two groups, this is perhaps the safest I will ever be and I would hate to miss what may be a once in a lifetime chance while I had it.”</p>

<p class="cnNmNzc3MTAyZWQxZjQ5NTU5OTMzZmI3YWU3ODVjZjFh" style="margin-bottom: 0">The Masters all exchanged looks, before eventually, Master Dooku nodded. Master Dooku shifted a look towards Jaster, “If Mandalore Mereel will agree to provide an extra security detail.”</p>
<p class="cnNjNWMxZDYzN2M4NjQ0NjI5ZTc4MjcyNzEzMjZkZDU4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM0NzA4ZTRhMmM3OTRlYWY5OWMyZTQwZmY1N2U4ZDIy" style="margin-bottom: 0">Jaster nodded in agreement. “We’ll get it done. Once we get there, I’ll join them and we’ll go with you while my men get into position. I’d like to keep our presence hidden until it’s time to strike. Make contact, attempt negotiations first, then when those break down we’ll start hitting them where it hurts.”</p>
<p class="cnMxYjZkNjVhNjFkYzRkMjhhZmFlYzdjMmMzNGFkNTQx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM1ZTAyMDhjOGFmNjRiNWI5Zjg2Mjk0YzUzNmUyZDJk" style="margin-bottom: 0">Master Dyas nodded. “In a little over a day and a half, we’ll reach Serenno. Just in case the planet has been blockaded, we should drop out of hyperspace early, on the far edge of the system. Do we have a map?”</p>
<p class="cnNlMmU4Y2JlMDJkYjQwOWJhYmI0YmQ4ZDUwZTI5MWM3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM3ZjJkYTkzZWE3YTQ2NWZiNDE4NzE5OGFlNWY2YTZh" style="margin-bottom: 0">I held out a hand and spun up an illusion formula, projecting the system map I’d memorized. The Serenno System contained only five planets. From closest to their star outwards, there was a planet nearly in the same distance to it as I recalled Venus was from Sol. In the second orbit was Serenno itself, sitting right in the Goldilocks zone. Technically in the third orbit was an asteroid belt, sitting between Serenno and the third planet. Their third planet was rocky and just a bit bigger than Serenno, sitting right on the outer edge of the habitable zone. Their fourth and fifth planets were both big gas giants comparable to Jupiter and serving largely the same purpose—that of a sweeper, keeping out rogue asteroids.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZWE5N2NmYTk2MzQwOTI4ZWJmZGYyNWRkMTgxMDY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMwNzNmNjYwN2RlNDRhMTlhN2VkNGI1OTlmMjU0ZWU1" style="margin-bottom: 0">Master Dyas nodded and pointed to the ring of planets circling the Serenno System’s star. “We will drop out here, in the shadow of the third planet. With the asteroid belt between us and the inner system, it’s unlikely we’ll be spotted. I suggest our Mandalorian friends come out on the opposite side of the system, here,” he tapped at the map and I helpfully provided a red dot. “From there, we can assess the situation and make a decision, but we should put together our plans for handling any potential blockade now. Remember, we’re dealing with Abyssin mercenaries, but we believe that someone on the planet is giving them orders.”</p>
<p class="cnMwOTg5NmUxN2MyMjQzZmNhMzU2ZTM3ZjhhOWI0OTZh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNiYWRiMGZkNTNjMTRhOTFiMWNjYmI3NzkyOGMzZGM2" style="margin-bottom: 0">Master Qui-Gon nodded. “If there’s no blockade and they have moved fully over to ground warfare, then we can simply move in closer and have our diplomatic team come down outside the capital while our main forces muster nearby, under cover. Perform reconnaissance on the city, then reconvene and plan our next move.”</p>
<p class="cnMwYjE1NDE4MTFjNzQ4ODU5NDlkNTE5N2ZkMjM1MTAz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM0YjNkNGQxMDI5ODQxY2U5OTlhN2UxNGUwYWU4ZmU3" style="margin-bottom: 0">“If they’re at all competent, they’ll have at least a small force blockading the planet at the standard hyperspace exit and in-system patrols looking for trouble,” Jaster pointed out.</p>
<p class="cnM1NDAxMDdjZTI2ZDRkZWE4MzFiNDQ1NjIzNTM5ZjNk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM1MTlhNjVkNzkzNDQ5ZGRhNWUyYjgyNDMwZmVhYjVl" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Then if it’s a light blockade, we should be able to slip our forces in on the opposite side of the planet, depending on their formation,” Master Qui-Gon continued. “The question is, should we attempt to negotiate with the blockading force and ask them to vacate the area?”</p>
<p class="cnM5ZDQzMzhmMGY3MzRiZmRhNjMxNzI4MDU1ZTA3YjVl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNmYTE5N2I1MTQ0YTRjY2U4OTkzNTFhNWRhNTM5MzI3" style="margin-bottom: 0">Jaster shook his head. “Abyssin mercs have no honor. You could probably bribe them. On the other hand, anyone who uses them knows it, so they’ll have paid them well in advance to keep them from just taking more money and fucking off. Best to just assume they’re hostile and are going to light us up if we approach. If there’s few enough of them, we could take their blockade out and move down to the planet. Otherwise, best to maneuver and slip on by.”</p>
<p class="cnNkZGU1OTczNWFhNTQ1YmVhMzc1ZjdmNzIwNGUxZWMy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMwYjkzYzJkYTFhYTQxMDlhMTJkZmE5ZDdiZmE0ZTNm" style="margin-bottom: 0">Dooku hummed. “I don’t like the idea of leaving a foe with the high ground. A small strike force to remove them would be ideal, if they aren’t present in large numbers. However, the moment they’re detected, or failing that as soon as the blockade fails to check in, the enemies on the ground will be alerted to our presence. We should prepare accordingly.”</p>
<p class="cnMzYjVjMmQyZmIyNDRiYzRiZjhjNmM4ZTgwZjQ4ODNi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNjYzVlZWY0NTk3MTRmYjI4YWViMWE0ZDUzNWFkZDU1" style="margin-bottom: 0">“What if the blockade is too large to deal with?” Satine asked, drawing their attention to her. “I assume we won’t have the ability to field a navy’s worth of starfighters to deal with a large blockade. Our people simply don’t have them and I doubt the Jedi have been hiding a fleet of starfighters up the sleeves of their robes. So, what then?”</p>
<p class="cnMyNDBkZWFmZmMzZTQ1MmRhOTU5NzM2NjQ5ZWVjMWUx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNkZWUwYzNhOWUxMDQzYjlhOWU5NzAzZGMxMGY2OTM0" style="margin-bottom: 0">“A series of smaller insertions, one or two ships at a time, in between patrol and visibility windows,” Jaster answered immediately. “Once we’re in atmosphere, dive for the deck. Stay low and find somewhere to set down. We’ll be moving either by small craft, jetpack, speeders, or on foot from there. Move in, secure the ground defenses, then shoot the blockade out of the sky.”</p>
<p class="cnMwNWIxZTQxMmRmYzQwNmM5N2VkODAyNjIzN2JjOWRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMxYzRiMjllM2VhYjQ3YmI5ODY2ODhlMjVhYTE3YjVk" style="margin-bottom: 0">Looking over the group and seeing that we all seemed to be following along and no one objected, Master Dooku picked up from there. “Master Sifo-Dyas will accompany the bulk of the Mandalorian forces, with Tanya.” Shifting his gaze to me, the old man smiled. “Follow Master Dyas’s instructions, but use your best judgment as the situation calls for it.”</p>
<p class="cnNmYTk5YWIxMTdkMzRjNzI5NGRjMjA4ZTM2MGI3ZGEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNiZjMzZWFkNDAzMzQzMTg5ODQ1NTliNGVlMzM2NzVk" style="margin-bottom: 0"><em>In other words, follow orders, but I’m free to improvise,</em><span style="font-style: normal"> I translated. I nodded, confirming I understood.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OGY1YjFmZmNjMTRhMjhiMGVlOTJiMjczYzQ2MjY4" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNkZGVmMTFkMzU4NzRjOWZhNThkZjU1MWVkNmMyOTNj" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<span style="font-style: normal">One more thing,” Master Dyas added, grinning. “I received a holo-com last night. Master Lene will be joining us.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NjA5MmQzMDk5ODQyNjdiMTY0Y2ExYzdhMDA5YjU5" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMyYjllODIzY2JiZDQwOWI5N2RjZGQzYzBiNThjODA4" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">“Oh?” Dooku raised an eyebrow. “It has been some time since I’ve seen her. What convinced her to come out to Serenno?”</p>
<p class="cnMzMDRlNDM4Yjg2OTQ1YTlhM2EwZWRhMjgxMGE2NjRk" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNlMjYyMGUxNmFmMTRjZTlhYzg5ZWY2MzY1NzViMGY1" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<span style="font-style: normal">She wants to help.” At Master Dooku’s expectant look, Master Dyas chuckled and held his hands up in surrender. “And the usual hunting for Sith artifacts.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNzRlYTMyMzYwODQ3NTc5N2Y3OGM0Nzc4YTkxZTY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM5MWJlNmIzNmI5ZjQyOGFiNzBhMDhkYjM2YTlhMDVm" style="margin-bottom: 0">While they were speaking and I was listening with half an ear, Jaster had turned to Jango and given his own instructions. “You’re in charge of the force. I’ll call in orders if I want something specific done, but once we go hot, you’re free to assign missions as you see the need. Cause as much hell as you can.” Nodding at me, he grinned, “Don’t hesitate to put her to work.”</p>
<p class="cnM5ZmZhNzI4ODY2ZDQzMTNiNTQwMzE1MDVhM2QyMGRk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMyMGVhNDlhNmYzNzQwZjNhMGI1M2UyYWNhNTAyMjY3" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Latrine duty, yes sir,” Jango chuckled.</p>

<p class="cnNmYzJjYjYyMTM4OTQyZWU4ZTQyYTkyOWViN2ZjNmYx" style="margin-bottom: 0">I turned my sweetest smile up at the man, thinking on the last time I got to use a short-handled shovel… “I assume you’ll be issuing me a trench shovel?”</p>

<p class="cnNjOWQwZTg2ZjA2NzRiNTliMGU3ZjJmNzk4MjljZmIw" style="margin-bottom: 0">Something about my words or tone made him flinch for some reason. I took that as a win.</p>

<p class="cnM0ZWRiMmIxMzc4OTRlZWRiNzlkZjE1ZGE1YWYxYmE3" style="margin-bottom: 0">After some last checks, we were soon on our way to our ships. I found myself pulled aside and into a hug by Obi. The taller girl pressed her face into my hair and inhaled, before letting it out in a sigh. “You going out on your own makes me nervous. Something always happens when you do.”</p>

I reached out with the Force for a quick scan just to be sure and avoid any potential Death Watch traps if someone got cute, but upon finding nothing, I ran the preflight sequence. Soon enough, I was lifting into the air and leaving Sundari’s dock, following behind the other two Jedi ships as the Mandalorian ships lifted off from the surface and joined us.</span></p>

Some experiments and minor modifications to the existing hardware had netted some decent percentages of increase in range, power, and penetration. Replacing the focusing crystals with kyber crystals from my chunk of crystal had increased it further, but the shots now came out the distinctive white-silver of my blade—so when, not if, I had to fire one of them the bolts would stand out in the crowd in a bad way. The gains were worth it, however, so I left the new crystals in.</p>

No, most of the improvements had been in making it livable, turning it from a military vessel meant to house a small crew in cramped, uncomfortable quarters for a prolonged period into something more closely resembling a civilian vessel on the inside.</span></p>

I’d have to test how viable that was, first. When sealed up, it would look like your standard, run of the mill pilot or plug suit.

Then, I tossed the clothes and boots into the locker. Grabbing the collapsible helmet, I clipped it to the side of my belt and hurried for the back of the ship, where I kept my weapons locker and some of my gear—and all of my explosives.</p>

I got up and took a few moments to use the restroom—thankfully, the suit had been designed with that in mind and had a seam to remove the bottom like pants, which sealed up again when I put them back together. I finished up, washed my hands, and hastily ate a protein bar and drank my fill of water before putting it away. Then, I went through and triple checked that everything was secured on the ship.</span></p>

<p class="cnNiYWZmZTIzYzY4ZDQwMWI5ZDU5ZDlmN2E2ZTM3NWE2" style="margin-bottom: 0">The ten minute warning off and I made my way to the hatch. I pulled the helmet off my belt and snapped it open, then secured it over my head. The controls on the inside of my wrist pressurized the suit and checked its integrity, and only after confirming that it was green across the board did I press the buttons beside the hatch to depressurize the ship. Without an airlock, the entire ship had to depressurize, sucking its atmosphere back into the environmental system. It only took a minute, and then I was good to open the hatch. Another button shut off the internal artificial gravity, so I wouldn’t go from an area of artificial gravity to zero gravity.</p>

I hung there, suspended maybe half an inch off the floor, as I hit the hatch release. The hatch opened and I eased outside under the very minute direction of a flight formula and sealed the hatch again before I changed my mind.</p>

<p class="cnM0NzBmY2M1ZjQzODQ0MDI5MjRmNzM3ZTZlMGIxZTk4" style="margin-bottom: 0">I hurried across the pitted, barren landscape of my small patch of solid ground and stopped at the spot I’d calculated I’d need to launch from when the asteroid’s tumble brought it in line with the carrier. I came to a stop and looked up, the suit’s onboard computer highlighting the path I’d already programmed in and providing a countdown for when I needed to jump.</p>

My mouth was suddenly dry. My heart hammered in my chest. My stomach roiled, I tasted acid in the back of my throat, and I kind of regretted eating. My body broke out in a cold sweat and my muscles trembled.</p>
