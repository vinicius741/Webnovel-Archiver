<p align="left" class="cnM0MjViYWNjYzg5NDRlYTQ4MzE4OGZlMzUwNTcyNWFl">The small crunching of snow kept echoing behind Emma as she walked. Her sword turned staff produced a glow each time. Emma sighed and shook her head at Karlack.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM5ZWI1OTk3MGZiMTRhZDBiMDliMzU0NWVhNmQ2ZGUy">“It wasn’t my fault to begin with, so what do you want me to do about it?” Emma asked, receiving a sharp pain in her sternum in response. “Okay! Fine!”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM5MGRjNWNiYjYyYjRiYzQ4YTAyNDQzZmIyNmM3OTc0">Emma finally turned around to the crunching of snow behind her and spotted a small head poking out from behind a tree. The instant the girl was spotted, she quickly hid her entire small frame behind the trunk.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNjMmU4MTNhYjUxNzQ4ZTE5ZWRhZDY3MWYyZGQzYWUz">“Hey! I know you’ve been following me, so just come out already!”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNjNGZiYjU1YmQ5YjRmMjJhMmFkZTYzYzZmZDhjNDQy">The little girl flinched and slowly moved her body into the light. She put her hands up defensively and spoke in a small quivering voice. “You’re not going to eat me, are you?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMzOTJlYTY2NWU2MjRkMDNiYjNkOTIzMGY0NGJkNmFi">Emma moved closer to the girl and sighed. “First of all, I need to know why you’ve been following me.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMyNmU4NjMzZDliODQwZTNiODBjMTliMzAxMjRhY2Rj">Sora shook her head, her shoulder-length brown hair flailing about with the motion.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM4MjA1NjRlYjZmZjQ5ZGU5NGJlMDBjNGQ3YmYxMmE1">“Well, if you don’t answer me, I might consider eating you.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMxNjU2ODk1ZjdlZTQ5Yjc5MmE5NzU0ZWNiNWQ2MmJi">“No! You can’t!”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNmMTY2NjI3ZjQyYzRiMTNiNTM0ODZkMjNkMjVhNzY3">Emma chuckled at the distraught little girl. “So what’ll it be? Either you tell me why you’ve been following me, or you become my next meal.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMwOGViOTI3OWIxMTQ5NTFiZmE4N2Y0ZmQ1YzI2YWYy">Sora shivered as she looked up at Emma’s sharp white fangs. The little girl’s eyes became cloudy with tears. “Please don’t eat me!”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM1ZmY0MDY3MTcyYjQxZWM5YzkyZGE5ZGY3NDA4MDlj">Emma felt another sharp prick of pain coming from her staff. “Alright, alright! Geez, I wasn’t going to eat you anyway.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMxN2FkNWJhMjNlMzQ3Njc4NWVjN2VkZTBmZDZkYmEw">The little girl sniffled and wiped away her tears. “You weren’t?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNjNTA5NmU2OWZhYzQ2YWRhZTNiYWZiYmYwZGFkNTMz">“No, and why should that be a surprise?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM3ZGQ4NmY2MjE1ZjRiNjY4N2NhOWU1Y2ZhYTFhMzE5">“B-but, at the village you said…”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM2NDk0OWMyZTE2NDQ4MWJiYTg4ZWUzOWUxOTlkYjdm">“Bleh, bleh, bleh, who cares what I said before. That was then, and this is now. Though, I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t hungry…” Emma resisted looking at Sora’s wide eyes as the little girl giggled.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM4YThjZmZhNWYzODQ0OTk5MjBkN2EwZjE5OTNjZDMy">“I knew you weren’t a monster!” Sora yelled. The little girl excitedly jumped and wrapped her small arms around the vampire.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNjOWUyN2YxY2QyYjRjYzQ4MzdiYmJmODAzMmNjM2E5">“No, no, you’re definitely wrong, little girl. I am a very evil monster who feeds on the blood of innocents.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM3ZmM3ODgxMDMxMTRjNzliOWMyMjhjNDJhYzc0NGUx">Sora shook her head and buried it into Emma’s snowy outfit. “You’re not a monster. You’re just a little cold.” The little girl pouted as she continued. “Also, I’m not a little girl! I am Sora!”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM4YzYwMDU1NjRiNDRmYjc5ZWViMTFlMGI4MzllYjcy">“Right, Sora, so why are you following me?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNhMTY1YjljZWVkYjRhNTE5NjNhMjUxYzlhNWJlNjQz">“Nu-uh, that’s not fair! You didn’t give me your name!”</p><span class="cjg4OTQ3OGMxMTE4ZjQ5MzZhNTBiOWNmNjI2ZjcxZWVl"><br/>The story has been illicitly taken; should you find it on Amazon, report the infringement.<br/></span>
<p align="left" class="cnNhMmQzNGJkOGI3MzRjZjFiMDJkMjI4OTdhNjQzZThm">The vampire sighed and nudged the little girl off of her. “I’m Emma,” she said before gesturing towards her staff, “and this is Karlack.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNiY2RkMTcxNDc1MjRmYzBiNTkzZDlkNmYxMzU4ZmI2">“Emma! I like that name!”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNhZDU5NTYwODQxOTQzNjRiYzhhOTcwNGM0ZmQ1ZmJl">The Emma in question scratched her cheek awkwardly. “Listen, little girl...”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNiYjUzZmQxNDQzYTRjMGU5NjA4ZmY5ZDRmMjUxNTBh">“Sora!”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM0YTRkZGFhYTUyODRjZTY5ZDE5YmVjYzQxMTQ3MmVh">“Listen, Sora...you can’t just run after random strangers you don’t know. Especially if those strangers happen to be an evil vampire.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMxY2M1ZTVjMThhMjQ2OGZhMmQ0MjdhOTk1MmQ5MDU0">“Vampire? Is that what you are?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM1ZGM0ZWM5ODk0ZjQ3MmU5MjQ4ODI2NTEwMjI5MmUw">“Yeah, how’d you not know that? You’re far too naive for your own benefit.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNjY2NjYjI0YjkwYTQxZDU4YjIwODA4NDExM2E3MTYz">“I am not! Mother already told me! Strangers are dangerous.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMzODkzM2Y1NDNhYTRmNTliNTRkZDQ0YTMzMGM2Zjdl">Emma sighed and poked the girl’s forehead. “And how do you explain this situation, then? How old are you, little girl?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMzZDQ1NjlkNWFjNjRkNDg4OTZlMDJiMjNhZmU3OTc5">“I’m ten! And you’re not a stranger!”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMwZmI3NzY4ODU5ZTQ1ZjNiZjVhMmQ3OTAxZjhkNzZm">“I am a stranger. Before this interaction, you didn’t even know my name.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMzNGY2ZTVlNDI5ODRlYzk5NDM0ZGVkYzYxMWU5OGE3">“Well, now I know your name, so now we aren’t strangers.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM2YmFiNWE3MTczMjQ0OTg4NjJhNThlMGNiMTNmYWNj">Emma felt a headache coming along from trying to reason with a child. “You still haven’t told me why you are following me. How did you even manage to find my trail afterwards? I’m surprised you didn’t freeze to death.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM1MGRmOThkZjI4ZjRmZTI4NDg3ZWNkMjlhMzEyMGFm">“I started trying to find you because I wanted to thank you! The elders didn’t want me to leave, so I had to sneak out. Then I found you by following the river!”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM0ZThjZGI3ZTgzZDQwY2U5OGE3YWJiYjRjYTQyZjRl">“You followed the river? Why?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMwNTI3OWFjN2QzZTQ4MDk4ZTRiNjZhYjJjMDA1ZWMw">“I figured that even monsters would need to get water.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMyMjgyMjA2ZDBiMDRlMzI4NjVjNGQzMGFlNzc5MDMx">“Hey! I thought you said I’m not a monster!”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNhODUwMmIzOGVlYTQ0Nzc4NjRmODdmNTMxNjE3MDVi">Sora giggled. “That was then, and this is now.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNiNDAwYTZlN2IyYzQwMjBhZmMzNzZhODhmMTk1ODk1">“You little…”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNlZGRhZmZmNjg5MzQ2OGZiOGRiNmIyMDFlMTliMzM4">“It’s Sora!”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMyMzE5MzMxZDliZjQxNjA4YmQxZDQzOTFjNzRjNTY4">“Alright, fine. Sora? You can give your thanks and be on your way now. I’m sure those people will be worried about you.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMyYTc3ODAwNDc5NTQwN2NiYTNiNDcyNWQyMjZkY2Zh">The little girl shook her head. “I want to follow you!”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNkODliZWI3MjliZTQ4ZjVhMDFiMWM1ZWZhMjQ2YTE5">“Nope. No, no, no!”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM0NWY2ZjViZjBmZTQ0ZGQ5YzZhMzE0OTMzY2IxNDJi">“Why not? You’re all alone, aren’t you?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNhNzEzYWRiOGIxNTQ4ZTI4YWYyNjBjZmM5MzQ0MmI2">“I am not alone! I said it before. Didn’t I introduce you? This is Karlack.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM5Y2JjZmQ0NjU4YTQ2NjI5MTVmM2Q0NzliYjQ4ZjA5">Sora tilted her head at the staff and poked it. After receiving no response she looked at Emma with pity.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNhOGYzMGE3ZGQzZDQ3ZTk4MmNlNjczMjE1ZTI1MWUy">“Wait,” Emma said, “it’s really sentient. Go ahead, show her what you can do, Karlack!”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMxNDQ2ODJmYjg1ZjQyMDM4OWE4MjRkZjgyMzUwNzUz">The expected response of a glow never came, nor was there any pain to accompany her query. The only thing that responded was the wind giving a faint whistle in the background.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMwNjFiM2JmYmYwNTRjZjJiNGFmNzY2NDYxMDZlNzFj">“Oh no! You’re not doing this!” Emma grabbed the staff with her other hand securely before putting a bit of force into it. “If you keep ignoring me, I will snap you in half!”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNlYjE2NjFiZDMyMjRjODY4MWE0N2FjOTUxZGI2Zjc1">A blue glow finally responded, and a searing pain attacked Emma’s chest. She could hear the snapping of bones before they wriggled around and stitched themselves together.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNhYWU0ODU5ZWIwOTRjNTJhNzVkMWQyZDAxNzVlODQz">Emma winced from the pain before smiling smugly at Sora. “See, I told you this thing was sentient.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNiYTI5ZDg3Zjk5YjQyZTBiOTM0Y2E4OTEyYmEyMDM1">Sora stared at the vampire with wide eyes. “W-well, that might be true, but…”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM4ODlmN2I2OTdlYjRjMTk4ZjhhOWU3NjdjMWY3ZjE3">“No buts...Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a certain mission to get back to…”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNhMGYyOTkwZjc3NTQ1NzhhZjYwYzU4OWU1YjU4YWU4">“What mission is that? Do you even know where you’re going?” Sora managed to stop the vampire in her tracks.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM1YTk4YWFmZDlkOTRkZjM4YmU5NWJkZjdhMmVmNjFl">Emma whipped around with a frown. “That’s classified information, unfit for children to know.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNlZGM3ZGRhYWViMjRkYmU5ZjliNjJhODFlNjJlNzY5">Sora pouted and grabbed onto Emma’s arm. “I’m not a child! And what’s classified?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM3YzU5NTExZTBkMDQ1NDA5MmI2NTg3MzAzYWE4ZWQz">“How can you call yourself an adult if you don’t even know what that word means?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNiZjZiNTMyMDk5ZjQwZjU5MThlOGNhODc0NTNhMDk3">“Mother never said that word even once! You’re lying!”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM3NDcyOGRmMzVmNDRiYTViOGI4YThhMWUyNWM1YWFl">Emma bent down so her head was even with Sora’s. The vampire ground her teeth together in frustration. “So what if it’s a lie? I’m a monster, and you’re a child. You should be at home with those villagers.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM5NDJhODIyNDJmMjQzOGI4YmNmMGE2NjVhYzgzOTM4">“I don’t even have a home to go back to!”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM5NmM5Y2IyMWE3MTQ1YThhNmFjN2YxNzJjNTU2Y2Mx">Emma recoiled from the change in emotions. She wasn’t sure if the sharp pain in her chest was coming from her weapon, or if it was a twinge of guilt from not being able to make it in time. The only sound she could produce was a faint groan that was more like a whimper.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNhNDc1MzE1NDMzZjRjMzliZmUwNDM1YzUzNTM3NTA5">“And your father?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNjMDRlODY0ZTNkMTRiZjI4NDE4MmFjZjg5NDNkYjM4">Sora shook her head.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNhNTRhYmE3NWVjYzQ2OWNhNTM4NDc5Mjg4MTk0YTQ2">Emma sighed and tapped the little girl on the shoulder. “Fine, stop crying! You can accompany me to the next city...Wherever that may be, and then I will promptly dump you off at the first orphanage.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNkZGU4ZjBlMWE0MjRlMmQ4OWY4MjAxYzg2MTRkMjIx">The little girl smiled through teary eyes and wrapped her arms around the monster. “You’re so cruel.”</p>
