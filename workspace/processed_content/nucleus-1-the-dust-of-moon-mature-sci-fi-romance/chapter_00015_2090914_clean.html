   lmost there," Jabari Adomako piloted his Scarab mech through the streets of Abidjan, the cockpit filled with blinking lights.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The city sprawled beneath him — a mix of lights and shadows. Skyscrapers rose high above, their neon signs pulsing with the rhythm of the midnight economy.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari's Scarab moved with precision, its six legs finding grip on the urban terrain. From his cockpit, Jabari had a good view of his surroundings. Pedestrians looked small from his elevated position.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   At the intersection of Independence Boulevard and Houphouët Avenue, the traffic control system brought him to a halt — even military mechs had to respect civilian infrastructure.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Moving one to the control panel, Jabari flicked on the radio, the cockpit filling with the late-night broadcast of Radio Côte d'Ivoire. Static crackled before a smooth voice emerged.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "—and that was 'Moonlight Over Yamoussoukro' by the Lagos Synthetic Orchestra. You're listening to the Midnight Frequency, where we keep you company through the dark hours. I'm your host, Kweku, and before we continue with more neo-Afrobeat fusion, let's check in with the news."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The music faded, replaced by a more serious tone. "Breaking news from our East Asian correspondent: chaos erupted at Taiwan's Amber Moon Spire earlier today as unknown operatives breached the ZenFusion facility. Imperial sources claim the attack was orchestrated by Terra Alliance agents, though the Alliance denies involvement. Witnesses report seeing a blonde woman in beige trench coat entering the ZenFusion facility —"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari's hands tightened on the controls. A blonde Alliance operative in Taiwan? His mind flashed to the news footage from days ago — that same blonde woman with the Psytum Sword in Chicago. Whatever she was involved in, it was escalating.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Imperium of Dragons has issued a statement calling the breach an 'act of war,' while ZenFusion's stock prices plummeted by thirty percent in after-hours trading. More on this story as it develops."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The traffic light shifted to green, but Jabari lingered, listening.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "In related news, speculation continues to mount regarding the so-called 'Moondust Crystal.' Dr. Celine Kamara representing the Kimaris Warband spoke with us earlier today at the University of Accra."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A recorded voice, feminine and sharp, filled the cockpit: "What you're suggesting is unprecedented clash of goals between factions who are usually at each other's throats. When the Alliance and the Imperium suddenly mobilize resources toward the same goal, it suggests something far more significant than mere Zephyrium deposits. As for us — I am not at liberty to say."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Thank you, Dr. Kamara. The Directorate's official position remains that such artifacts are purely speculative. However, our sources indicate increased military activity around key lunar installations. Now, back to the music with 'Binary Sunrise' by—"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari switched off the radio as the Scarab resumed its march. The pieces were falling into place. That Alliance woman, the facility breach in Taiwan, the Mooondust Crystal everyone seemed to be chasing.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As Jabari's mech entered Platinum Crescent Plaza, he noticed the contrast between the old and new. Holographic ads for Medi-Vap and Indra-Sprite flickered beside murals of ancient warriors and elephant herds.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A figure stepped forward from the shadows — a guard in the green-and-gold uniform of the Directorate.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Platinum Crescent security. State your business," the guard demanded.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Scarab's speakers amplified Jabari's reply. "Jabari Adomako, Lieutenant, reporting to the Kimaris Warband."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "So, you're the one Prince Laurent picked?" The guard scoffed. "Couldn't wait until morning to show up? Don't plan on sleeping?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I apologize, sir. My orders were to report in as soon as possible," Jabari explained. Then, he recognized the guard. "Ahmad, is that you?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Glad to see you remember a depot mate, buddy. Truth is, I was told to let you in no matter what time it was," the guard admitted. "Your Kimaris superiors are still awake. Working on some difficult cases."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Difficult cases?" Jabari asked.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Laurent himself. Gone missing. Went on some wild goose chase, so I've heard."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Missing? As in?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Madam Celine can tell you more. Be careful where you park that Scarab, alright?" Ahmad said, stepping aside but still scanning the darkness.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Right. Thanks, Ahmad," Jabari nodded as he continued forward.
  </span>
 </p>
 <span>
  <br/>
  Taken from Royal Road, this narrative should be reported if found on Amazon.
  <br/>
 </span>
 <p>
  <span>
   As the Scarab moved deeper into the plaza, Jabari's sensors highlighted several large containment units near the parking area. The sickly green glow of Helionite leaked from their seams despite the shielding.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Ahmad," Jabari called through the comm, "what are those containers doing here? That's a lot of fusion waste for a civilian plaza."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The guard glanced at the containers and sighed. "Emergency reroute from the Central Processing Plant. They had a power surge from the Summit at Golden Hall. Maintenance promised they'd be gone by morning." He shook his head. "Not great, but what can we do when them higher-ups make decisions, right?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari frowned at the readings. The Helionite concentration was significant enough to register even through the containment. Basic training had taught every cadet that improperly stored Helionite was practically an invitation to...
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Suddenly, the air was filled with chaos; starting with an ominous tremor. Jabari's hands tightened on the Scarab's controls as the earth shook beneath them.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Radi-Mons! Look out!" The guard's voice crackled over the comm-link, panic in his voice.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari's heartbeat quickened, but his mind cleared. This was different from the simulations – this was real. People would die if he failed. An image of his grandmother's broken body flashed through his mind, strengthening his resolve. In reality, there was no room for overthinking – only action.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Here they come," he replied, his voice steady despite his racing heart.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Over a dozen Bone Fiends, their wolf-like forms twisted mockeries of life, erupted in a shower of debris, surrounding the plaza. Their skeletal frames moved unnaturally, drawn by the Helionite's call.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Meanwhile, a shadow spread across the sky above. A massive form descended slowly. Three enormous eyes blinked open, revealing a creature unlike anything natural – a Kraken. The creature was a mass of long arms surrounding a bulbous body, like a mutated octopus the size of a bus.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Skarn shall awaken!" A deep voice boomed from the creature. "He who is both devil and divine! The Blue Garden of Sinners shall bow to his power!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Ahmad's face paled as he looked up. "Shango's Schlong, it can talk?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That's what Krakens do." Jabari said as his mech faced the monster. "It's here to coordinate the Fiends."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Plaza Guards! Rally at the gate!" Ahmad raised his rifle as more guards emerged to join him, all opening fire on the Bone Fiends.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Leave some for me!" Jabari called, calculating his shots. The lives around him – Ahmad, the other guards, civilians in nearby buildings – all depended on him now. This responsibility didn't paralyze him; it focused him.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Around the Scarab, multiple Ologuns in green exosuits formed a line, their Plasma Rifles firing at the Bone Fiends.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   For every monster that fell, another took its place. Above, the Kraken cast down its green ichor. It fell like a curtain, trapping the guards like statues.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "No!" Jabari shouted, memories of his grandmother's death surging forward. The same helplessness threatened to overwhelm him, but he pushed it down. He was not that frightened child anymore.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   His fingers moved across the control panel, bringing the Scarab's weapons online. Armored plates on the mech's head slid open, revealing its gun.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Plasma Spitter, engaged!" he warned the guards as he aimed at the nearest Bone Fiends.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   But his racing heart disrupted his aim. His first shots went wide, hitting the row of fusion-powered cars parked along the plaza's edge.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The vehicles exploded in fireballs that threw shadows across the plaza. Alarms wailed, and lights flashed, illuminating the battlefield.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Lion's loins!" Jabari muttered, the swear doing little to calm him. He took quick breaths as he fought with the controls. He hadn't made such a basic error since his first days of training.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Bone Fiends surged forward, sensing weakness. They swarmed the trapped guards, tearing at them with inhuman hunger. Blood spread across the plaza.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari watched, his heart heavy. Was this happening again? People dying while he did nothing? Just like that night in rural Ghana, when the Bone Fiends had torn through their village, when his grandmother had pushed him into a storage cellar and locked it from outside, sacrificing herself.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   But today would be different. Today he had the power to fight back.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari's Scarab rose up as Bone Fiends climbed onto its armored legs. Their claws scraped against metal as Jabari drove the Scarab forward in a charge.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The ground shook under the mech's weight. Its legs crushed the Radi-Mons beneath. Bone shattered against steel.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "For the Directorate!" he growled, pushing aside his fear. Jabari focused on the Kraken hovering above, its arms spread wide. He moved his hand to another weapon control.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Sun Moon Cannon powered up, panels opening on the Scarab's head. A beam of golden and blue energy shot forth, cutting through the air. His hasty aim wasn't perfect, but the blast hit the Kraken.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Losing two arms, the creature let out a pained shriek. Wounded, it floated higher and retreated, leaving a trail of glowing blood. "Savor your small victory, Earth-Dwellers. The Day of Oblivion will come."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Silence returned to the plaza as the battle ended, leaving behind destruction. Ahmad, battered and covered in the Kraken's green goo, approached the Scarab. His voice was hoarse and tired.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Anansi's ass, Jabari!" he scolded as he limped forward. "Look what you did to the parking lot! What kind of Scarab Rider are you, shooting at a damn parking lot?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari opened the cockpit, climbing down to face Ahmad. "Sorry," he said, regret in his voice. "I got distracted. Remembered something I shouldn't have in combat."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Ahmad studied him, recognition in his eyes. "The Kumasi Incident? I heard about what happened to your grandmother. Half the cadets at the depot knew."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari stiffened. He never talked about it, but of course, word had spread. "Yeah," he replied quietly. "It was a small village outside Kumasi. I was…nevermind."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Well, at least I'm still alive to write up a report on this," the guard said more gently. "If it weren't for you and your Scarab, my men would be Radi-Mon food now. Just like..."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Just like my grandma," Jabari finished. "That's why I'm here, Ahmad. So what happened to her doesn't happen to anyone else."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Ahmad nodded, respect in his eyes. "Power down your Scarab, Lieutenant," he said, pointing to a golden skyscraper towering above them. "See this golden skyscraper? The Topaz High-Rise. The Kimaris Warband is waiting for you on the sixty-sixth floor."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I thought that might be their HQ." Jabari looked at the skyscraper.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Go on now, I'll take care of everything else."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari nodded, encouraged by the understanding in Ahmad's eyes. The Scarab powered down with a hum as Jabari headed for the exit.
  </span>
