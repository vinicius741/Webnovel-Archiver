   Hey everyone,
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   I need to be honest with you all. Over the past week, Nucleus has been hit with multiple low ratings (four 0.5-stars and a 1-star) across different chapters. These ratings target as early as the story’s Prologue, implying the rater didn't even read before rating it.

   No reviews. No explanations. Just silent bombs dropped on something I've been pouring my heart into.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   I'm not going to pretend it doesn't hurt. It does.
  </span>
 </p>

   Royal Road's moderation team has been helpful and removed some of these ratings after investigation, but the others remain. The timing and pattern of these ratings – targeting chapters that have been up for over 40 days without issue – feels deliberate rather than coincidental.

   Writing Nucleus has become a significant part of my life. After 10-hour shifts at my increasingly demanding day job, I come home and instead of unwinding, I'm worldbuilding, plotting, and typing until my fingers ache. I do this because I love creating this universe and sharing it with you all. But this wave of unexplained negative ratings has me questioning if I can sustain this emotionally.

   This is where I turn to you – the readers who've been following along, commenting, theorizing, and sending me messages. If Nucleus has brought you any enjoyment, escape, or made you curious about what happens next,
   <strong>
    could you PLEASE consider leaving a rating or review?

   I'm not asking for sympathy 5-stars – that's not what I want. Just your genuine thoughts on the story, whatever they might be. Even a brief comment about what's working for you would mean a lot.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   I've read and responded to every comment you've all left. They've brightened difficult days, helped me refine the story, and kept me motivated when my energy wanes. Your engagement means everything – not just for visibility on the platform, but for my resilience as a creator.

   Thank you for being part of this journey, especially during this challenging time.
