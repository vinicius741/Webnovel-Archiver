   Next week starts the fifth sprint of my project for my capstone course, so I might end up having to decrease the number of chapters I'm writing soon.

   And next up is the story art. There's a little spoiler picture at the end of a character who has been talked about but not shown in the story yet. I'm kind of curious if anyone can guess who it is :)

   It's in a spoiler if you don't want to see him.

   This is art of Aria on a train:

   Here is some chibi art of Aria that I'll be making into ads soon:

   And this piece of art is of a character who has been spoken about in the story but hasn't been in the story yet. (A short passage showing a reaction doesn't count since his appearance wasn't described) As I said before, I'm just curious if anyone is able to guess who he is :)
