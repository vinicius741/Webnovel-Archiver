   orna deleted Dr. Nikki's message without reading it. Then the second one. By the third ping on her Quantum Watch, she finally glanced at the text: AUTOPSY FINDINGS CRITICAL. ATTEND IMMEDIATELY.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Fuck," she muttered, running a hand through her blonde hair. The week after a Diabolisk kill was supposed to be for recovery, not for staring at its corpse. Her deep blue turtleneck felt suddenly tight as she stood in the corridor, the harsh lighting making her ivroy skin appear almost ghostly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She'd nearly decided to ignore the summons when footsteps approached from behind – the distinctive whir of servo-motors that could only be Thomas's bionic arms.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Trying to avoid the fun?" Thomas asked, a knowing smile on his lips. His combat suit gleamed under the lights.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Some of us don't get excited about dissections, Tom," Lorna replied, unzipping her collar slightly for air. Her trench coat hung on the rail beside her.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Doctor Nikki found something," Thomas said, his expression turning serious. "Something about the genetic makeup that doesn't match our previous encounters. She's already briefed Director Otis."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna's interest piqued despite herself. If Otis was involved, this wasn't routine. "The same Director Otis who never sets foot in medical unless it's world-ending?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The very same." Thomas gestured toward the lab entrance, his bionic hand catching the light. "Shall we?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna sighed, squaring her shoulders. "Fine. But we're buying coffee after this."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Deal," Thomas said, stepping closer than necessary as they approached the lab's decontamination chamber. "Though I was thinking maybe dinner instead — ?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Thomas." Lorna's tone carried a warning as she stepped away. "Not now."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The decontamination spray hissed around them, filling the awkward silence. Through the glass, Lorna could see Dr. Nikki bent over a massive form draped in smart-fabric, her traditional blue and white garments stark against the sterile environment. The doctor's face showed an intensity Lorna had rarely seen – whatever she'd found in that creature's corpse had disturbed her.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Ready?" Thomas asked as the chamber doors began to slide open.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna nodded, already regretting her decision to come. But something in Nikki's expression told her this wasn't going to be a normal autopsy. Not by a long shot.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>

  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Autopsy Lab, Level 88, Stardust Command, 1901 Patriot Way, Evanston, IL 60201, Terra Alliance territory
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The autopsy lab was bright and clinical, with holographic displays showing data in blue. Dr. Nikki stood at its center, her long black hair in a neat braid contrasting with her white coat.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Her dark eyes behind thick-rimmed glasses showed both excitement and worry. "Lieutenant Weiss, Lieutenant Mendoza. Thank you for coming."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The lab's fusion core hummed beneath their feet. Through glass panels in the floor, Lorna could see the building's Zephyrium processing chamber – a vast space where blue-white crystals pulsed with light. Coolant pipes along the walls carried Helionite to containment facilities underground. The waste product's green glow cast shifting shadows across the lab's surfaces.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Diabolisk's massive form dominated the room. Even dead, the creature commanded attention – its copper-scaled hide reflecting the lab's lights, rows of spines running down its back. Its head alone was the size of a small car, with teeth that could cut through titanium.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Alright, Doc. What was so urgent?" Lorna asked, keeping her distance from the corpse. She noticed an acrid smell – like burnt metal mixed with rotting flesh.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "This." Dr. Nikki gestured to a holographic display floating above the creature's chest. DNA strands rotated in three dimensions, portions highlighted in red. "Sixty percent of its genetic structure matches human DNA. Not similar to previous cases."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Thomas's bionic hand clenched audibly. "That's impossible."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That's what I thought," Nikki replied, adjusting her glasses. "I ran the analysis seventeen times. The margin of error is zero." She walked around to the creature's head. "This thing wasn't just mutated from human stock or a Radi-Mon egg – it was born from a human mother."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna felt her throat tighten. "Born? You mean..."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yes. Somewhere out there, women are being..." Nikki's professional demeanor cracked slightly. "....used as breeding stock for these creatures."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Thomas moved closer to the display. "Any way to trace where these women came from?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That's where it gets interesting," Nikki said, tapping commands into her datapad. New images appeared – genetic markers highlighted in various colors. "The maternal DNA shows strong markers common in Scandinavia. Specifically, Norway."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna's hand instinctively moved to touch a Nordic pendant hidden beneath her turtleneck. Her voice remained neutral as she asked, "How recent? Could this be connected to the disappearances during the Nordic Exodus?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Difficult to say, given how the Exodus was 11 years ago," Nikki began, but was interrupted by the lab doors sliding open.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Director Otis strode in, his white suit immaculate, his presence commanding attention. His lined face looked grave. "Dr. Chakraborty, I need your preliminary report. Now."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Behind him, Diego entered quietly in his tailored black suit, a quantum laptop under his arm. His expression was unreadable as he took position near the door.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna caught Thomas's eye, a silent question passing between them. This wasn't a routine autopsy anymore. Something bigger was brewing, and the Diabolisk's secrets were just the beginning.
  </span>
 </p>

   Stellar Nexus, Room 1701, 170th Floor, Stardust Command, 1901 Patriot Way, Evanston, IL 60201, Terra Alliance territory
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The transition from medical sterility to simulated cosmos was jarring. The Stellar Nexus created the illusion of floating among stars, with distant nebulae swirling across dark walls.
  </span>
 </p>
 <span>

 <p>
  <span>
   Across from her hung a silver plaque that read 'Stardust International Mobile Unit,' with the letters 'S,' 'I,' 'M,' and 'U' in luminescent paint, casting a gentle light.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I assume the autopsy findings justify interrupting everyone's recovery time," Lorna said, settling into a chair. She'd retrieved her beige trench coat, but left it draped over her seat. The deep blue of her partially unzipped turtleneck matched the simulated space around them.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Director Otis stood at the head of the table in his signature white suit. "What we've learned only underscores the urgency of our next mission." He gestured to Diego, who immediately began typing on his quantum laptop.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A holographic image materialized above the table – a sweet potato-shaped island floating in an azure sea. "Taiwan, an island that used to be its own country in the Digital Age," Diego said, standing up. "The Amber Moon Spire holds a crucial secret that could potentially shift the balance of power in our favor against the Imperium of Dragons."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The image shifted to reveal the Amber Moon Spire - a stunning fusion of traditional Asian architecture and modern engineering. The pagoda's silhouette featured twelve ascending tiers, each level smaller than the last, with sweeping upturned eaves.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Our intelligence suggests that ZenFusion Dynamics, a mega corporation endorsed by the Imperium, has uncovered something that could turn the tide against the Radi-Mons," Diego continued. "Data regarding an artifact called the Moondust Crystal."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Let me guess," Thomas interjected, his bionic fingers drumming on the table. "The Imperium wants it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "While we're yet uncertain about the Crystal's capabilities, it's vital that we keep it out of the Imperium's hands," Otis said, adjusting his glasses. "The thought of the Imperium finding and deploying it against the rest of the world is almost too grim to consider."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "A corporation this size must have security measures in place. How do we breach them without causing harm to civilians?" Lorna asked, gesturing towards the hologram.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Amber Moon Spire, like most Imperium buildings, has a central power room with a panel that can only be accessed by individuals with high Aether reserves and psionic abilities. If a Psi Lynx were to disable the power supply using this method, another could enter and exit undetected," Diego explained. "We've chosen the perfect candidate for this task, but he is —"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The doors opened once again, and Emmanuel walked in, sporting his battle-worn combat armor. His locs fell down his shoulders as he made his way to the table, looking both casual and composed.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Manny, you're late," Diego frowned.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Apologies, Diego. Had an appointment with Doctor Nikki," Emmanuel replied as he took a seat next to Lorna. The scent of earthy musk surrounded him. "So — did I miss anything?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Diego just assigned you to manipulate this building's power supply on our next mission," Lorna said, pointing at the hologram.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "So, just like that mission we did in Hanoi?" Emmanuel asked, looking over the hologram as he leaned on his hand. "What's Lorna going to do, then?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I'm glad you asked," Diego replied with a smile. "Lorna will retrieve the Moondust Crystal's data from the Main Server Room. Meanwhile, Thomas and I will be standing by on my StarWhale shuttle in case of any problems —"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Okay. Stop right there, amigo," Emmanuel said, waving his hand. "Sounds like you're assigning Lorna to the most dangerous part of the mission. Let me do it instead."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "No need for that. Lorna is more than capable—" Diego began to stand.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I'm sure she is," Emmanuel interrupted, pointing at Diego. "But I have some tricks up my sleeve too. I could sneak into the Main Server Room using my psionic cloaking spells and retrieve the data undetected."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "But we don't know what challenges may arise, Manny," Diego raised a finger. "There could be ZenFusion employees patrolling the area. Are you prepared to rely on your words instead of your weapons?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Hmm," Emmanuel stroked his chin. "Can't remember the last time I did that."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Manny, it's okay. I can do this," Lorna turned to Emmanuel with a tight smile.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Very well then. You know your strengths, Lorna," Emmanuel nodded, seemingly satisfied.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "While we don't have complete intelligence on the Crystal's capabilities, keeping it from the Imperium is paramount," Otis said, adjusting his glasses. "Particularly given recent developments."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Emmanuel leaned forward. "You mean their new deal with Moscovia? The weapons trading?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Among other things," Diego replied, typing on his laptop. New holograms appeared – satellite images of massive construction projects across Mars and Venus. "The Imperium isn't just fighting Radi-Mons anymore. The Pentagon thinks they're studying them. Weaponizing them."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Absurdity," Thomas interjected, his bionic hand clenching. "Those Imperials never give up."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "They believe they can control them," Otis cut in. "And if our intelligence about the Crystal is accurate, they might be right." He paused. "Imagine the Imperium with an army of controlled Radi-Mons. They'd be unstoppable."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna's mind flashed to the Diabolisk in the lab below, to its human DNA. "So while we're fighting these monsters, the Imperium's trying to turn them into weapons?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It gets worse," Diego said quietly. "We have reports of Imperial scientists working with captured specimens. Experimenting. Breeding." The last word hung in the air like poison.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Emmanuel swore under his breath. "And now they're after something that could control them all."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I'll take the mission," Lorna said firmly. The churning in her gut wasn't just fear anymore – it was anger. "If the Imperium wants to play with monsters, they can deal with us instead."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The building has an underground Helionite sewage system," Diego continued, bringing up new schematics. "Connected to a nearby Starport. Minimal guards, access to a cargo lift." His expression hardened. "But remember – no public engagements. The last thing we need is to give the Imperium an excuse for open warfare while they're building their monster army."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "When do we start?" she asked.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Tomorrow," Otis replied. "Their main forces will be occupied with military exercises in the South China Sea." He looked each of them in the eye. "We have one shot at this. Make it count."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
  <span>
   168th Floor, Stardust Command, 1901 Patriot Way, Evanston, IL 60201, Terra Alliance territory
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The trip down from the 170th floor felt longer than usual. Lorna stood alone in the Quantum Lift, watching the numbers tick down, until it stopped at the 88th. The doors opened to reveal Thomas waiting, his bionic arm reflecting the corridor's lights, his blonde hair similar to hers.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Mind if I ride down with you?" he asked, though he was already stepping inside.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna shifted to make room, noticing how he stood closer than necessary in the spacious lift. "Sure."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Listen," Thomas began as the doors closed. "About what I said last month—"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Thomas." She turned to face him, taking in his earnest expression, the way his bionic hands flexed unconsciously. "You're a good man. What happened during that vacation in Boston… And in Chicago... It was good."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "But?" he said.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "But…I'm not looking for what you're offering." She softened her tone, remembering the way he'd fought beside her against the Diabolisk, how his metal arms had shielded her from its flames. "The timing isn't right. And honestly? I don't think it ever will be."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The lift continued down, floors passing by. Thomas's jaw worked for a moment before he spoke. "Is this about Emmanuel?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A small smile played at Lorna's lips. "It's about me. Emmanuel understands that. We enjoy each other's company without expectations." She straightened up. "I like my freedom, Thomas. And after what we learned today about the Imperium, about these women being used..." She touched her pendant again. "I need to stay focused."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The lift slowed, approaching the ground floor. Thomas nodded slowly, his metallic fingers no longer fidgeting. "I understand. Just be careful, alright?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Always am." The doors opened to the lobby, its marble floors gleaming under crystal chandeliers. "Besides, you'll be watching my back from Diego's StarWhale."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That's not what I meant," he replied, disappointment in his voice.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna stepped out of the elevator, then turned back to face him. "I know. Thanks for understanding."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He managed a smile, though it didn't quite reach his eyes. "Let's give them hell tomorrow."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Count on it." She watched the doors close, waited until the lift began its ascent, then pulled out her Quantum Watch. Her fingers moved across its blue holographic interface.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "
   <em>
    Hey, Manny. Still up for that drink tonight?
   </em>
   " she typed into her watch.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The response came almost immediately: "
   <em>
    Quantum Pour? 21:00?
   </em>
   "
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna smiled, already thinking of the gray sofa in her usual booth, of conversations that wouldn't demand more than she could give. Perfect.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She stepped out into the Evanston evening, her trench coat flowing behind her in the winter wind. Above, the stars were emerging one by one, like distant watches in the growing dark. Tomorrow would bring danger, secrets, and perhaps answers to questions she'd carried since childhood. But tonight was hers to spend as she pleased.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The pendant felt warm against her skin as she walked away from the towering spire, leaving the day's responsibilities behind.
  </span>
