<p class="cnMzODA2NzY3NzJjYzRiY2ZiMTFlZGNlMDk1NmYwNjQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Prefect's Study, No. 1 Zhongshan S Rd, Taipei, Taiwan, Imperium of Dragons territory</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZWJiYjJiMWJjMjRhZWNiMmMwN2NhYmY5Yzc2OWI4"><img alt="Nucleus: The Dust of Moon" src="https://nucleusseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ch12.png"/></p>
<p class="cnNkMWRhMmE4ZWE1MDQyNzliMGMwMzdkODc1ZDU3ZGNl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><span style="font-size: 1.5em"><strong>D</strong></span>awn crept across Taipei as Dilinur reviewed footage in her study. Her black hair was in an updo, held by a hairpin with a red gem. A few loose strands showed she'd been working for hours instead of maintaining the refined appearance expected of an Imperial Prefect.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4Njk0ZTI4OGRlMjRjNmNhYjg5NWNkMGFhM2IxMjli"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Play it again," she said, despite the unease in her stomach.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4Zjg3OGFlNjU2MzQ1NWY5NjZjMGRiNTBkZDg1YWVj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The display showed a woman strapped to a chair. Blood dripped from her nose as Dilinur's voice came through speakers: "The Crystal's location. One more time."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NTYwNmQ2YjgyZDRlMzdiZTZlYWM2YWQwYjcyMzBj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur watched herself work. Her black silk robe brushed the floor as she stepped closer to the screen.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTFjZTRlYTY5YjQyMDE4ODAwNjJhOWViNGM2ZTll"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She paused the recording when the subject's skin started to bubble under her Eclipse spells.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYmE1YWNjOWM2ODQ0MzU5OGU3ZWJhYzg0MWRkZGRl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Vault of…Primal Urges," the prisoner finally said. "But an oppressed soul like yourself will never understand its power."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYzA4N2FjNWZjODRjYTNhMWVmZDZhYjVkODc5OWNm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A message appeared: 'GOVERNOR QIN ARRIVING VIA HOLOGRAM IN 45 MINUTES. COURT ASSEMBLY REQUIRED.'</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Y2EwMmY5MmI3NzQ2ZTU5NjZmMjIyMmIyMmUzMzhi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur touched her jade hairpin, a habit she'd never broken. How many more sessions before she stopped feeling each scream? Before she became the monster the Imperium wanted?</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MjQ4ZTVmM2FiYjQ2ZmM5N2YzYjlmODRjZGNmNTAz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She turned to the window. Beyond the glass, Taipei's skyline blazed with lights, each building showing Imperium power. The Amber Moon Spire cut through the clouds, its Main Server Cluster holding secrets worth killing for.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTk3MmVjYmRjNDRjODlhN2Y0NDUxMzVmMWVjODg2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Another message appeared: 'SUBJECT PROCESSED. ORGAN HARVEST SUCCESSFUL. AVAILABLE FOR USE. AT THE GENOME SEQUENCER.'</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDM3MzY4OWQ1MzQ0MTNhZDc4NzA2NjQ1ZDEwMDI0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur gripped her hairpin until her knuckles turned white. Another death, another "contribution" to the Imperium's secret weapon. She remembered the woman's last words about family in Tainan. Would they ever know what happened to their daughter? Or would she just disappear, like others who defied the Imperium?</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NmQyNDIxZWNhZTQ4N2JhNmU0YjhhZTU2MmZjMDVj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">An amber glow drew her attention. The Genome Sequencer hummed as it processed the latest sample. Dilinur approached, her reflection warped in its surface.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMGRjYTAwODg0NjRmZjdiZTg2ZjM1OTRkYzg0YzRi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Sequencer! Status report," she commanded.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzODNkOTg1ZTUwNjQ4ZmRhOWFiOTczYjdiYzZkMDA4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Primary sequencing complete. Genetic integration proceeding as scheduled. Current progress: 87%," the machine replied in a female voice.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYWVlYTU1MDUwZDQxODBiMGVkYjVhNjYzMzAwMjAx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A hologram appeared showing cells forming in vats beneath the building. What started as tissue from failed revolutionaries was becoming something monstrous – a bioweapon against both Alliance forces and Radi-Mons.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZjg1Njc5ZDBkNTRmNmVhNGNiOGJjOThhOWYzZWI5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Time projection until Flesh Pot reaches viable status?" she asked, studying the cellular formations.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MTA2YjE4NmQyOTQ0NzNiNTdmNzdjMzEwOGMxMWMz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Seven Earth days until preliminary viability. Thirteen days until the Radi-Mon designated 'Flesh Pot' is ready for combat," the machine answered.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YTEyYTA1ZmE4ZDRkMjNhZDZmYzM5ODg5YzZhOTNk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur nodded, watching the cells divide. The rebel's genetic material worked well with the Radi-Mon she was tasked with building. Perhaps the woman's defiance would become ferocity in the Imperium's arsenal.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NzVkZjI2ZGQwYjQyZjJhYjQyNzFkYmRkMjJiMmM2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Survival demands sacrifice," she muttered. How often had her superiors used that phrase? How often had she repeated it to herself before dawn?</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMTI0ZWMwOGZkMTQ1MDhhOGU3YTBhY2EyY2U1MjFi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She dismissed the projection. The machine continued working, amber light pulsing as it sent instructions to chambers below. Flesh Pot would be their creation – a living weapon made from those who defied the Imperium. A monster overseen by someone afraid of becoming a monster herself.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZmQ2YzE0OTMyMzQ1ZGNhOGRjYTQ3ZmNhZTQyZjM2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She adjusted her robe. Every detail mattered with Governor Qin. Even appearing by hologram, his demand for protocol was legendary. One mistake could ruin her work and compromises to reach this position.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZmZiNTViNmE0NzRiNjdiMjI2MTFkY2UzYTRmMzQ2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A third message appeared: 'UNUSUAL ENERGY SIGNATURES DETECTED AT AMBER MOON SPIRE. LEVEL 50. SECURITY PROTOCOLS ENGAGING.'</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NzVlMGE4NDE4ZjQ0MWE5OWZlZjdhNDI3ODMwN2Zh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur froze. The Crystal's data was on level 117. If someone was trying to access it from below... but she couldn't check yet. Not with Governor Qin coming.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZDEzNGFmMDU0NDRhYTY5NWQ0MjhkYTAzNmEyNDUw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">In the Imperium, survival meant playing the game, climbing the ladder until you could actually make a difference.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NmZjZjQ2OWM3YjQ4MjNhYmZlZjY2NjQ3ZDg4ZTQ3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">If you lived that long.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MmU5MGE5Njg4MzQwMDRiZGM4MjlkMGM0M2M4NmQ1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She squared her shoulders, lifting her chin. The dragons on her robe seemed to move as she walked to the door. Behind her, the Genome Sequencer worked silently, creating life from death, mixing human flesh into something unholy.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZjdhYzkyZTAxMjQwMTFiNzdkOWU5NjAzM2YzOTlj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The morning's court would determine the fate of the Moondust Crystal data, the programmer Zhi-Xin Wu, and his android – and whether Dilinur could maintain her balance between duty and humanity.</span></p>

<p class="cnNhNjRlMTMxYzBhMzQwM2U5OWY3Njc4Zjk2YmY4MTk1"><strong><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">06:30, February 10, 2295</span></strong></p>
<p class="cnMwOWNmODg5Yzg2YjQ3NjBhMDZiYjQ2MDg0NzhkZjNl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Prefect's Court, 88F, Amber Moon Spire (琥月塔), ZenFusion Taipei branch, No. 7, Section 5, Xinyi District, Taipei, Taiwan, Imperium of Dragons territory</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOTAwZDRhNWRhNDQ3MDQ5OTljOWJhYjRmNWM5NWNh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Prefect has arrived!" announced the Bloodtrooper at the door.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDMzMTBiMGY5MjRmOTU5Yjk5MzJiYzZhMjU2ZjYx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The heavy doors of the Prefect's Court opened with a clang. Morning light streamed through tall windows across the marble floor. The room wasn't large – the Imperium preferred smaller spaces for governance – but its walls showed tapestries of dragons ascending to heaven.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYjEzYmE4NmM0ODQ0MDVhNWQxYWZiMWIzM2NkNDM1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Unlike Alliance's hidden approach or the Directorate's spread-out systems, the Imperium showed its fusion power openly. The chamber's east wall was clear, revealing a massive Zephyrium core that filled the room with amber light. The crystal structure, five stories tall, pulsed with energy that made the air taste like metal.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZmNkOGZlOTc0MzRkMzBiMWVjYzAyYjNmNTkxZDIz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"At ease. We have much to discuss today," she said as she walked to her raised seat. Below her, arranged in a half-circle, sat the officials who helped maintain the Imperium's control over Taiwan. Their faces revealed nothing, but she felt them watching her. Every session tested whether she deserved to rule them.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZTM0Y2YzM2EwYTRmZTk5YmI5ZGU4Y2M4ZThkNjZk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">To her right stood Cheng Wei, her Seneschal, solid in his red armor and loyalty. His face remained calm, but she noticed his jaw tighten – he'd seen the morning's reports too.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNDY4ZWMwZDY3YTQwNTRhZjk5MjA3ZmIzZGY0ZmNk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Governor Qin's transmission will begin momentarily," said a technician, adjusting the hologram projector in the center of the room.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMTA0MGJjNTFjYzRiZmVhM2IwYzVhNDEyNGYyY2Vi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Shazmeen Varma, the Secretary of Province, sat in her place with coiled grace. Her dark skin and striking features stood out among the mostly Chinese officials – another "outsider" the Imperium found useful. The patterns in her braided hair and the gold threads in her robes showed wealth and influence, but Dilinur knew better than to trust such displays.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NWI1MDhhMTZiNzQ3YWY5YTNjOGNiYTBhOGU3NTk1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Prefect Altai," Shazmeen said with slight amusement, "I trust the morning's intelligence has been illuminating?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MWViNWUyOTM0OTRmNDA4MmRhMjkwYzJiNTlhOTM2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Before Dilinur could answer, the air shimmered and Governor Zu-Shao Qin's hologram appeared. Even through the blue-tinted image, his presence commanded attention. His bald head and sharp features gave him a predatory look, so did his black and red robes.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYjEzNDk0OTliZjRjMDViMjA4YzdjMTcxYzg1YmYw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Remarkable," Shao's voice filled the room, rich with scorn, "how our Prefect manages to arrive precisely on schedule, while the Crystal's data remains frustratingly elusive."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZjI3MDdmYWFlMjQ3MGNiNzQwOGZhYTdhYzRkZjdl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur nodded, just enough to show respect without submission. "Governor, the data is secured in the level 117 cluster. Our engineers have verified—"</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMTNmY2U4ODFmNjQ0MWI4ZjNmMDkzZWU1YzY3NTAw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Verification means nothing without results," Shao cut her off. "The Emperor grows impatient. While our forces battle the Alliance across the Five Realms, we're meant to trust the most significant discovery of the age to...a band of Unblooded and outsiders?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMmVhMDA0Njk4NjQ2M2JhZjU2NGQyZjg4NzM4ZWNi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The pause before those last words made their meaning clear. Unblooded. Outsider. Temporary convenience.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNmIyYjU2OGMzNzRmNDBhNmMwMDk2YTg3MDllYjVk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"My lord," Dilinur kept her voice steady, "perhaps we should discuss the latest developments regarding—"</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OTc0OGQwMDNlZTRiMmU4NTdhNmU2ZTEzMDgxZjZm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A commotion at the entrance interrupted her. Two Bloodtroopers entered, their red armor catching the morning light. Between them stood a prisoner in simple clothes, his face bruised.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MjkzZTE1NTEyNDQwZGY5MjBiZjhiYzM4NTkxNzM3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Apologies for the interruption," the first trooper said, "but we've captured a rebel courier. Claims to have information about Alliance movements near the Crystal's suspected location."</span></p><span class="cjk2OWVjOWI2MzBkZTQzODA5MTEyMDM1ZmNlYmMwMTBi"><br/>Unauthorized tale usage: if you spot this story on Amazon, report the violation.<br/></span>
<p class="cnMyNzE3MDE4MzI2NDRjYjViMGQ1ZmYzYWFlMDI3Mzc2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur felt Shao's holographic gaze sharpen with interest. She recognized the look – a predator smelling blood.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZTA2MzBiNDY3YzQ3NzJhYTAyYmU2MzMzZjMwNTZl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Well then, Prefect," Shao's lips curved slightly, "shall we see how provincial management handles this opportunity?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNDg1MDNiMzIxYzQwNTFiYThhYmM1MmU3MDQ2MmYy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur studied the prisoner. Young – barely twenty, she guessed. Local features, but his bearing suggested military training. The bruises were precise. The Bloodtroopers had known exactly how much force to use.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MjUyNjAxOWMxZTQwZmI5ZTk2Y2UzZmU0ZDU0NjM1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Speak," she commanded.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTdkOTI5OWEwNzQ4OTVhOTQxYTg4MmI0YmFkOGE1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The prisoner lifted his chin defiantly despite his bonds. "The Terra Alliance knows about the Crystal. They're mobilizing a strike force. I can tell you where—"</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OGMwMmY5MDY0MzRlMzZiMWFmYWQ4MTY5NTYzNGIx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You'd sacrifice your comrades so easily?" Dilinur's voice carried just enough doubt to bait the hook.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYzAwYjFiYzE5NjQyMWY5YmRiNzg0ZTdkZDJhZGEz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"They're…not my comrades anymore." Blood trickled from his split lip as he spoke. "The Alliance s-s-scums... they're working with the Emerald Directorate now. S-s-sharing intelligence about—"</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDBjOWZjNDk0MzRlNjBhNWVkNjc3Zjk3M2I0MThm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Alliance working with the apes?" A harsh laugh from Shao's hologram cut through the chamber. "And I'm the Mayor of Celestial Reach!"</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzU3Zjc5NzYxOTQ2NDRhOTVjOWM1MTI4MzA4NzRj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The prisoner's eyes widened slightly – Dilinur had seen that look before. The look of someone realizing their lie had failed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZWYwNWZkOTIyNzQ3N2I5ZTk1MmE3MmUzN2M5YWVj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Allow me to demonstrate why the Emperor trusts Taiwan's management," she rose smoothly from her seat, Eclipse energy beginning to coil around her fingers, "Maa-nik-ya Yaa-ta-naa!"</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZDZlMTUyYWEwMDRhYjg5MTZkNGYyNGQ3ZmFjMTE0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The first spell caught the prisoner in his throat, choking off whatever lie he'd been about to tell. The second spell made his blood vessels visible through his skin, a map of vulnerabilities waiting to be exploited.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NjQzMjlmYTczZDRkMjY5YjI3NzE1NjkxOTYxMmIy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Alliance movements?" she asked softly, letting him feel the pressure building in his arteries. "Or perhaps something about that disturbance we detected here in the Spire?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMTA2YWUyNGM3MTQ1YTZiZGViZTUwNWUxY2NjMGE2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">His eyes betrayed him before he could speak. A quick glance toward the windows, toward the tower's silhouette in the distance.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTA3MWE4ZThjNTQ3ZWJhMmVlYzcyNTgxNDkxMGQw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Prefect," Cheng Wei stepped forward, his armor clanking, "the timing suggests—"</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYjVlMzYwYjUxZDRmOWI5YThmOTczZTljYmE2Mjc5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"A diversion," Dilinur finished. She released her spell, letting the prisoner collapse gasping to the floor. "While we're occupied here, someone else moves on the Crystal data."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMzhmNjYzMGFiYzRhMTBhZmQ4NWI1YjljM2RjYTU0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Shao's hologram flickered with barely contained fury. "If the Alliance breaches our servers —"</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MTM5MDYwMGM1OTRmZmQ5YTBiOTA2ZTU4MjYxYWM1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"They won't, Governor Qin," Dilinur cut in, earning shocked looks from the assembled officials. One did not simply interrupt the Governor. "Because this isn't Alliance methodology. Their operatives don't sacrifice pawns so inefficiently."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyM2RiODY3MDVjZDRjNGViZGU2MWQ2YTI2ZDkzMjkx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She turned to Shazmeen. "The prisoner's accent. You noted it?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMDc0Y2IwN2EyNjQ3Njk5YzRiMTcyODM3Y2E4ZGZl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A slow smile spread across the Secretary's face. "Tainan inflections. Local resistance, not foreign agents."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZDBiMDU0MzE1NTRjMDU4NzVlZjI0ZWQwNjIxYjEx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Remove him," Dilinur commanded. As the Bloodtroopers dragged the prisoner away, she turned back to Shao's hologram. "My lord, this attempt at infiltration raises concerns about our other... guest at the Spire."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNmY1N2M5N2VhZTRiNzQ5M2ZiNzU1NTE1NjQ2MGU2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The chamber's atmosphere shifted noticeably. Even Shazmeen's usual composure wavered slightly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MzE5NTM2OTY3ZDRmODA5MWRiOGM0ZDY3YWY4NzBm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Subject S," Shao's holographic features hardened. "Your midnight report indicated another failed conditioning attempt."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDlmODk4NjBhYTRiNTJhZTY1MGIzMDQwZmIyMDQx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Radi-Mon's resistance to our control methods is unprecedented," Dilinur acknowledged. "Even with our most advanced neural suppressants, Subject S maintains a disturbing level of autonomy. Yesterday's test resulted in the loss of three more Bloodtroopers."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYWIzOTFmMzNjODRkMmNhYWQ2MGNmZmE2MDdjZjg4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"And yet," Shao's voice dripped with disdain, "despite these failures, you advocate maintaining him at the Spire?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZjMxOTJjOGI1NDQ5NjZhMTdlMTQyYjAzZjkwZDZl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The intelligence we've gathered suggests the Moondust Crystal could be key to severing this connection," Dilinur responded carefully. "Our translations of ancient Neptunian texts found in the Mainland indicate it was originally designed to suppress certain forms of consciousness."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOTQ1ZTk4YjFlMTQ2MzdiYWY1ZTAwMzg5ZTI2NGQ0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Cheng Wei stepped forward, his red armor catching the light. "If I may, Prefect - our Conjurers sent an update. Subject S appears to possess a connection to something they call 'the Hivemind'. This entity reinforces his will against our interventions."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMWYzMTY3NDc1ZDQ1YTY5YTUyN2I5NTQ3YjhkNmIz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"But if we could adapt the Moondust Crystal's property," Dilinur continued, "we wouldn't just control Subject S. We could potentially control entire Radi-Mon hordes."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MDIzZjQ4NjEzODRkM2E4MTUzODczZDRlYjUxZTk4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Shao's hologram flickered as he leaned forward, interest in his cold eyes. "Bold claims. What evidence supports this theory?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOTRjYzRmN2M5ZjQ2YTdiNGIwNzBkNzAyZWM3YzMz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Shazmeen rose from her seat, her golden-threaded robes catching the morning light. "The research facility in Hsinchu has completed preliminary analysis of Subject S's neural patterns. They align remarkably with fragments we've decoded from the Crystal's data structure."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YzViYzE5OTU1YjQwMjNiNTU0MDdhMWU2NGYyNjEy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Our forces across the Five Realms are stretched thin containing Radi-Mon incursions — and fighting those Alliance dogs. " Shao's tone sharpened, "The Emperor questions why such a crucial task falls to provincial management."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MDVkMWY5NWVhOTQyOWU5NGNmMTUwOGU3ZDk2YTQy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The slight pause before those words made several officials shift uncomfortably. Dilinur felt the familiar weight of scrutiny – every Unblooded who rose through Imperial ranks lived beneath it.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYmFkN2QwNGUyYzRjZjQ5YjU4M2M2ODA0OWNiMGFh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Precisely because our forces are engaged elsewhere, my lord," Dilinur countered smoothly. "Taiwan's unique position – our technological infrastructure, our distance from major conflict zones, our — expendability in the Emperor's grand designs – makes us ideal for this endeaver."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OTZkYTYxYzA4YTQ2YzNiMjIyODEwN2FhNTk2YzZk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Not to mention," Shazmeen added, her voice like silk-wrapped steel, "small nations to the south are watching us, entertaining thoughts of helping the Emerald Directorate of the Terra Alliance. An ability to control Radi-Mons could prove — persuasive."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MGJkOTZkZTZlNjQyNTY4NGI4NTg4OTE4ZTkzZmFl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Shao's holographic features remained impassive, but Dilinur recognized the calculating look in his eyes. The political implications weren't lost on him.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZGIwMjljYmY4ZDQ3ZDU5MGRjZmFlYjQ0NjUzYjli"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"And what of our more immediate security concerns?" he asked finally. "This programmer and his... machine."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2M2YxZGQ5MWEyYjQyMDM4NjVkYmEzMmU0ZTVlZjVi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As if summoned by Qin's words, the chamber's displays flickered to life, showing security footage from the Amber Moon Spire. A Da-Ji android – U6-M9 – stood in her cell, hands pressed against the containment field. Unlike standard android behavior, she paced, her movements jarringly human.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YzcxNGIwMmI5YTRjYjA5MmYwOTdmYzBmZTMzYmNi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"If you would, please observe," Dilinur manipulated the display with a gesture, splitting the screen to show multiple angles. "Three days of footage. She hasn't entered standard charging mode once. No repetitive patterns. No routines."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMjkzMjk4ODAyYjQxOTBhMTQ2YmU5YWJiMGNlMDZl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"'It', Dinu. That thing is no human," Shao's hologram moved through the displays like a shark through dark water. "But ZenFusion's pride in their Da-Ji line makes more sense now. They've created something that can perfectly mimic — weakness."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZWYwZDgwZTExMjQ5Yzg4MmNjZjJkN2YxNGI5ZTRl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The footage shifted to show Xin's initial arrest. As the Bloodtroopers dragged him away, U6-M9 fought against her captors with unexpected ferocity. The audio crackled through the chamber: "I won't comply! Let go of me!"</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Y2RhMzY0MTk3NDRmNmRhNjc1OThkZDM3M2I5MDA1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Several officials flinched at the android's outburst. Even Cheng Wei's calm expression cracked slightly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZDZhZWZmYzllYjQyNGQ5NWIwMGI5MjNlODM5MzE2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"An android that rejects direct commands," Shazmeen mused, rising to examine the footage more closely. Her shadow cut across the projections. "Fascinating, but irrelevant to our larger concerns. The resources required to study this anomaly would be better spent on Subject S."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OWMwMGIxYjUwNTQ1ZGY5NDg0Njk5YzQzYzcxNjM3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Unless," Dilinur stepped into the maze of projections, her figure intersecting with the frozen images of struggle, "there's a connection we're missing. Wu Zhi-Xin's expertise in neural programming. His access to an Android Modifier — no doubt off the black market – "</span></p>
<p class="cnNmY2M4ZDFjMzM3MzRjZjRiYzY1MDNhYmM2OTFhZGMx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A low tremor shook the chamber, making the projections waver. Deep beneath their feet, the Helionite processing systems hummed with increased activity.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyM2VjZjYxOWQ0MjQ3MDA5N2U2YjkzNWFjYjI0ZGI3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You suspect he could assist with Subject S?" Qin asked, his hologram cutting through the displays to fix Dilinur with a penetrating stare.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMzRjMTE5MmI3NTQ2ZGE5MTRlMzRhYjExNGU3Mjhk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I suspect we shouldn't be too hasty in dismissing either of them," Dilinur replied carefully. "However, keeping them both at high security would strain our already limited resources."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Y2FiZjNhYWRmYTQ2ZDFiMjk1MWNhMzdhMmVkYzBk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"A cogent point." Shao gestured, and the projections shifted to display Amber Moon Spire's security allocations. Red markers showed the concentration of Bloodtroopers around Subject S's containment level. "Our forces are already stretched thin maintaining one high-risk prisoner. The android is..."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YTlhZTM3MTI5YTQ3ZTdhYTdjZjkxYzBjYTk4MWI5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Another tremor, stronger this time, interrupted him. The quantum displays flickered, momentarily showing power fluctuations throughout the Spire.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNGM2YTA0YWM3MzQyYmFhNTllYzQ3NzZiMjllMTE5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Merely a corporate asset that its user grew too attached to," Shazmeen finished, her fingers trailing through the holographic readouts. "A common enough failing among socially disconnected salarymen."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZmNiMmYyYzQyNjQ0NDhhMTM1ZjJmNDg3YWNmYjhj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"True enough," Dilinur met Shao's gaze through the shifting projections, "To that end, I suggest we place U6-M9 in Cargo Hold 6 of the Bishan Logistics Hub, under moderate security. If she's truly just a malfunctioning android, we conserve resources. If she's something more..." She let the implication hang in the air.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YTIzODM0ZmJjMTRmZmZiMjY3ZmJmMTQwNWFlNDdk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The chamber fell silent save for the deepening hum of fusion cores beneath their feet. Through the windows, Amber Moon Spire loomed against the morning sky, its upper levels disappearing into low clouds.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZDQ2MDA1ZmYxYTQ4OTY4NzA4ZDQyN2NkNjI5ZTI5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Shazmeen turned to face Shao's hologram. "We have more pressing concerns than a lovesick programmer and his toy. Subject S's latest readings show increasing neural activity. If we don't strengthen our control soon—"</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTM4ZDMzMzE2OTQzM2ViZjhlNzEzOTU2Mzc5OTA4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The chamber's lighting suddenly pulsed red. Emergency alerts cascaded across the quantum displays, transforming the dignified space into a chaos of warning signals and flashing data.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNGZlNjhlYTdlODQ5NDk5YmM0ZWNlNmZmMDIwZjVm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">'ALERT: SECURITY BREACHES DETECTED - AMBER MOON SPIRE LEVELS 48 THROUGH 51'.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Yjk2ODYxMjY1MTRjZGJiMzgyYTVmOTIyNDBkNzM1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">'EVACUATION PROTOCOLS INITIATED'.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NjZmZGEzM2ViMzQ5NzA4ZWQwYzJhNDFmNTNkY2I2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The holographic displays shattered into fragments of data, emergency protocols overriding their careful analysis. Through the chaos of alerts, a new warning flashed:</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YmRjZjYyN2Y2YjQzMThiMDljNDM3NDRmNDhjMzA1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">'CONTAINMENT BREACH RISK: SUBJECT S CHAMBER SHOWING UNUSUAL READINGS'.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMDFlYTBjNGJlMTRiNmU5NGM3OTZmZjUxYWVkY2E5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">'PSIONIC DAMPENERS AT 82% AND FALLING'.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NjY2MTliNmJmNTQ4NDU5NTIxMjhmM2M1M2VkNzc4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Dinu," Shao's voice cut through the cacophony of alarms, his hologram now the only stable projection in the chamber, "it seems your theories about resource allocation are being tested sooner than expected."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YzYzYjAyMDU1NjQ0ZmE4MTZlNzdjMjU5ZGZiYWM4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur's hands moved through the scattered data streams, reconstructing the Spire's security grid. "Multiple breach points... but the pattern is wrong. This is..."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ODdiMTA1Mjc4YTQ0MzRhOTRkZGUzMzNmNGFjMjNl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"A coordinated assault, milady," Cheng Wei finished, his red armor reflecting the pulsing emergency lights.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMDBhMGY3OTBhMjQzNmE5MGJjODdjN2Q1MmY2N2U1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Thankfully away from the Main Server Room, where Crystal's data sits," Dilinur's fingers tightened on her hairpin.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNzk5NThiNDlmNTQyMGY4NGEyOTNkZjliYzE0MWI1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Shazmeen was already moving, her golden-threaded robes catching the red emergency lights like flames. "I'll contact ZenFusion security. The android and her programmer can wait."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOGY0Nzg4NThjOTQzZTBhMmUxNDM5ZjA1OWY0M2Rh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur straightened.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMWQ1NWQyY2E4NTRkMzk4Y2UyMmE4M2RmNDE1Njg2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Governor, with your permission, I'll contain the situation." She met his gaze steadily, knowing her next assignment – perhaps her very survival – depended on these precious seconds.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTM2NDA4MmI5MTRlNmZiOThiN2VjYzQxMDFjYTUx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Very well," he said finally. "Do not fail me."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NjEzNzVjMWUyYjRkMTJiZDg2MWM3NWQyZTc1Yzg3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The hologram vanished, leaving the chamber awash in red warning lights. Dilinur turned to her subordinates.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YjgyNzllNDc2ODQyY2RhN2ZmZjg1NDYwYzhlNDgw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Cheng, oversee U6-M9's transfer. Shazmeen, coordinate with Spire security. Tell them my Bloodtroopers will be there," Her gaze swept the chamber of wide-eyed officials. "The rest of you, clear the building."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMjBmMDA3Yjg2ZDRmMTY5M2FkNGRiZDkyODgxMmQ0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">But she left the real threat unspoken. They all knew what Subject S was capable of.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOWE0MWNlYmI3NDRkOTViNDE3OWQ2MzVhNTZiMmM1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The dragons on her robe caught fire in the morning sun as she stepped out. Behind her, the alarms continued their urgent song, </span>calling her toward the chaos.</p>
