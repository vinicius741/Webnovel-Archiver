# Progress Report: Robust Story Identification Architecture

This report summarizes the progress made on the "Robust Story Identification Architecture" development plan and outlines the remaining tasks.

## Current Progress

### Phase 0: Legacy Migration and Index Creation (Completed)

*   **Task 0.1: Design the Migration Trigger Logic:**
    *   **Status:** Completed.
    *   **Details:** The `trigger_migration_if_needed()` function is implemented in `webnovel_archiver/cli/main.py`, ensuring the migration process is initiated automatically on application startup if `index.json` does not exist.
*   **Task 0.2: Implement the Core Migration Script:**
    *   **Status:** Completed.
    *   **Details:** The `migrate_legacy_archive()` function in `webnovel_archiver/cli/migration.py` has been implemented. It scans existing `archival_status` folders, extracts story URLs, derives permanent IDs using fetchers, and populates `index.json` with `permanent-id: folder-name` mappings.
*   **Task 0.3: Implement Robust Error Handling and Logging for Migration:**
    *   **Status:** Completed.
    *   **Details:** A dedicated `migration.log` has been set up using `webnovel_archiver/utils/logger.py`. The migration script now includes robust error handling for scenarios like corrupt `progress.json` files, missing URLs, and failed ID extraction, logging warnings and errors to the new log file.

### Phase 1: Core Logic and Command Integration (Completed)

*   **Task 1.1: Refactor the Main Archiving Logic:**
    *   **Status:** Completed.
    *   **Details:** The `archive_story()` function in `webnovel_archiver/core/orchestrator.py` has been refactored. It now loads `index.json` to look up existing stories by their permanent ID. If a story is found, it uses the mapped folder name for all file operations. For new stories, it generates a folder name based on the permanent ID and adds an entry to `index.json`.
*   **Task 1.2: Adapt `archiver generate-report`:**
    *   **Status:** Completed.
    *   **Details:** The `main()` function in `webnovel_archiver/generate_report.py` has been updated to read `index.json` as the primary source for discovering stories. The generated report now correctly reflects stories based on the index and can include the permanent ID.
*   **Task 1.3: Adapt `archiver cloud-backup`:**
    *   **Status:** Completed.
    *   **Details:** The `cloud_backup_handler()` in `webnovel_archiver/cli/handlers.py` has been modified to use `index.json` for identifying stories to back up. It now uses the permanent ID as the name for the story's folder in the cloud storage, ensuring consistency regardless of local folder names.

## Remaining Tasks

### Phase 2: Activating Folder Synchronization

*   **Task 2.1: Implement Folder Renaming and Index Update:**
    *   **Description:** This task involves enhancing the main archiving workflow (`archive_story` in `orchestrator.py`). After identifying a story via its permanent ID, the system needs to fetch the latest metadata, generate a new "slug" from the current title, and compare it to the folder name currently stored in `index.json`. If these differ, the system must safely rename the story's folder on the filesystem and atomically update the corresponding entry in `index.json` with the new folder name. This ensures local folder names stay synchronized with the story's current title while maintaining the stable permanent ID.
*   **Task 2.2: Refactor New Story Creation:**
    *   **Description:** While Phase 1.1 laid the groundwork, this task focuses explicitly on ensuring that when a *new* story is archived for the first time, its local folder is created using the permanent ID-based naming convention, and this creation is seamlessly integrated with adding the entry to `index.json` as a single, cohesive, and robust operation.

### Phase 3: Finalization and Code Cleanup

*   **Task 3.1: Remove `generate_story_id`:**
    *   **Description:** The legacy `generate_story_id` function (which generated IDs based on titles) and all its call sites must be completely removed from the codebase. This task should only be performed after Phase 2 is fully implemented and thoroughly tested, as `generate_story_id` currently serves as a fallback. Its removal signifies the full transition to the robust, permanent ID-based system.

**Next Step:** I am ready to proceed with Phase 2. Please confirm when you are ready for me to start.
