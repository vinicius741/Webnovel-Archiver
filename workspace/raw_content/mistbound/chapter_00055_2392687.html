<p class="cnNlMGQ4ZGZlZmMyZDQ3MjhhNDdiMDlmYzc1ZjU0MDNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn’s formation paid off; they were attacked by assassins twice on their way to the airfield. The first came from behind, but he was easily taken down by Terrance with a vicious counter-strike that left the assailant bleeding out on the street. The second tried an aerial assault, trying to leap into the middle of the formation from a roof, only to be spotted from a distance by Keith, who was flying a few meters above the rest of them for that exact purpose. Terrance took care of that one too, silently breaking off from the group and using </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Spider Climb </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">to come up behind him. One backstab later, Terrance rejoined the team. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyMjZlZDJkNGJiMjRhNmJiMDlmZGJmNGIwZTUyMDY1"><span style="font-weight: 400">By far, Peter was struggling the most with dealing with the attacks, though Frankie wasn’t far behind. Neither were at all accustomed to battle, and Peter looked positively green when he heard the wet crunch of Terrance’s dagger slamming into an assassin’s chest and the awful scrape of metal against ribs. The coppery smell of blood spilling had very nearly sent him over the edge, but he’d somehow managed. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2MWNlOTg4NzkxZjQyOTBiM2IyNjExNWVhNjIxN2Rl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Frankie simply looked away, looking deathly pale and muttering quietly to herself, trying to gauge how much further they were from the airfield. Dan and Ernesto weren’t entirely unaffected, both grimacing in distaste, but they seemed able to deal with it, their histories giving them enough exposure to dead bodies that they could keep moving. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzMmMwNzc1N2VhZjQxNGVhNDU4MWQwYzMxZGI4NTRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The ZRC’s getting desperate,” Terrance commented, pitching his voice just loud enough for the rest of the crew to hear him. “They must have caught word that the king and queen are going to take them out. Taking us out is their only chance of salvaging the situation. Without Dan and Ernesto to invert the necromantic mana, they would hold the final trump card, and the royal family wouldn’t have much choice but to give them whatever they wanted.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlYmNjODk3NTY4YzRiMTNhZjQ1YWUxNWE1MzkwYTE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn grunted in acknowledgment, scanning the road ahead. They weren’t far from the airfield now - maybe another fifteen minutes’ brisk walk. “Then we should be prepared for a final stand at the airfield. As soon as we leave Zephyr, we’ll be out of their reach. Ernesto, how’re you doing? That </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vitality Boost </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">doing its job?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMxOWRkNGU0ODI1NzRhNzhhYzhmYTU4NDI1ZjhiMjk2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m feeling better already, though I’m a little hungry now,” he confirmed with a nod to Maeryn. “And thanks to Keith, I’ve got a long-range option. I’m ready when you are. Just give the word.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZGRjY2MzZWZjOTQxYmViY2VmYzFmYjRjYzU4NDE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We should probably expect more necromancers there, too,” Dan pointed out. “We really should have a battle plan in case we see more Undead there.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNkODEyMjM1MmVkMDQ4ZmRiYjM3NTlhMWU1N2ExNjc4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seriously, where are they getting all these necromancers?” Frankie muttered, her voice tinged with frustration as she shook her head in disbelief. “Weren’t they all supposed to be killed on discovery? No offense, Ernesto.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM1NTdhNjJmYmUzNjQ4MWE4YjgyMjI4YjdlYjI3ZGQ2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No offense taken. I get what you mean.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM2N2FiMDYxYmM4MzQzODNiZGJiM2YzOTU4MjQwZTQ2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Peter shook his head. “The ZRC’s been responsible for identifying and killing them for a long time. I guess they’ve just been identifying and secretly training them, instead.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZTdlZWFlNzljOTQxYzhiNGVkNDgzYTRkYmQyNWZm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That would explain why they captured Ernesto instead of killing him at the hotel,” Terrance mused thoughtfully. “It’d be stupid to ask him to switch sides if they killed his friends in front of him.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM2YzY0ODBiN2YxMzQxMDk5OWIzNDQ1NjM1ZmIwOGU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We can speculate about motivations later. Focus!” Maeryn barked, forcefully pulling everyone back on track. Her team immediately fell silent, listening intently. “Battle plan time. If we see both Undead and necromancers, here’s how we play it. Frankie, Dan, Peter, you stay out of it and find cover, though I wouldn’t mind if you start hurling alchemical fire at things. Ernesto, find cover and use your long range option, whatever it is, on the necromancers. Use </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Command Undead </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">as you see fit. Keith, you harass the necromancers with your cold attacks. I’ll keep the Undead busy and kill what I can using blades and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Fireball</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Terrance, you stab the necromancers.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3MGQzYzI4MmRhNjRiNjJiMzk0ZGQwOTZhNzVmNWVh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What, no fancy maneuvers for me?” the rogue joked. “Just, ‘Terrance, stab’?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5Y2Y0OTFhMjgyZDRhNDRhMmFmMDFjMTc1MmU4ZWIy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, if you feel like being </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">fancy</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, I’m sure you can figure something out.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZTlmYTJjN2YzYTQyM2M5MDY1NGVlYzg1MzFmNjFh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Frankie groaned, rolling her eyes. “Will you two quit flirting already?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMmRiYTJhNTI2NjQ0MWRiNjVmMWNiY2ZiMjkwNjVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’re not flirting!” Terrance and Maeryn protested simultaneously. The brief silence that followed was almost tangible. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwZjc2OGU0MDViMTRiMTc4ZGY3M2RhZTY3NjQxNzdh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn cut through it, absolutely refusing to blush. “Moving on! Any questions, suggestions? Specifically about the battle plan?” She got a round of negative responses. “Right then. Be ready for anything. Let’s move.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmZjA5NTg2ZTQ5MjRhNjdhOTM5NjVlNjE4M2ZlMzg0"><span style="font-weight: 400">The seven of them moved quickly but carefully, watching intently for any more threats. For better or for worse, the streets were empty by now; the repeated assassination attempts had long since scattered the populace, sending them fleeing into any shelter that would take them. It made identifying threats easier, but it also meant they had no cover. Each footstep echoed softly off the buildings around them, leaving each living member of the party tense as they made their way to the airfield. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjMTNmOTIyMWFjMTQwN2Q5ZWNjNDZiZWQyNTg3ZWM2"><span style="font-weight: 400">They rounded the final corner, and Maeryn’s eyes scanned the airfield. Sure enough, there was Stonewing. It looked like it’d only just been brought out from the warehouse it’d been stored in. Which meant… yep. Just as she’d expected, the propellers were still removed, which was clear even from this distance. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxMGQ2OWRkMjVkNzQ5ZDNiNzdiMDg0OWI2ODRkMzQx"><span style="font-weight: 400">More striking, however, was the team of five young-looking necromancers and twenty Undead corpses standing between Maeryn and the airship. “Peter? Frankie? Minor change of plans. When we engage, get to the warehouse, get those propellers while we take care of business. Move fast; we don’t know if there’ll be reinforcements.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjYzBlOTk3OTEwYTRhNDViOWM2ZjkyMDcxMGUwZmIx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Captain,” the two of them acknowledged, tensing. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTQ5ZTQzZTA0YTRhNjVhMGFmOTBiMjA5ZTM5ZjUy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn gave them the tiniest nod before returning her attention to the necromancers. “You don’t want to do this, you know,” she called out, trying her best to sound completely confident and nonchalant. “We’ve already had to kill too many of your colleagues today. Don’t make us add you to the list.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhNjMwOTRjM2FmOTQ3NjlhMDIwZDNiYjdkMzlmMmQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s too late!” one of the necromancers shouted back angrily. “What are we supposed to do, lie down and die? Either we kill you and the ZRC protects us, or you get away and the king kills us! We never had a choice in this!” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwNzEwNzgwZTU5MzRmOTM4NTVlNjkxYmY3Njg1ZTRl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s not like we wanted to have this necromantic affinity when we were kids!” another one shouted, his face twisting in despair even as his voice wavered uncertainly. “We’re just doing what we have to do! You understand that, right? You understand that the law isn’t fair! The ZRC… the ZRC promised that we’d be okay! That we’d be the ones that Zephyria would have to rely on!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyODkwZTFmMDQ4NTQwMGFiZDgzYjJkNGQwYmMxNjAz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We just needed to wait… Just a little bit longer…!” a third joined in, his voice anguished. “Just until the cities were forced to land in the Mist! And then we could use the Mist to empower ourselves and protect everyone! We’d be the saviors of Zephyria! They wouldn’t dare kill us then! But you… you’ve ruined everything!” </span></p>
<p class="cnMxNzhkYjlhMmY0YjRkOWVhZTJjMzc0NWYwZjA0Mjk1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, what, I was supposed to be the one to lie down and die?” Maeryn countered, purposely using their own words against them. “My whole people were supposed to lie down and die, for you to feel safe?” She ripped off her Zephyrian airship jacket, flinging it to the side. “I’m a Geovan, and proud of it! And your plan would have meant killing my entire nation! My parents! My friends! Everyone I knew and loved!” </span></p>
<p class="cnMxYzEwNjEzZWY4ZjQ0YmFhYzhkY2VlYTE0OTY2NDIy"><span style="font-weight: 400">As Maeryn spoke, the wind tugged at her hair, her eyes blazing with conviction. The necromancers shifted uneasily, their robes rustling as they exchanged uncertain glances. The Undead standing between the necromancers and Maeryn’s team stood eerily still, their hollow eyes locked onto the living. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlMjc4YzA3NDgyNzRjODFhMzQ1ODhiNDNkZWIyOTA4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Besides,” Maeryn continued, pointing at Ernesto, “as soon as I explained things to the king, he authorized my crew to practice necromancy in order to save Zephyria! Did the ZRC never think to talk things through, or did they just want power for its own sake? Don’t you see? They’re using you!” </span></p>
<p class="cnMxNTg4ZWZhOTUyNjQxZjA4ZjdjMmU2NDU3MTA0ZGNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So what?!” the third one howled. “We would have died without them showing us mercy! We owe them everything! I don’t care if I’m used, so long as they don’t throw me away! </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Command Undead!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmM2MwYmJkOGE5NDRjMDJhNTczOTY2Y2IwZWI3YWU5"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Undead began to surge forward, the living corpses lunging with unnatural grace and strength. In response, Maeryn’s team leapt into action according to the plan they’d set. Frankie and Peter broke into a run towards the warehouses, Terrance took off at an angle to circle around the Undead, and Dan and Ernesto darted for cover behind a nearby wall. Maeryn flashed some mana into her vambraces, extending the blades, and flipped her hand up, flame manifesting from nothing and swirling, compressing into an orb in front of her palm. “</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Fireball!” </span></em></p>
<p class="cnM1N2Y3MzY4YzM3YjRiNjU5NjYzMzE2MzI0OGQ4YzA1"><span style="font-weight: 400">The fiery orb launched forward and slammed into the chest of one of the Undead with an explosive </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">whump</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, quickly setting it and the two companions on either side alight. A second later, three more Undead were set aflame by a second Fireball courtesy of Maeryn’s other hand. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1Zjk5ZmE1NWExMDQ1NDFiZmYwNWViYTY3YmY0ZmI5"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fireball! Fireball! Fireball!” </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn cast repeatedly, sweat dripping down her brow as she struggled to suck in enough ambient mana to power the spell. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0NTU5MzliMTIyYjRkY2ViYTA1Zjk1OTQ5YTcxMzc3"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">“Cone of Cold!” </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">one of the necromancers retaliated, aiming for the Undead. A biting gust of frost shot forth, instantly snuffing out the flames and encasing the charred corpses in a thin layer of ice. The sudden drop in temperature made the air crackle, yet the frozen Undead continued their relentless advance, the frost only adding to their otherworldly menace. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlMDFhNzg2ZGUzNDQ0M2ZiYzNkYzhmYWVkMDNlYTg1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn abandoned any further attempts at fire magic, instead preparing herself for melee combat. “</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Body Enhancement!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” she spat, allowing what dregs of mana she could find to empower her. “Ernesto! Do it!” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiOTc3YmRiZTA5MDRiZGU4OTlhNDY0OWQ5NmRiODQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">On cue, Ernesto threw himself out of cover and pointed at the necromancer who had started the fight. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">“Necrotic Ray!” </span></em></p>
<p class="cnNlNjc5ZGU1NjE5ODRjZjNiZmI1YTg1ZGQzMzJiNzkz"><span style="font-weight: 400">The man in question was about to leap out of the way when Keith materialized behind him, his spectral hands gripping the man’s neck with an icy vice. The necromancer's scream echoed through the air as his skin turned an unnatural shade of blue from the frostbite. But his suffering wasn’t for long; Ernesto’s Necrotic Ray struck true, hitting the necromancer squarely in the chest. The scream abruptly cut off as the necromancer fell limp, Keith’s grip releasing as the man crumpled to the ground, lifeless.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZmIyZTk0OTBhODQ1NDFhZDg3NjFjZDU2MDc1MWZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">The other necromancers recoiled in fear as Keith turned his unnatural gaze upon them. Without a word, Keith vanished from sight, turning invisible once again. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2MjAwZTM0MGM3NjQ2OTlhN2U3MjJmYTMxZmIxNDc0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kevin! Blighted Night, they killed Kevin!” one of the necromancers screamed in horror.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYWYwZjRhMTIzNTQxOWNhNGEwYmZhOWI1OTY2ZGZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You bastards!” </span></p>
<p class="cnNkNzBlNmVkNTgxNDRlZGQ4ODE1YmFiNGRiOWRiMzMw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“To be fair,” Terrance interrupted casually, thrusting a dagger into the spine of a different necromancer. The man let out pained, terrified gasp as he crumpled to the ground, blood immediately pooling underneath him. “You are trying to kill us.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwOWU1NzRmNDhjMjQ3Mzc4OTFmODI2YTgwNzRmMzU5"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">“Command Undead!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” Ernesto shouted, taking advantage of the opportunity to wrest control of the Undead horde. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlZmYyNjg5NDM5NjQyMjk5MmEwM2NmMmU0Y2I0MGQ3"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">“Command… </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Blight! Stay away from me!</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">” </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">The necromancer that had tried to counter Ernesto had to abandon the attempt as soon as Terrance darted towards him, backpedaling furiously. “</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Chilling Touch!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlYmEwYTA4NzkwMzQ0ODViZWIxNjEyOTk3ZDRjOTQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh no, I’m not being hit by that again,” Terrance swore, watching the magic-coated hands sharply as he kept his distance. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzZWFkN2Y5ZWYzZDQxZmRiY2MzOWNkNDE5NDk3YTJk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Allow me,” Keith’s voice suggested darkly, materializing in front of Terrance and floating right through the hands of the necromancer. The living man shrieked in surprise and pain as his spell backfired, and bloody shards of ice erupted out of his hands. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTI4ZjRjYTNmYTQzOGRiYTM4NTFhMjU1YjlmMjkz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Many thanks,” Terrance told the ghost appreciatively, swooping in from the side to finish the job with a quick stab through the necromancer’s neck before moving on.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTlkYzc5OWY0OTQ4NTk4YzExODdlM2Y5MDBkZTA1"><span style="font-weight: 400">The final two necromancers quickly raised their arms up, obviously casting their trump cards. “</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Necro Aura of Cold!”</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p class="cnMzM2FhM2EzMzA3YTQ1NDA5ZWMxM2UzYjZmMjY2ZDc5"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">“Necro Aura of Decay!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyODEyMGZhYTk2NTQxNjRhZjQ2N2EzZTJkYmZlZGQz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Two translucent globes emerged from around them, the first an icy blue, the second a blue-gray tint. The range seemed to be about three meters - more than enough to earn some distance from Terrance as he took a cautious step back. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwYTM2NDNhMzdkNDQzYTQ4NThiMjFlODQ4MThkYzdm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Our aura spells overlap and magnify each other, bastard,” one of the necromancers hissed. “You’ll freeze and rot to death before you get close enough to stab us. So back off!” </span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTgyNjk0MWU5YzRkY2I4ZmQ5YjVmZDk0N2QzOGM5"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">“Banish Spirit!” </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">the second one added, pointing at Keith. The ghost vanished with a startled yelp, and Terrance could tell from the feel of the air and mana around him that Keith was, in fact, gone for now. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZWY2MTE2NmRhOTQ3YjRiYzE4YmJiNDY1ZTdlZGE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maeryn? Now what?” Terrance asked nervously. “I can’t get close, and they’ve got ranged spells.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzMDZjNjFlYTEzZDRlYzNiY2I1NzUwOGQ3OWMxN2E4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now?” Maeryn’s voice was icy. “Now we give them a taste of their own medicine. Ernesto? Feed ‘em to the Undead.” </span></p><span class="cjlhYjY0MGMyMTcyZTRlMGRhYzkwNWFmOWM4OTZiMmFm"><br/>Love this story?

<p class="cnNmMThhMzU3ZGM2NzQwY2ZhZmZlNGJmMDA5OGMxZmU5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto paled. “Are… are you sure, Maeryn?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNkYzcyYjZkOGYyNjQ0NGM5YzA4YzhlMTFmMzEzN2Nm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Unless you have a better idea.” Maeryn’s voice was hard as granite, unyielding. “They’re trying to kill us, and we have this handy force of cold-proof, rot-proof Undead that they’ve been so generous to give us. Either we use them, or those guys play target practice with us.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlODYxY2Y5ZmQxMTQ5NTViMjU3MWI2M2MyZWQ0MTAy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, no, we’re not gonna let that happen. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Command Undead!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjYjZlMjAyMzEyODQ5OTBiZDU5ZjE5ZDkwN2ZkZGVm"><span style="font-weight: 400">As the Undead horde turned back on Maeryn and her team, she scowled fiercely. “Can’t get close… and I don’t think my </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Fireball</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> will do much with their cold auras! Any suggestions before we get eaten?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM2Y2IwNzk5NGY0YjRjMTQ4MDc3MTQ2NTg4YTNkOTEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have one!” Ernesto called out. “I just need a minute of time!” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZDJmMmUxNTcxMzQ0NTNhYjdkY2YwYjFkNGUxM2Q0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just one minute? I think we can give you that much.” Terrance ran in to stand beside Maeryn. “I’ve got your back. Let’s dismember these Undead.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZGJlOTM0MDVkNzQ3ZmM5YjE2NGRiMTg4OWRhMmY2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s like you read my mind.” The two of them kicked off the ground, circling the Undead in opposite directions, working to take targets of opportunity. The air quickly grew foul and disgusting as Undead limbs fell to the ground, spilling black malodorous ichor that turned Maeryn’s stomach, but she couldn’t afford to pay attention to that. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTNjZTQ1N2ZhNzQwZjNiZjRkNjBjNTQ5NTNkNzU0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, Ernesto was busy muttering to himself, hiding behind a wall. “Come on, come on…! Necromancy has </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Cold, Rot, Acid, Spirit, Undead. </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">What are the opposites? Opposite of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Cold </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">is </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Heat</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, obviously. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Rot? </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">No, wait, Keith told me that </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Rot’s </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">true nature was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Time. </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">I bet </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Acid’s </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">like that too. They’re both about breaking stuff down, accelerating the flow of time. So the opposite would be… time reversal? Call it </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Restoration</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, then. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Spirit, Spirit…!” </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto clutched his head tightly. “All the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Spirit </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">spells are about exploration, and communication… but they happen by manipulating the body-spirit link. Even summoning ghosts just makes, like, a mana-body for the ghost to inhabit. So, so, the opposite would be… safeguarding it? Protecting it? </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Protection</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> then. And… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Undead… </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">What’s the opposite of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Undead?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMjQ1YmI5ZjFiNjQwNzRhM2MzNmJiZjkzMmEzM2Ri"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto’s breathing grew more shallow and quick as he struggled to finish putting the pieces together. Then, inexplicably, he thought about his Master. Research Master Graves. And about Keith Laurant, the Undead Necromancer. Inspiration filled him. “The Undead are both alive and dead at the same time. That’s why they make the Mist. Dan figured that much out. But it’s not natural to be alive and dead at once. It’s a cycle. It’s always been a cycle. Life begets death, death begets life, it’s supposed to be a harmony! The opposite of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Undeath </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">is both </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Life </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Death</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">! It’s… the nature of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Mortality</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">!” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlNTc0OTljYmM1YTQzNGRhODQ4OGI0YzVhYWI3YWY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">For a few seconds, Ernesto was in awe at his own revelation, but he shook his head rapidly. “No time to be impressed with myself! Focus, Ernesto! Channel your mana, imbue the concepts, and hope you get it right!” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhNjUwMmNjNDNjZTRlZGI4YTkwYjNlMjhiNjMxODVk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Almost done back there?!” Terrance asked, sounding simultaneously exhausted and anxious. He’d exerted himself physically really hard today, and he was just about out of energy. And there were still a dozen Undead left over. A quick glance at Maeryn showed that she too was flagging, her movements no longer as smooth as they had been. “Ernesto!” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmMjI1NDZlOTdiYTQ1Yzk4M2I4OGJiMDEyNmMyY2Ey"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Done! Catch!” Ernesto flung a stone tablet towards Terrance, and the noble caught it easily. “It’s enchanted! You should be able to get through the necromantic auras now!” </span></p>
<p class="cnM2MWRiYmE2MTNkZDQzYjRhYjViYjdlNGRmOTE5MTNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance didn’t bother to reply, instead turning on his heel and dashing right at the two necromancers, who were starting to look a little nervous. Terrance’s heart pounded wildly in his chest as he ran; if Ernesto’s trinket didn’t work, he’d be frozen over and rotting in seconds, but he had no choice but to trust the necromancer now. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxZmU3ZWI4ZGEwNzRjZTM4OGVlM2Q2OWM2OGI1NDZh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Miraculously, the tablet worked. Terrance could feel the mana try to take hold, but it just… slid off of him, scattered by the stone tablet that he held with one hand. He smiled grimly as he got within arm’s reach of the two remaining necromancers, who looked completely stunned. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyOWE3ZWE3Mjk2NzQ3ZTE5OGZiODhmZWRiYTgyNmE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">As he raised his dagger, ready to end two more lives, both of the necromancers put their hands up and dropped their aura spells entirely. “We surrender!” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiZWYyYmNlMjQ1ZTRjYjA5ODA5NDMyNWE4NTM4NDQ4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance halted his movements right as his dagger reached the throat of one of the two necromancers. “Maeryn! What am I doing?!” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjNTFhN2VjZDA5YzQ0ODhhNDY0YTBmZjVlMTFiMzUz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ernesto!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Y2I4ZWEyMjY2NjQ3ZTJiZWJmZGVkMTkyNGIyZjdl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“On it! </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Command Undead!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” The remaining Undead halted immediately in their tracks, and Maeryn slumped slightly as she turned to see Terance’s position, ready to finish the job. “I don’t see a reason to keep them alive, do you?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZDU5N2RiZTBjNzRlMTM4YjIzZjBlMzcwZjQzODg1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“They did surrender,” Terrance pointed out. He edged the dagger a few millimeters closer. “But to be honest, I don’t really see a reason either. Just figured I’d give you the chance.”  </span></p>
<p class="cnM1Y2ZhYjdhMjQ1ZDQ1NmRhMjRjMjY5MzM3Y2EzZTY4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“H-Hey now,” one of the necromancers stammered, clearly caught off guard. He glanced nervously at his companion. “Maybe we can talk about this?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzMDJkZGVhZTRkZjRmYjRiZGNmMDc1ZGVjZDUyZjJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Funny how you want to talk </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">after </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">we’ve killed half of you and beat your trump card,” Maeryn commented dryly, folding her arms and narrowing her eyes. “But sure. Why not? Tell me why I should let you live.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlMzQ2MmE4Y2FhZTQ5NmJiZGVmZDhkMjgwNzUzNTg5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’re not the ones who started the fight! That was Kevin!” one of them blurted. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmOWZmNjcwMjE5MTQwN2Q4ZmI1NTZkYzhhYzE2NTBk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Never liked him anyway,” the second necromancer muttered. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjMjFjOTU4OGZiMzRhMjVhMzljZDk2NzA5OTE5ODBm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A-anyway, we didn’t want to do this in the first place! And you, um, made some good points, earlier? About us being hypocrites, expecting Geovans to just die without trying to do something about it?” The first necromancer winced, his voice wavering. “Anyway, I’m thinking… you said the king authorized your crew to practice necromancy, right? W-W-What if… what if we joined your crew? Then we’d be safe, and we’d have no reason to betray you!” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyYzU2ZmNiMmJjMzRlZDJiZTU0NTFkM2QwZTUxNjhj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’d tell you whatever you wanted, about the ZRC,” necromancer number two added, seeing Maeryn’s skeptical expression. “And, and, you said you needed inverted necromantic mana, right? That means you need necromancers! You’ve only got one, you’ll want more of us so you don’t overwork him! And I’m a fair hand at runes, I can help!” </span></p>
<p class="cnNkYmFlOGU5YWQ0ZjRiMzA5MGVmNmQ2NDkyNTNmZGYx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn did her best not to react to that statement. He had a point. They could certainly use more assistance when it came down to it. Especially since Dan and Ernesto were awfully close to being able to try their proof of concept; any bit of manpower would be invaluable for creating and powering the runic tools needed to save everyone. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjOTBiMTE4MzkwZDQ4M2I5NzE4ODY1NDBkYWY4OGIz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn took a deep breath and met their eyes with a steely gaze. “Congratulations. You’ve successfully bought your lives. Terrance, if either of them so much as twitches badly, stab them both.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NTA0NzQ1OGUwODQ3OTY4YTBiNDk3ODkzMGNkYWY1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aye-aye, Captain.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDJmOWVjNGZhNzRjN2JhZDk1ZTdkMDE2ZmQwODI3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Captain?” Ernesto questioned uncertainly. “Are you sure about this? I mean, I’m not saying we should kill them, but…” He glanced at them. “They did try to kill us. How can you trust them?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMxZDNiNzljNTczMzRhYzQ5ZDdkNjMzN2I2Mjk5MmVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, I don’t,” Maeryn clarified, watching as the Terrance slowly lowered his dagger and caught his breath. The necromancers were careful to make no moves that could be interpreted as aggressive. “But like they said. We could use the extra hands. They’ll be under watch while we’re on Stonewing</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">and the minute we touch down again I think I’ll hand them over to the king. He’ll make the final decision, but I think that he’d appreciate having a ready workforce for when we have something ready for him.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjOTIzMjIwM2Q4NjQxZGViZGY4NmI3YWRkNzVhYmYw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto nodded, apparently satisfied by her explanation. With a frown of concentration, the Undead grouped themselves tightly. “Ready for you to Fireball.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0YzliYjk1ODdhZTRlODc4MmVlMTg0Mjc4YjhjYWEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Excellent work. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Fireball.</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” It only took a couple more iterations for all of the Undead to be reduced to ash, and Maeryn slowly relaxed as the abominations vanished without a trace.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OGFiMjlhMjg1MDQyODVhZGI1ZDZkYTZlMDBmMGU5"><span style="font-weight: 400">The sound of footsteps had her turning to see Peter and Frankie carrying the heavy-looking propellers, huffing a bit with exertion as they hurried to the airship. Maeryn gave them a nod as they immediately set to reattaching the propellers, then frowned as the three necromancer corpses caught her eye. “What do we do with those…?” she wondered softly. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhZTY5N2JmMmM1MDQ1Zjg4NTc3M2U0M2ZmMDA4YzY4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We probably shouldn’t leave them lying around,” Terrance agreed, seeing where she was looking. “Then again, the local authorities could probably deal with it. It’s not like the king and queen don’t know that the ZRC was out to kill us.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNkOTBhZGNiZGFhNDQ3Y2I5OWFlY2I0OTY1MDdmN2Q4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Only three real options, I think,” Dan said softly. He’d come out from hiding a minute ago and had slowly walked over, only now reaching earshot. “We leave them be and let the locals deal with them. We toss them off the flying city and let whatever’s on the ground eat them. Or…” he swallowed uncomfortably. “Or we use the bodies as… practice? Ernesto does need to learn </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Raise Undead </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">at some point. Let him raise them now, then we burn the Undead, and the bodies are gone.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMTdhYmQ0NDYxMjQ2MTI5MmNlYjFjODhmMmNkZGE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait. Your necromancer doesn’t know how to raise the dead yet?” one of their prisoners asked disbelievingly before turning to look at Ernesto. “What have you even been doing with your necromancy?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlMzA0MTY5NGQ1YjQ1YjQ4NDc4OWI3ZDA1MjMxM2Jk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto sighed, already able to tell how the rest of the conversation was going to go. “I make cheese.”  </span></p>
<p class="cnNhZWY0ZDFiZDM0NzQxMzg4MzQ4ZTFjZjgzZjdlMDBm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You make… cheese?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM2OTA5ZmI2NjliYzQ5NzhhOThkYWVkNmE4MmQ1OTNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“YES! I make cheese! By the four winds, I’m so sick of people being surprised by this!” Ernesto exploded in sheer exasperation. “Cheese is made by fermenting dairy! Fermenting is rotting, and necro mana’s good at that! It’s not a difficult concept!” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiMmYyYjMwMDFlZTQwOTVhOTI3ZWRkOWNlOWQ0Nzhh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan snickered. “Cheese as a necromantic mana concept. That’s hilarious.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyMzY5ZDkwZTA3YTQzODc5NjllOGU1N2Y3NjdiZjgx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know, I don’t think I ever tried any of your cheese?” Terrance observed absently. “I don’t suppose you’d let me try some after we’re up in the air?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhYTc5MDg1Nzg1YjRmNzI4MTkzMDJmMTY5Y2U4Y2Rk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s… you’re the first person who’s ever asked, actually,” Ernesto told him, genuinely touched. “I’d be happy to.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjMzNDFmMzE0OTRiNTBhYTI5NjI3NGI0M2Q5MGUw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“People, can we focus? What’re we doing with the dead bodies?” Maeryn pointed out, suddenly feeling the weight of exhaustion hit her. It’d been a very long day. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlY2VkZjAzNDUzNzQ1M2Q5MGIyZTNiNTdjNDc1N2Vl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto looked conflicted, before sighing. “I’m… not ready to raise any Undead. Not yet. But it doesn’t make sense to waste the bodies, either. Captain… Can we, I don’t know, put them in storage? At least for now? I… I need to prepare myself for it.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZTE0YTYyNTMzYTRhNzliNzFjNjgyMDRlMzJiNzJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn nodded slowly, understanding Ernesto’s hesitation. It was a lot to ask him to raise the bodies right here and now, especially considering his Master’s death by his own Undead. She didn’t want to hurry him through his trauma if it could be avoided; not after what had happened with Terrance. “I’ll ask Frankie if there’s a suitable location on the airship. If there’s not, we’ll just leave them here.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlNzQ1Mjg4NmYwNjQyODA5YTYwYWUwYjMzNDUyMjk5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto nodded, relief washing across his face.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYjIxNTI4N2QzOTRmYWVhZmYyNmEwZGQ2Yzc4Yzg4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone watched Peter and Frankie hard at work getting the propellers exactly where they needed to be. “So, um… introductions?” one of the necromancers offered as the air grew awkward. “Since we’re going to be working together? I’m Owen.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OTk4MmZlZGVhZjRlMGJiNTQ5YzIyNTNiY2E5OTZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oscar,” the second necromancer said simply. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmMGFiNWY5YzcxYTQxYzJiZDQ0MzcwNGQ0YzFiOGVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn quickly introduced her crew in response, and everyone fell silent again. She glanced back at the airfield entrance, feeling a shiver run down her spine. The emptiness of the giant airfield unnerved her, but she knew it wouldn’t last for long. “You guys didn’t kill all the workers here to raise those Undead, did you?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MGMwMzZmNWNkZDRkMmQ5Y2RlYzdiYzk5OGVjMWQz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, of course not,” Owen rejected immediately. “The corpses we used were sourced from bodies donated to the ZRC. Not sure where they get ‘em, though…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMWY1MTE1YjliODQyOGE4Njg2N2U3ZjMwYzI3YmQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s a fund that the ZRC uses to pay people for donating the bodies of their families in pursuit of science,” Oscar informed them matter-of-factly. “Which you’d know, Owen, if you paid attention in our briefings.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM4YmM0YzI2ODEyYTQ1MjBhNDVkZjU4OTdlYTI4OWEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Owen sighed wearily. “Oscar, I think you’re the only one who ever paid attention to all of those minor details.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhNDkwNTU3NDY1MDQ3YmY5YTM0MmQwYTZhMjJmNTAz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know, I couldn’t help but notice that every single necromancer who came after us today were guys?” Maeryn observed curiously. “Are there just no girls there or what?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZmFlOWJhZDMxNzQyMTg4NTI1NmM2ODFkZjU3YWRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, no, there are girl necromancers,” Owen replied easily. “But the ZRC had them slotted in for some other project. Very hush-hush, no idea what’s going on there.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZGFmZmZmNjNjOTQwNzI5ZjIyYTQ0ZTg3OWMzMGZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Oscar frowned, obviously lost in thought. “We didn’t get to see them very often. But I suppose it doesn’t matter. After the king tears through the ZRC, they’ll either be free or killed, and the truth will come out one way or another.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Y2I1MDNhNDcyMDRiNDU5MzZjNDE0NmU4NjY5MmJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess so,” Owen agreed softly. “Hard to believe how quickly it all came tumbling down.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyNGM2NzE1MGU1NjQ3MzI5YmJmYzRlYjAyOTVhNmIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Oscar hummed noncommittally, and quiet befell the group once more. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDM3MjY5NjExOTQ0MTViZWY2NjQ2Yzk0ZWMzMTAz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn checked the entrance to the airfield again. Still empty. “You know, I kind of expected you guys to have reinforcements on the way or something? We weren’t exactly quiet when we were fighting.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjY2Y3ZmE1NzA5MTRlNTZhOGJhZjBhZDU2NjhjY2Iw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nah. We were the last resort. The ZRC thought that there was no way you’d get past five of us working in concert with a bunch of Undead as shock troops.” Owen snorted derisively. “Shows what they know.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzNGEwY2U1ODM5NDQzNDliMTllNGNhMTZkNTAzZjZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you’d paid attention, Owen, then you’d know from the briefing that it wasn’t that the ZRC thought we couldn’t lose, it was that they had to divide up their forces,” Oscar corrected sharply. “They thought half of us here to stop Captain Maeryn was sufficient, while the other half of us were needed at the ZRC headquarters to cause chaos in the ranks of the royal guardsmen by using </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Raise Undead </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">on anyone who fell.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0NTM1ZWZmOWIwMjQ1MzliYzIyOTRiNGM2OTI5NGVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Owen groaned. “You’re literally just saying the same thing I am. I said they thought we’d be enough, you’re saying they thought we’d be enough.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NjQ1NTg3YzljMzRiNWU5MGIwNzY1NzQ2Y2NmOWVh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmph!” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhYzEyYzc5MTcwZTQ0YmFiNWFjOTQ5M2JiNmRhOTI0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn glanced at Terrance, who rolled his eyes. Yeah, she felt the same way. “Frankie! How’s it going?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkODNmZjU0MWE4ZjRkYjU5NzgxZDVlYzZmOWQ3YzNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Almost done, Captain! Just got one propeller to go!” </span></p>
<p class="cnM2MjQ4NzJjYmNjOTQ2MGJiZmUzNzNmNGFhM2I3ODNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good work! Take your time and do it right! Doesn’t sound like we’ll be interrupted anytime soon.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyOGU5Y2U0OTRmZTRlNzY5NzQ1ZjQyOTM3N2IwY2Ex"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Captain!” </span></p>
<p class="cnM4MjU1ODc0OGQ4NzQ1NmNhMDA5NmQxNzU4OGU3NzJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto glanced between Maeryn, Dan and Terrance. “Um… is anyone else thinking that maybe we should go help the royal guardsmen with the ZRC or something?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNTY2NThkNzYzNjQ1YTliMmRmYzU5YjIyYTc4MzMw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance shook his head emphatically. “No way! We do not want to get involved there. Those guys go through some serious training; they’ll finish things, no problem. We just need to focus on us.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZTAyYTA0MzkxOTQ3NTJiOWRkYmRmYzFlYjAwZGYy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn nodded in agreement. “I know it sounds selfish, but if you think about it, we’re doing the king a favor, getting out of his hair while he deals with this.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3NDk0MzNhNjM2MzQ4NGRhNjgwNmIyMjM1NDAxZWY3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto hummed thoughtfully, crossing his arms, neither agreeing nor disagreeing with Maeryn’s assessment. But he seemed willing to abide by it. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3NzgzMzBhNmUxYjQwMmY5YzVkMmMwNDFjYWUxMGY5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Ernesto? How did that tablet get me through their auras?” Terrance asked, suddenly curious. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5Y2YwNGFlZGVhMzQ3NzU4ODBlMmRhZGJlZDA5YTkw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh. Well. It’s probably not perfect, but… I was able to power Dan’s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Necro Resistance </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">rune sequence.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Nzc1MDkwOTNmOTRjZTdhYjUzZDcyMzU2NzYyZTRi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You what?” Dan gasped. “You inverted the necromantic mana?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNkN2U5YWRmMWQwZjRmNzU4Y2ZiMDA4ZTlkNDY3Mjcy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um… yes?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZWI4MGIxNjk2ZjQyNDViMjY5Y2JlYzFmZjNkNDgw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And it held up against both auras?” Dan pressed. “Two necromancers using both Necro Aura of Cold and Necro Aura of Decay? Terrance, you weren’t hurt were you?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNkMmY0ZjkyMTNjMjQ5YzFiM2NkOTRhNDkxZTA3ZGY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No.” Terrance shook his head. “Felt like the mana just slid off me.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OTk2MTZkOGRmNDRmYTE5YjU3YzJlYTI5NjVhMzUy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then… then…! Give me that tablet!” Dan practically seized it from Terrance and inspected it with wide, manic eyes. “It’s… it’s stable! Ernesto… You… Hold this, and cast a necromantic spell. Anything. Try all of your spells until something works.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNkN2JiZTUzY2IxYTQ0YmVhYzQ2NmZmOTM3MjMwNmY2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um… sure.” Ernesto took it in his hands and tried to cast </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Chilling Touch</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. But the mana just… refused to take shape. He couldn’t get it to twist into necromantic mana while holding the tablet. He tried every other spell he knew, from </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vitality Boost </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Summon Spirit</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, but nothing worked. “I can’t.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3MzBiYTExZWViODQ3YmNhYTkzNzRhMWExY2U4Yzg4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan took a deep, shuddering breath. “Ernesto… don’t you understand? You did it. You succeeded. You created the inverted mana. You’ve created holy mana!” </span></p>
