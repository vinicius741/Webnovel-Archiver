<p class="cnNlMWY2NTVjMTQ0NDRkZDU5ZjllZDUyNmEwNzA0YTk1" style="margin-bottom: 0">Jaster Mereel sat in his tent, sipping a drink as he went over the notes of the day’s events. Leaning back in his camp chair, he sighed as he stretched, enjoying being out of his armor for the day.</p>
<p class="cnNlODViY2VmYzE3ODQ0ZjVhOThiZTliNGI0NDVkY2Ew" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM5YzJiNjkwMTVmYjQ1NGQ4ZjJhYzNjNDcxYjFkNDQ3" style="margin-bottom: 0">The Jedi had shown up to the negotiations and separated their two groups, so they could speak privately. Jaster had spent most of the day speaking with the young Master Sifo-Dyas, outlining exactly what it was his side wanted. He had thought that the True Mandalorians’ wants were simple, but the longer he and those close to him spoke with the Jedi, the more complicated things seemed to get.</p>
<p class="cnNkNTRhNDM2ZmMxMDRhYTJiN2YwNDdmNTZiYmRiMzAx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM5OTcxMzgyMzI0MDQ0MjE5YWQyY2VlOTcxZGEzZWVl" style="margin-bottom: 0"><em>Jedi do tend to complicate things,</em><span style="font-style: normal"> he mused, thinking back on the other Jedi Master with them. He recognized Dooku, of course. The man hadn’t changed much since the last time Jaster saw him, even if Jaster himself had a few more gray hairs. Galidraan could have been a disaster, but thankfully the old Jedi Master had seen reason. When it came to light that the call for aid to the Jedi had come not from the lawful government of Galidraan or from oppressed citizens in need of aid, but rather Deathwatch scum trying to use the Jedi to kill the True Mandalorians on the planet working a job, Master Dooku had been rightfully </span><em>perturbed.</em><span style="font-style: normal"> </span><span style="font-style: normal">T</span><span style="font-style: normal">ogether, they had driven most of the Deathwatch off of the planet—those they didn’t kill, </span><span style="font-style: normal">anyway</span><span style="font-style: normal">.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOTUwNmU3NWMyZjQ3NWRhOGIyYTUxNzg5NzFiMGJm" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNiNTk2YjhjOWQ1MzRiNDFiOTYzNWQ2Y2U0NTk1NTdm" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">Hearing footsteps at the front of his large tent, Jaster looked up as Jango pushed his way inside. He slugged back the last of his glass and put the tablet down, grabbing a second glass and filling it and his own, before offering the second to Jango. He studied the man who he’d taken in as a son as Jango pulled his helmet off, brushed his hair out of his eyes, and took the drink. Jaster raised an eyebrow when Jango slugged the drink back and poured another.</p>
<p class="cnM2Mjk2OTM1OGJmZTQ2NGRhNWI2Y2Q2OTEyYTk5NDU1" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM0NjU1MjNjYmU0NjRjNGNhODE5NWQzMTYyZWU5YmY2" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal">A grin pulled at Jaster’s lips as he took a sip, before asking, “Surely one Jedi youngling couldn’t have been </span><em>that</em><span style="font-style: normal"> bad.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjViYWExNGU2MTQ0ZTc4YzUwMGJhZmU5ZmJiYmU3" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNiNTUzY2RlNmJjYzRhOTdhNjExMWUwZTMyMmNlMGNl" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">Jango sent Jaster a knowing look, then shook his head. “It wasn’t what you’re thinking. I was never that bad—”</p>
<p class="cnNiMDAwZjlmZDAzZTRjNjZhMmVkYjE2ZjljMTRiODBj" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM1OWIxMDM0YzA4NjRhMzc4YjcyMTJhN2JjYWZmNGEz" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">“You were a moody little shit as a teenager,” Jaster countered and, after a moment, Jango grudgingly nodded. “Why do you think we spent so much time around cantinas, boy? It was so you’d run off, get drunk, get laid, and get that shit out of your system.”</p>
<p class="cnM2YTkzY2YyZTM1MjRiYThiZmMzZTViNDFmYjMyN2Nh" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNiMzU0MWU3ZGZmMjQwYjVhYTlmOTVhYmZjZjMwMzZi" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<span style="font-style: normal">Yeah, that’s fair,” Jango grunted. “But no, she wasn’t like that.” He grinned, “But I’ll let you see for yourself. She’s outside. I told her you’d tell her about Revan and Canderous Ordo. Apparently, the Jedi have been neglecting their own history.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YjhjYTU3NDRiODRjOGNiODAyNTI2NGViY2ZmMWJk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM1ODMxYjkxMDAxZDQxMDJiNDY1NTFkZjNmNzA2ODIy" style="margin-bottom: 0">Jaster frowned at that, wondering if it was an issue with the youngling’s education, or a symptom of some larger problem within the Jedi Order. If it was the first, that was easily remedied. If it was the second, however, then that may explain some things. It also didn’t bode particularly well for negotiations. But he’d wait and see.</p>
<p class="cnM4YjUxYTVkNTk4MDRjNGE5NjFhMDU0ZDQyODRhYjRi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNmZTllYTg4YzI4OTRiZThiZjA3NmQ0NDQzYjdjOTEy" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Alright. Bring her in.”</p>
<p class="cnM2Mzg2NWY5ZjcyNDRhYjE5MWE5NWFiMGJlMjAzNDA2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNhMDQ0OTIyMDBkNzQ3MmM4ZmFjMDQ2Mzk1YmE0YmI0" style="margin-bottom: 0">Jango nodded and started for the entrance, only to pause and turn. “One more thing. She’s blooded.”</p>
<p class="cnNiNjljZTRlMWRlMjQyODdhMTE0MzM1MzNlYzU4ZDUw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM5N2VhNTE4ZTU1YzQwZmNiNTk4NDU4MGI1NDI4Y2E2" style="margin-bottom: 0">That made Jaster sit up a bit straighter. “That so?” he asked, and Jango nodded. “She seem off?”</p>
<p class="cnM5OWI5M2NlY2YwOTQ1ODk5OTllYjhmZDJkNzIyZGU1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM1YTBmNTdjZjA3MzQ2NjU5Y2U0MzhjZmQxODE1ODUy" style="margin-bottom: 0">The younger man barked a laugh. “Depends on what you mean. She doesn’t seem broken up about it, or like she’s gone stab happy. But she gets these moments…” He trailed off, shivering once. “It’s fucking unsettling. It’s like looking at some apex predator cub.”</p>
<p class="cnNmOWM5Y2YxMmZlZDQxZmQ5YjBhZGE3ZmQ3ZTc2MTg2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMzYjRkNjdjMDViYzQ4MjM4OWYzMmU5Njg3ZjY1ZTMw" style="margin-bottom: 0">Scoffing, Jaster waved towards the entrance. “Alright, bring her in and let papa deal with the scary little girl.”</p>
<p class="cnM1YzhjMDEzYmE3NTRhNjI4NTk4YjQ0Y2ZkOWY3Mjk0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNhMzkyMTE2ZDQ2ODQ2NjNiOTc3NzA1MWQ4MTliOTk1" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Oh fuck you,” Jango rolled his eyes, stomping towards the entrance as Jaster laughed behind him.</p>
<p class="cnM4ODc3MTI5ZmM0MzQwYjZiZjI0N2UwYjcxYjViOWQx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMwYzkwNDUxNDJiNjQwNGQ4OGFmM2Q0Y2ZhZmJhOGZi" style="margin-bottom: 0">Jango pushed open the tent flap and waved the young girl in. She followed Jango in and as she did, Jaster looked her over. She was small—young too. Maybe ten galactic standard years at most, but probably younger.</p>
<p class="cnMzMTRlYjQ3NTcwNTQ1NzZhNThjOWYwYmE3ZTA4MGI3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM5Y2M0N2VkMWJkZjRhZjY5ZmNhYmY3NDg2NmE5NjFh" style="margin-bottom: 0">White hair, silver-blue eyes, pinkish red skin but otherwise human standard. He recognized her species, of course—Jaster was a well-traveled man and knew a Zeltron on sight; after all, he had shared the company of more than one in the past and they were always a special kind of fun. However, this one didn’t have the same feeling to her that he got from her people normally. She looked just as serious now as she had when he’d first seen her with the other Jedi.</p>
<p class="cnMxNDQ0ZDA5ZjA0MTQxYjRhNDBkMzY4N2E5MjNiMzAw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM4NjM2MjY4NTZlZTRkN2ZiMzZjNGU5Y2MzMTYyYzgz" style="margin-bottom: 0">She wore what looked to be the typical Jedi robes, little different from those of the other Jedi she’d come in with, in white with a red under robe peeking through at the collar. A lightsaber hung from either hip, the handle on one of them a bit longer than the other.</p>
<p class="cnNjM2QxOTliNDU5NjQ0NWE5YzdiZjUwY2MxOGE1Njhl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NTQ4MmM2MzM1YTRkNDk5MThjYjk1MTI3MzdlMTgx" style="margin-bottom: 0">She looked around the tent with interest, her eyes sweeping over the room and taking in everything in a single pass before settling on Jaster. Jango left her standing in front of Jaster’s seat while he moved behind Jaster and poured himself another drink. The girl fell into what Jaster recognized as parade rest and waited.</p>
<p class="cnNkNGNkNDc2Y2NhYjQyNDM5NWM2MDYxYWYwNzI0ZmJl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNlYmE1ZjMwZjZhNjRjYzA4ZDViYTBkZmQyYTVmNzZj" style="margin-bottom: 0">Jaster finished the last of his drink and set the glass aside, before leaning forward a bit in his chair. “Tanya, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p class="cnM4ZjNjNTIxMzYzZTQyYzNhOWZjNzFkNjI0NjBjNGI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM1MWFlYTA1MjBjNzRjZjQ5YzllNTRlMDdkYThjM2Qz" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Yes sir,” she answered simply, holding his gaze and waiting.</p>
<p class="cnNlYzYyMTc2ZjAxNzQzOTNhYmNlYjZkNDlmNWVjNDVk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNhNjhlZWFkZmQ3ZDQ3NDY4NDY3Njk3NThjNmJkMTM4" style="margin-bottom: 0">Considering for a moment, he asked, “How did you like today’s lesson?”</p>
<p class="cnNlNDYyZTYxMGYyYzRjM2I4NzU0MjEzZTQ1Nzc0MjNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM4YzM3MmE2MDQ4NDQwMTBiNDdkN2U1Mjg4YmI2OGY2" style="margin-bottom: 0">“It was quite informative,” she smiled, and Jaster felt himself smiling in response. It really was quite charming, especially the way she lit up immediately, the entirely too serious mien falling away for what he was expecting to see from a child her age. “I’ll be happy to get a bit more practice in with blasters, but I’m ready to move on to demolitions and sapping.”</p>
<p class="cnMxYjM4YWEwZTBhMTQwZWRiMjYxMWQ5ODM2OTRiZTFl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNmNTIzNzE0N2UxMjRhM2FhZWNiNzRiMWZhMjFlNzEx" style="margin-bottom: 0">Jaster blinked, confused as he looked between her and Jango. “You’ve only handled a blaster for a day.”</p>
<p class="cnMzYWNkMmYzYjMyMzQzNGE5YjgyN2RhZjJkZjQ4YTI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM0ODQzNmJjYzhmNTRhMzdhYWViOTA0YTYxZDliMDYz" style="margin-bottom: 0">“She doesn’t need more,” Jango grunted, grabbing a chair and moving it over to sit beside Jaster. He gestured vaguely at the other few chairs folded up along the wall and, taking the hint, Tanya pulled one over with the Force and unfolded it in the air, catching it and sitting down at the invitation.</p>
<p class="cnMyYjY1MDdkMjY1NzQwZmNiOWQyNDZlOGNlZTFlMTJl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM4NjFjMGFmM2JmNDQxNWE5Y2ViZjIyMmJjYzczZWQ2" style="margin-bottom: 0">“What do you mean, she doesn’t need more? Even a natural takes months to learn a new weapon. You should know this by now,” Jaster sent Jango a glare, wondering if the man was shirking his duty. It wasn’t like him to do so, but that was one of the few explanations Jaster could come up with for him not wanting to go back to training her with blasters. The other big one being that he just didn’t like her. But that didn’t actually seem to be the case. They seemed to get along well enough. There were no glares, no overt hostility.</p>
<p class="cnM1NWEyNGI5YzIxZjRjN2Q5MjQ3MmUxZDY4YTIzOTZj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNkZThiYTQ5MWY0YzQ3NTdhNTA4NmQ2ZjFhNDhjNDAw" style="margin-bottom: 0">“I mean, she hit every target I put in front of her, at every range, out to the limit of whatever weapon she was firing. Dead center, every time. Stationary or moving targets. Standing, prone, crouched, running, <em>blindfolded</em>. I thought it was just a Jedi thing, but <em>no</em><span style="font-style: normal">. She says she did it all </span><em>with math</em><span style="font-style: normal">,” Jango gestured in Tanya’s direction with his glass, nearly sloshing its contents out onto the tent floor. “Never seen anything like it.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MDQ2NjBjZTYxZjQ3ODJhY2VhY2VmZmFhOGNhNGZj" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM4N2NkYmY1NjZmMjQwNTZhMjA0OGNiYjc3ODE2ZmU4" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal">J</span><span style="font-style: normal">ango hesitated for just a moment, before adding, “I wanted to test, so we switched a couple of the blasters over to training mode. Jaster, she shot blaster bolts out of the air.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMjUwM2JlM2ZmMDQ4N2ZhMDY4MGMwNzhlODEyMGE4" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNhYmZiZGViNDk4NjQ5ZDA4MWZiMGJmY2I1NDc3ODBh" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<span style="font-style: normal">I don’t believe it,” Jaster scoffed.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMTVlMmMxYThjOTQyMGFhM2JlZjYzNDFkNGFjOTMy" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNhZDhjZmU1NGVkYjQxOGNiODU4ZmVlYzc2NTA4OGIx" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">Tanya frowned at that, but remained silent. Jango laughed and pulled his blaster out of its holster. Switching it over to training mode, he tossed it to Tanya, who caught it with the Force and brought it to her hand. “Test her yourself, if you don’t—”</p>
<p class="cnM2ODc5NjY0YzMwNjQ3ZDRhZWE0MzA0MGY3ZjJlNTA3" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMwYzMwZjYzODIwZTQ1OWY4M2FlMmU1NDFjN2Y0ZDJk" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">Jaster drew and fired from the blaster at his hip, aiming just to the side of her head. He didn’t take the time to switch it over to training mode, simply because he didn’t want to warn her ahead of time.</p>
<p class="cnNmZDU1NWQzMTg1ZjRiZTNhMzY3OTdhOGNjNzYxMWY2" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNjMTlkOTViZDg5MjRjNTZhZmMxMGY3ZDBlZWY0YjJl" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">The girl’s reflexes were faster, her own blaster coming up faster than Jaster could draw. Playing it back in his head after the fact, she had fired an instant before he did. His bolt hit hers and detonated with a flash and a loud boom that rattled the tent walls.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZDgxMjI3NWE1YTQ4YWI4YTI2NDc3ZjM4NzY0ZGZh" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM4YmQzNTZmN2M5ZTRmMDc4NGI4MTYzOWZhY2JjZWU0" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal">The follow up shots, Jaster wasn’t expecting, but </span><em>he liked her initiative!</em><span style="font-style: normal"> He rolled out of his seat as her aim shifted to him, thumb flicking the thing to low power mode as he returned fire, her shots slipping by so narrowly that the only reason she missed was because she hadn’t expected him to be that fast. </span><span style="font-style: normal">The next two shots caught him in either knee as they were moving, but he ignored them.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZWFiNGI5MGRkNTQ0MmY4NGNjNjk4OThmOTM2MGFm" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM5ZTJkZDQwZWE2YzQ5YWJhYTg3MmExY2RkZWQ1MmU4" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal">To his surprise, one of the lightsabers leapt off her belt and into her hand, filling the room with a </span><em>snap-hiss</em><span style="font-style: normal"> and a hum, and silver-white light as she </span><em>slapped his bolts out of the air</em><span style="font-style: normal">. He flicked the blaster over to full auto and squeezed the trigger, only for her to close the short distance between them in the blink of an eye, that white-silver blade hitting his wrist and forcing his aim off over her shoulder, while her other hand came up and leveled the blaster in her hand in his face.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDRlNmE3MWE5ZjQ2NzRiOTA0NmRmYjY2NDQ1NDAx" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMxNDI4MzVhZGM0NzRiODg4NzcyOGI5MjJmMzIyZWRj" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal">That was when Jaster saw it. What he thought had unnerved Jango. The girl’s smile, which had been one of the sweetest things he’d seen in an age when she was happily talking earlier, had changed. Her eyes were wide open, staring him down with a look that only bore a </span><em>passing resemblance</em><span style="font-style: normal"> to a smile. No, it was the sort of </span><em>smile</em><span style="font-style: normal"> one saw on some apex predators, right before they ripped someone’s throat out.</span></p>

<p class="cnM4MzZkNGY5ZTE2NTQ0YWE4OTAwMmYwZTUzMjdlYjA3" style="margin-bottom: 0">The <em>enthusiasm</em><span style="font-style: normal"> in that question </span><em>bothered</em><span style="font-style: normal"> Jaster. He’d seen battle maniacs before, so he knew the type, but </span><em>this one</em> had them beat. <span style="font-style: normal">It was clear she loved what she did. But to enjoy it that much, and be that good at it, at her age…</span></p>

Seeing that, she pouted minutely and tucked away her lightsaber, before making her way over to return Jango’s blaster.</span></p>

<p class="cnMxZjk0NDk5OTVkYzQyMDBiYWNlZDZjNzNkYzg5MDJi" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<span style="font-style: normal">Some other time, perhaps,” Jaster murmured, before an idea occurred. His men could always use more training and they’d probably enjoy a chance to train against a Jedi who wasn’t actively trying to kill them. That, and the </span><em>absolute humiliation</em><span style="font-style: normal"> of losing to a little girl would be hilarious and keep him stocked up on insults to motivate them for years to come. “Maybe I’ll talk to the men and see if they would be interested.”</span></p>

<p class="cnMzN2FkZGM3ZjU3ZjRhZDVhM2QxNDg3YmQwMDU1NWRm" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">Jaster turned and met Jango’s eyes and an entire conversation passed between them silently. Jaster wasn’t too proud to acknowledge when he was wrong, but Jango’s respect for Jaster meant he wouldn’t push the issue. Apology and understanding passed between them and Jaster said, “Proceed however you think is best.”</p>
<p class="cnM2MTU3MTE3YmM3YTRhMzFhNGNmNDEwMTg0MGNhODZj" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNjYjNlYWQ1OWIxYzQxN2E4N2FjOGEzOWFmNjViNGM1" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">“Understood,” Jango nodded.</p>

<p class="cnM0YzQ2ODdiYjE0NDQ0YjJiNzBkYTgwNDZlNjM5OTJh" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">“I do,” the girl agreed, nodding eagerly. “I have yet to attend any lessons on history at the academy, if they hold them at all. I’m uncertain on that. I would need to ask Obi-wan or one of the Masters to verify one way or the other. It could be that they leave it up to self-study, or perhaps they focus on practical aspects first.” A rueful look crossed her face and her head tilted slightly to the right. “Or rather, that’s where I’ve focused the majority of my training efforts—into practical skills. I’ve prioritized learning how to stay alive and perfecting the means to do so and now I find myself lacking in areas where my peers may be more well-rounded.”</p>

However, in the right moment, it could be the difference between life or death.</em><em> Since we spoke of Revan, I will teach you of one of his skills—one shared with Darth Traya.”</em><span style="font-style: normal"> Gesturing towards my belt, he asked, </span><em>“What is the point of more weapons than hands to use them? That is the idea behind the skill of using Force Telekinesis to control multiple weapons simultaneously, allowing you to strike from unpredictable angles, block attacks, deflect blaster bolts, and use all of your other lightsaber skills without holding the weapon in your hand. Master the skill of Force Telekinesis, and controlling your weapons with it, and you will be able to overpower others attempting to wrest control of your weapons from you.”</em></p>

Certainly, it allows one an ability to use </em><span style="font-style: normal">foresight</span><em>, to see glimpses of the future. However, that is sometimes inconsistent, especially with visions further out into the future. The much more practical and reliable use for the skill is to view people, places, and things in the present, as they are right now. That is, clairvoyance. Such visions of the present are almost always accurate. In this way, you can see, hear, and sometimes sense what your target is doing or planning. Why don’t you try it now? Close your eyes and focus on someone familiar to you. Reach out with the Force and try to see them as they are in this very moment.”</em></p>
