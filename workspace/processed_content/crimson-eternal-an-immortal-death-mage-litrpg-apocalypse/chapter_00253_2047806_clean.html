  As it turns out, death magic is actually very easy to learn. For me, at least. Whether it’s the same for other death mages or not doesn’t really matter to me.
 </p>
<p>
  It’s entirely possible that it’s easy because I’m Death.
 </p>
<p>
  In fact, that’s likely why it’s easy, seeing as learning death magic so far has felt more like I’m relearning something I forgot instead of learning an entire magic system for the first time.
 </p>
<p>
  All that aside though, using death magic is as simple as writing out how I want magic to act in a certain way with special characters. It’s a little like programming, actually. Not that I have much experience in that area.
 </p>
<p>
  Little Blue likes programming though, and she had me join her when she was younger.
 </p>
<p>
  Except that this programming is a simpler version.
 </p>
<p>
  Kind of like that block version of programming where the ‘code’ is placed into simple blocks that can be matched together rather than some complicated script.
 </p>
<p>
  But not literally, since they aren’t blocks. They’re runes.
 </p>
<p>
  Amongst the runes, there are runes that let me convert death energy into miasma, expel miasma from my body, expel death energy from my body, move the death energy in specific directions like left or right or up or down, and various other things. Like entering specific objects to pass through them carefully in death energy form, entering them to corrupt them in miasma form into an undead, and so on.
 </p>
<p>
  So I spend almost an entire year working on just my death magic in the Plane of Death while my Death Spirits continue slaughtering mana creatures in the Endless Glacier. And through this process, I level up one more time and manage to start using basic death magic.
 </p>
<p>
  Then I finally leave the Plane of Death and the Endless Glacier altogether. Heading over towards the capital city with my Death Spirits all returned to the Plane of Death.
 </p>
<p>
  Because I’m finally ready to leave this planet.
 </p>
<p>
  When I go to tell the king about it though, I find him looking rather relieved for some reason.
 </p>
<p>
  I narrow my eyes at the man as he sits on his throne with a wide smile on his face. Then I glance at the other advisors around him, each of whom look just as relieved as him.
 </p>
<p>
  After they notice my look though, they all quickly wipe the relief off their faces.
 </p>
<p>
  I stare at them, wondering just why they all seem so relieved and happy about the idea of me leaving. But eventually I just sigh and turn around to walk away.
 </p>
<p>
  Because I don’t really care at the end of the day.
 </p>
<p>
  After all, I’m not likely to ever come to this world ever again.
 </p>
<p>
  At least, not for thousands or even tens of thousands of years.
 </p>
<p>
  I head straight towards my ship, where I find Leone already waiting for me in the bridge. With the girl just lying down on one of the many seats while yawning.

<p>
  Once she sees me, she asks, “So where are we goin next, cap’n?”
 </p>
<p>
  I raise a brow at that manner of addressing me, only to shrug and head over to the commander’s chair as I state out loud, “Crimson, bring up the star map.”
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   |Showing the star map.|
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Along with his voice, a massive holographic map appears in front of me with the nearby star systems and planets. And I just lean forwards while looking at the map.
 </p>
<p>
  But there are too many worlds on it.
 </p>
<p>
  Waaay too many.
 </p>
<p>
  I purse my lips before eventually just telling Crimson, “Choose a random planet that has contacted us and we can get rights to enter.”
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   |Understood, Lady Aria. Selection in process.|
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  One after another, the planets on the map gradually begin to disappear. All the way till only a single planet remains.
 </p>
<p>
  And this planet leaves me surprised.
 </p>
<p>
  Because it’s a very well known place. And not really a planet.
 </p>
<p>
  The Star Link Stations. A solar system filled with dozens upon dozens of massive space stations instead of planets. All of which are linked by trains yet none of them have any sort of real ruler leading them.
 </p>
<p>
  Unlike most nations, the Star Link Stations are completely neutral in all matters and are each led by someone with the title of ‘Star’. But these Stars are all chosen by rather strict rules.
 </p>
<p>
  Each Star must fulfil certain requirements. They must have some sort of light or radiation-based magic. They must be the highest level person living on that station, with visitors not being included. And they must follow the laws of the Star Link Stations.
 </p>
<p>
  Very strict laws at that.
 </p>
<p>
  And the only way to make new laws for the stations is for every last current Star ruling over the stations to agree on a new law. Which hasn’t happened in over five hundred years.
 </p>
<p>
  I share a glance with Leone before looking at the map again. At the four dozen massive stations spread across the solar system on it.
 </p>
<p>
  “Alright, looks like we’re going to the Star Link Stations,” I state with a faint smile on my face.
 </p>
<p>
  The only reason why I’m fine with this is because I’m rather curious about the place. Especially about the Hunter’s Spots across the solar system.
 </p>
<p>
  Because the solar system in question is unique in that there are no planets whatsoever. Just the stations. But there are still Hunter’s Spots spread across the solar system despite that.
 </p>
<p>
  And all of these Hunter’s Spots? They’re in the form of worm holes in space.
 </p>
<p>
  It’s a rather unique and interesting place, so I’m actually looking forward to seeing it. And it’s also pretty, uh, peaceful? Sort of.
 </p>
<p>
  There’s peace between the stations and other nations.
 </p>
<p>
  But no peace inside of the stations themselves, seeing as they’re always fighting to become the highest level person in the station so that they can overtake the current Star in each station.
 </p>
<p>
  Which makes it a rather wild place to be.
 </p>
<p>
  I’ve actually been contacted by at least two dozen Stars already. So getting permission to enter the place is a very simple matter.
 </p>
<p>
  Although each one wants me to visit for different reasons.
 </p>
<p>
  A dozen of them directly state that they want me to fight for them while I’m there for at least a period of time.
 </p>
<p>
  Another half dozen state that they just want me there to keep the people fighting peaceful while I’m there, since a lot of people will be too intimidated to cause trouble while I’m there.
 </p>
<p>
  Four of them just state that they want me to visit sometime and don’t give any reason, and the last two seem to be trying to get in my good graces both to make a favorable impression on me and the people I know.
 </p>
<p>
  At the end of the day, I think I’ll go with one of the last two.
 </p>
<p>
  After all, it’d be nicer to just relax while there rather than fighting for some random person’s benefit.
 </p>
<p>
  If there’s no reason to fight in other people’s war, then I won’t. And when I don’t have to go to war to go where I want, I won’t.
 </p>
<p>
  It’s as simple as that.
 </p>
<p>
  While the ship starts to leave the planet behind, I lean my cheek against my palm with my elbow on the armrest of my seat as I think about the Hunter’s Spots. Wormholes that lead into strange, warped realities. Ones filled with mana creatures of all sorts that change every time someone new enters the place. Someone who has never been inside one before.
 </p>
<p>
  Meanwhile the Hunter’s Spots themselves are called Fractures. Since the places are so warped, with the gravity being all messed up and sometimes having the ‘ground’ being the ceiling or even the walls.
 </p>
<p>
  Overall, a very unique place in the universe. One with very few other places like it.
 </p>
<p>
  I smile as I look out the window of the bridge at the approaching space and the few other ships leaving the atmosphere of the planet.
 </p>
<p>
  This will be an interesting trip, that’s for sure.
