  <span>
   “Ugh…” Shiina grunted as her consciousness returned to her. This was the second time she had fainted due to an angel’s powers, and she definitely hadn’t gotten used to it in the slightest.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As she got to her feet, she began noticing the surrounding environment. Unlike before, it wasn’t nighttime, when the only source of light was that orb Hikari had conjured. However, she could tell the sun was very low in the sky, since it was being blocked by the treeline. After turning around, she confirmed her surroundings—she was right next to the sacred Shrine she was never supposed to see in her lifetime.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The second thing she noticed was that she was alone. Of course, the last thing she remembered, her fellow angel Hikari had been here too, disguised as a human who Takeya and Ayumi had called “Kotori”. But she was nowhere to be found.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <span>
    Did she abandon me here?
   </span>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The thought didn’t exactly surprise the young woman. It would, in fact, be the most obvious step for such a celebrity to take. However, something felt wrong to her.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <span>
    No, wait, I shouldn’t even be here in the first place. She wouldn’t do something like that.
   </span>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Just as Shiina was wondering what her next step should be, the Shrine’s doors opened slowly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   And from within came a person Shiina had never met before, but one every angel knew about.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A tall, perfectly sculpted body, with curves in all the right places.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Golden, wavy hair cascading down her back.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A face so pristine and flawless she almost couldn’t believe it was from a real person.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   And finally, the dark-blue dress with golden accents that hugged her body, accentuating her natural beauty and that showed just enough skin to be sexy, but not lewd.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “...Ah.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Shiina couldn’t help but gasp in awe. Of course, she knew what Hikari looked like from photographs in newspapers, and she had heard rumors of her otherworldly beauty many times. But those photos were in black and white and grainy, and rumors in general are often greatly exaggerated.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   But not this time. If anything, the rumors were
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    understating
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   just what being in Hikari’s presence felt like. Perhaps words couldn’t quite convey it. Her beauty was imposing—almost crushing. Shiina didn’t think she was particularly unattractive, but next to Hikari, the comparison didn’t even make sense. The young angel couldn’t tell if she was physically attracted to her or not; in fact, she felt this was a sensation that surpassed such base desires.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Like all other angels, Shiina had a very close relation with the divine. And, for the first time in her life, she could apply that word—divine—to something tangible. She wasn’t even sure if it was okay to look at Hikari with her filthy eyes.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Oh, Shiina. You are up?” The goddess said nonchalantly, with a soft, natural smile.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Only then did Shiina break out of her trance.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Y-Yes,” she said, trying to keep her cool, as Hikari approached her. “I see you are… you.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The two women were now just steps apart. Being this close to her, Shiina could see Hikari’s expression with as much clarity as she could possibly hope for—a privileged only select angels had. And only then could she tell that her seemingly perfect smile had just a tinge of something slightly less pure. A deep desire, or an ego even stronger than her beauty.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <span>
    No, it might just all be in my head.
   </span>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   That single crack in Hikari’s armor, real or imaginary, was enough for Shiina to calm down just slightly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “W-what happened while I was out?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Ah, well.” The question seemed to take Hikari aback somehow. “I woke up before you, and I was curious about what the inside of the Shrine looked like, so I took a peek and ended up transforming while I was at it.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “How l-long was I out for?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Hikari walked past Shiina, so the younger angel couldn’t tell what her expression was anymore. “I do not know how long we were both out. But since I woke up, it has not been more than a few minutes.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “I… see. But you had time to… c-change clothes?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Oh, this?” Hikari turned around, and shot Shiina another smile. It was just as perfect, but the intent was different. It was almost like she was mocking her. “Naturally, I can transform clothes as well.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “You… can?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Indeed. Especially something I wear all the time like this dress is not a hard task.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Right… O-of course.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Unlike what Hikari had just stated, transforming something as delicate and intricate as clothing
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    was
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   a hard task. It was way beyond what she could do. In fact, most cloth-making in the Upper Realm was made using looms. Only the actual fibers were made by angels.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <span>
    And she did it in just a few minutes?
   </span>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Of course, she could be lying, but Shiina had a feeling she wasn’t. And anyway, the mere concept of shapeshifting was already ridiculous on its own. There was a good reason why no one had attempted it before, at least not to this extent. The anatomical knowledge needed to transform one’s own body safely was beyond what any angel could achieve. At least, that’s what conventional wisdom would state.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   But here she was—the proof that shattered that conventional wisdom—in the flesh. The Hikari that looked like a plain high school student had transformed into the remarkable beauty in front of her. Unless there was some other trickery Shiina couldn’t imagine, she could indeed shapeshift.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   And thus, there was only one conclusion she could make.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <span>
    She’s… she’s a monster…
   </span>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   But she didn’t let that thought show on her face, and did the best she could to continue the conversation. “D-did Ayumi end up turning you into an a-archangel after all?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Hmm. I believe she did. Although I do not feel any different from usual… But enough about me. How about you, Shiina? How are you feeling? I can tell you are an angel now, but just to be sure, have your powers returned?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Only after she mentioned her powers did Shiina remember to check. And yes, when she concentrated, she could feel deep inside herself the connection to God she had lost once before.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   It made her feel warm and comfortable, like she just got back a missing limb.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   But then she realized that that feeling, too, was a sham.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <span>
    Is this just a way for the system to tell me my powers exist?
   </span>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   That warm feeling suddenly became sickly sweet, almost intoxicating—a fake warmth whose purpose was to trick and subdue her thoughts.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Her mind began to spiral, and only the voice of her comrade brought it back to the present.
  </span>
 </p>
 <span>
  <br/>
  This story has been taken without authorization. Report any sightings.
  <br/>
 </span>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Shiina? Everything alright?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Yes… Everything is fine.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “...If you say so.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “And yes… m-my powers have returned.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Great.” Hikari sounded genuinely relieved, which took Shiina by surprise. “The fact you have your memories means you are likely an archangel, just like I am.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “I-I suppose.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   It still didn’t feel real to her. Her—a mere lackey with almost zero power—an archangel? Truly, only someone who broke every convention by her mere existence could make such a ludicrous scenario a reality.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Although… I must say something is bothering me.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Huh?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “I would assume you would have activated your personality-switching powers as soon as you could. So why are you speaking with your ‘human’ voice?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “...Ahh.” A lump got stuck in Shiina’s throat. Her mind had been so thoroughly bruised by the rollercoaster ride of the last few hours that she had totally forgotten she should have “switched” her personality.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Then, Hikari put on a pensive look. “Could it be… my assumption was wrong? You do not have any power of the sort?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “I…” It was do-or-die for Shiina. But her brain froze. The number of people who knew about her secret could be counted with one finger. She was mortified of increasing it by one. However, she found Hikari’s pressure so strong, she couldn’t outright lie to her, either.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Do not worry,” Hikari said after noticing Shiina’s conflict. “It seems there are some circumstances, so I will not be prying any deeper. I will keep your secret. And in return, I expect you keep mine.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “O-Of course…”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <span>
    These two secrets aren’t even close to being on the same level…
   </span>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “We can talk about this later if you want. Right now, we have more pressing issues.” Hikari then sat down on the stairs leading to the Shrine and adopted a melancholic look.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Shiina almost asked her if she was okay soiling her dress. Shiina felt awkward standing around, so she sat next to Hikari, a good three palms away.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A few minutes passed. The two women remained silent, seemingly enjoying the tranquility of the Sacred Forest and the distant rumbling of the waterfall. For that short period of time, Shiina felt she could just ignore everything that had happened to them, and just enjoy the contemplative moment.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   But, of course, that moment was fleeting. The newly-minted archangel sighed.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “We have to figure out what to do next. We cannot stand around here doing nothing.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Shiina nodded. She didn’t need Hikari to tell her what they had to decide.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Right now, every angel should be busy doing their missions, but soon enough people will figure out the archangels are missing. Such an important decision, and we have basically no time to decide or prepare. What a conundrum. That Ayumi really did a number on us.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Shiina remained silent, waiting for Hikari to make her move. Despite herself being technically an archangel as well, she had no right to decide the fate of all the angels—or even give her opinion on the subject at all. Hikari had to be the one to decide these things.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   But it appeared the other woman wasn’t going to let her get away with such nebulous logic.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “What do you think, Shiina? Should we tell them? About ‘the truth’? Causing chaos in our entire society? Or should we keep this quiet and lie about the disappearance of the archangels? Keeping society intact?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Even having been asked such a direct question, Shiina decided to avoid it. “I d-don’t think I should give an opinion on that,” she said, not looking at her companion.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Why not?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “I am… but a mere angel. Such d-decisions should be left to you, since you’re the one who’s going to lead us moving forward.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Hmm.” Hikari was unusually pensive. Then, the archangel grabbed Shiina’s hand, despite her being quite a ways away. The younger angel jolted slightly at the unexpected skin contact.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Y-Yes?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Shiina, I understand how you feel right now. I truly do. This is a bit too much to take in. However, your opinion is invaluable to me, as a fellow archangel, and as someone who went through this incident together with me.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “B-but… all I did was tell A-Archangel Mich—”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Stop it,” Hikari said with some force. “You did what any angel in your position would have done. Please do not chastise yourself for what you did back then. You could not have known it was the wrong thing to do.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Shiina dropped her head slightly. Her long hair had fallen forward, blocking her from seeing Hikari.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Even still… I do not want to be an archangel. I can’t… lead the angels.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “I understand. This is an awkward position for me as well. Being given such responsibility out of the blue is tough to handle. Whatever we decide on doing, rest assured I will not involve you directly.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Thank you.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “However, I still would like your advice.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Shiina felt her hand being squeezed just the tiniest bit tighter when Hikari said that.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <span>
    Hikari… is she unsure of herself?
   </span>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Many things will change moving forward. I should not be the one deciding on all these on my own. So I would like you to give me your opinion when necessary. Is that alright with you?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “S-Sure. I can t-try.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Hikari finally released Shiina’s hand, and got right back on track.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “I will be honest. Emotionally, I’m inclined to tell everyone. Rip the band-aid right off, just like it was done to me. But…”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Here, Shiina decided to finally give her honest opinion. “T-That would cause chaos. Not every angel could take it as well as you did. To lose their sense of being all of a sudden… It’s very possible some people might resort to extreme measures.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Yes, I could not agree more. This situation is already chaotic enough. Adding that on top would have serious unforeseen consequences. Earth itself would be in jeopardy.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “I-I feel bad lying to everyone, but… I think this is the best o-option we have.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Agreed.” Hikari sighed. “So now the question is how society will change, and how to enact that transition.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “What angels will do now…right?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Yes.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   All her life, Shiina had learned that angels’ sole purpose was to implement God’s plan to Earth. Anything else angels did was in support of that—which included, of course, fixing faults and working in services in the Upper Realm. Most angels she knew worked on missions, even if only part-time—because that was their duty.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Over 70% of angels do missions and fix faults exclusively,” Hikari said. “And of the remaining 30%, only a vanishingly small amount do not participate in missions at all. Even if we make angels follow a standard human work day of eight hours, and massively increase the number of angels patrolling for faults, there will be many people who will have nothing to do. People, mind you, who have world-bending powers. Who will be extremely disoriented by these changes. This is the recipe for a disaster.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <span>
    I didn’t think this far ahead…!
   </span>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “T-that is… a big problem.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Indeed. Angel society will have to drastically change. The economy can no longer revolve around missions and supporting those who partake in them. Angels will have to start working more creative jobs, for example.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “C-creative…? Like before?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Indeed. Just goes to show how much those bastards bent our society to support their greed.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Shiina paused for a moment to reflect on just how much a monumental change this was. The whirlwind of the last few hours had hit the junior angel hard, and most of its aftermath left her confused and disoriented. This was, however, the only piece of good news that had come out of this situation.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Ever since Shiina graduated, the number of faults had increased to such a degree that angels were forced to constantly overwork just to keep up. However, she had learned from older angels that during the term of the previous Archangels—who she now knew were actually Ayumi’s parents—angels actually had free time and hobbies. There had been small, but flourishing writing, theater, and music communities, while other angels learned, trained or researched their powers, and some even partook in martial arts. They even used to hold fairs regularly all across the various islands. But all that changed when the now-ousted Archangels came to power and slowly eroded all those recreational activities from angels’ lives.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Realizing all this, a small flower of hope bloomed within Shiina. Maybe things wouldn’t be so bad, after all. “I think that’s a wonderful idea,” she said with a small smile.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Then, uncharacteristically, Hikari sighed. “Unfortunately, I’m not well-versed in economic matters. That must be a top priority when deciding on whom the next archangels will be.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “R-right.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “So with that decided, now the question is exactly how to explain how the Archangels disappeared and how I, of all people, became an archangel.” Hikari giggled slightly. “What a bizarre situation. That Ayumi… leaving us with nothing but trouble until the very end.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The two women shared a slight smile, and returned to pondering. Some minutes passed. The only sound that could be heard was that of the distant waterfall. Then, all of a sudden, Hikari rose from the stairs.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Alright. I think I have it. I just have to tell everyone a story.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Shiina crooked her head. “A… story?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “You know, the best lies are the ones with a grain of truth in them. I think this is a good story that will convince everyone.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “I h-hope so, too.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Since you do not want to get publicly involved, I shall not mention your name. But at least I hope you will listen to my speech.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “I will.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Great. So this is our goodbye.” Then, a sly smile rose in Hikari’s face. “For now. But I hope we can meet again after everything calmed down. I really do have a lot to discuss with you.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Shiina merely nodded. Content, Hikari smiled at her and immediately disappeared from sight, having teleported away to somewhere uncertain, leaving a small gust of wind in her wake. Shiina took one last look around the Sacred Forest she should have never stepped a foot into, and finally teleported herself away as well—or she should have, anyway.
  </span>
