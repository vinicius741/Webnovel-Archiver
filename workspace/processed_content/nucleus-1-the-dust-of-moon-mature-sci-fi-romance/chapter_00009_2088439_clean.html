   Thousands of kilometers from the Amber Moon Spire where the Imperium risked everything for the Crystal's data, another piece of the puzzle was falling into place. The Directorate had their own plans — and they would need the brightest and newest of their soldiers to execute them.

   </span>
   abari Adomako studied his reflection in the mirror, adjusting the high collar of his graduation uniform. The deep green fabric with gold trim fit his shoulders well.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Perfect," he said. "Almost perfect."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   His hands shook slightly as he smoothed down his jacket. Today wasn't just graduation. It was assignment day. The moment that would decide if all the years were worth it.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A television, in the modern form of a holoscreen on the wall beside him, flickered with breaking news: "...unprecedented Radi-Mon activity across three continents. Chicago authorities report..."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari paused, watching the footage of a blonde woman in Alliance colors cutting down monsters with a blue energy blade.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Psytum Sword?" Instead of noticing the woman's ivory complexion or sapphire eyes, his attention focused on the weapon she wielded to slice a Bone Fiend lunging at her in half. He'd heard of stories about psionic people able to wield such powerful blades.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A competent warrior as the woman appeared, something about her movements in her beige trench coat seemed almost desperate, as if she was running from more than just the creatures.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Look at you, trying to impress the brass." Kwame lounged in the doorway, already in his dress uniform. His smile didn't quite reach his eyes. "Heard anything about your placement yet?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Not yet." Jabari turned from the mirror, trying to sound casual. "You?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Support division, Benin City." Kwame shrugged. "Safe posting, and the pay is okay. Better than ending up in one of the combat warbands. Did you hear about the latest Kimaris casualties?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari's stomach tightened. "No?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Three Scarab Riders, gone. Just like that. Radi-Mon ambush on Osram's Far Side. Aabon survived and came back — only to find Tracy hooking up with another guy."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "By Anansi, that's rough…" Jabari frowned, his posture shifting.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Really is," Kwame shook his head. "That's why I've been saving up for a Da-Ji. At least androids don't die or cheat on you, right?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Before Jabari could respond, a sharp tone cut through the air - the first warning bell for the ceremony. Through the window, he watched other graduates coming out from the domed buildings, filing onto the palm-lined paths below.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Should head to the mess first," Kwame said. "Last meal as cadets."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari nodded, taking one final look in the mirror before walking away.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The mess hall was on the third tier of Dome 3, with transparent walls offering a view of the academy grounds. Fans whirred overhead, casting shadows across the tables. The smell of jollof rice and grilled tilapia filled the air.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari sat with his back to the window, focusing on his plate. The food was better than usual today - rice rich with tomatoes and spices, perfectly grilled fish, and a small bowl of fiery shito pepper sauce. But each bite felt heavy as conversation floated around him.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Word is the Imperium found something on the moon. Something that'll make all our fusion waste worth more than gold."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "...the Moondust Crystal, and every Radi-Mon in the system will bow to whoever holds it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Sounds like another Imperial anime with predictable endings."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "...heard Prince Laurent's gone insane after the last mission..."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "...they say the Kimaris compound in Abidjan is haunted..."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "My cousin's friend was stationed there. Said the screams from the infirmary..."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Don't they get huge discounts for those Leased Lilies on Venus, though? All the pretty people you can bed — "
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "How's that worth anything if you're always fucking dying?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Jabari!" A sharp voice cut through the chatter. Aisha, top of their tactical class, dropped into the seat across from him. Her uniform was already immaculate, ready for the ceremony. "Is it true? Are the rumors about your placement real?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He looked up, fork halfway to his mouth. "What rumors?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Come on, everyone's talking about it. They say you're being considered for Kimaris." Her voice dropped lower. "But there's also talk that Captain Osei is questioning your readiness. Something about the Radi-Mon simulation last month?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The rice turned to ash in Jabari's mouth. The simulation. He'd hesitated for just three seconds when the Radi-Mon hologram appeared, lurching out of the darkness. Three seconds.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It was one training exercise," he managed, but his appetite had vanished. Through the window, he could see more graduates gathering near the Tower of Anansi.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "One exercise could mean life or death out there," Aisha said, not unkindly. "Especially in Kimaris. Look, there's still time to request a different placement. No shame, you know?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The speakers crackled to life: "All graduating cadets report to the Tower of Anansi! Repeat: all graduating cadets..."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari stood abruptly, his chair scraping against the floor. The untouched shito sauce trembled in its bowl, as red as blood. "We should go."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He walked down the path toward the Tower of Anansi, fighting the urge to run. Palm trees rustled overhead, their shadows moving across the walkway. Each step brought the tower closer - its lights already on despite the afternoon sun, creating a halo around its metallic frame.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Adomako!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The voice stopped him cold. Captain Osei stepped out from behind a pillar, his ceremonial armor gleaming. The red evaluation tablet in his hand might as well have been a weapon.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Sir!" Jabari snapped to attention, pulse pounding in his ears.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "At ease." He studied the tablet, expression blank. "Your final evaluation is... concerning."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Sir, if this is about the simulation-"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Three seconds, Adomako." His eyes met Jabari's. "Three seconds of hesitation against a basic Skuggr projection. What happens when it's real? When your whole warband is counting on you?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It won't happen again, sir." The words felt hollow even as he said them.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "No, it won't. Because I'm recommending -"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Captain Osei!" Sergeant Keita's voice boomed across the courtyard. Jabari turned to see the veteran approaching, his heavy combat armor making the ground shake slightly with each step. "A word about the cadet?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Osei's jaw tightened. "Sergeant, this is hardly the time-"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Three minutes of your time, Captain. That's all I ask." Sulayman's scarred face was stern, but there was fire in his eyes Jabari had never seen before. "Let me tell you about the real Jabari Adomako."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Osei hesitated, then nodded curtly. "Fine. Adomako, wait here."
  </span>
 </p>
 <span>
  <br/>
  If you stumble upon this narrative on Amazon, be aware that it has been stolen from Royal Road. Please report it.
  <br/>
 </span>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari watched them move away, speaking in low voices. His future hung in the balance, and all he could do was stand there, the Tower of Anansi looming behind him.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The graduation ceremony would start in less than ten minutes. And he still didn't know if he'd be part of it.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Waiting beneath the Tower felt like forever. Jabari forced himself to breathe steadily, watching Sulayman and Captain Osei through the crystal panels at the tower's base. Their reflections split across the surfaces, making it impossible to read their expressions.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The tower itself seemed to mock him. It rose above like a spear of obsidian and steel, its eight legs - inspired by the trickster god's form - curving up into spirals of metal. Solar panels shifted between the legs, tracking the sun. Ancient wisdom and modern might, merged. Everything the Directorate stood for. Everything he might lose.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   More graduates filed past him, their gold-trimmed uniforms standing out against the tower's dark surface. Some gave him questioning looks. Others whispered behind their hands.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "...Osei's going to fail him..."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "...shame, he was one of the best..."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "...better than ending up in Kimaris anyway..."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The murmurs faded as Sulayman and Osei's discussion grew more animated. Sulayman jabbed a finger at the evaluation tablet, his armor humming with the movement. Osei's face had turned angry, but he seemed to be listening.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A shadow fell over Jabari. He looked up to see the tower's spider emblem lighting up. The ceremony would begin in minutes. His chest felt tight, as if his uniform had suddenly shrunk.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   What would he tell his family? That he'd failed because of three seconds of hesitation? That all their sacrifices had been for-
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Adomako." Captain Osei's voice cut through his thoughts. Both officers had returned, Sulayman's expression still hard as stone.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Sir." Jabari's voice cracked slightly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Osei held up the tablet, its surface glowing with updated text. "Sergeant Keita has... provided context about your performance. Your combat scores are exemplary. Your tactical thinking, outstanding." He paused, jaw working. "And apparently, your ability to overcome fear - to acknowledge it and push through - is exactly what Kimaris needs."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Wow," relief flooded through Jabari so fast it made him dizzy. "Sir, I-"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Don't thank me yet, cadet." Osei's eyes narrowed. "Kimaris isn't just any warband. They hunt the worst horrors in the Five Realms. One hesitation out there..." He let the words hang.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "There won't be, sir. I swear it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "See that there isn't." Osei turned sharply and walked away, tablet under his arm.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Sulayman watched him go, then turned to Jabari. "You can't freeze again, Jabari. Not with Kimaris."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I won't, Sergeant. But..." Jabari swallowed hard. "Why did you defend me?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A hint of a smile crossed Sulayman's scarred face. "Because fear isn't the enemy. Lying to yourself about being fearless is." He gestured toward the tower's entrance, where other graduates were gathering. "Now go. Make us proud."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As Jabari joined the formation, back straight and head high, he could still feel the weight of the future pressing down on him. But now, at least, he had a chance to face it.
  </span>

   13:00, February 6, 2295
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Tower of Anansi, Cape Coast Preparatory School, Ghana, Emerald Directorate territory
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Tower of Anansi's grand hall stretched upward like a cathedral, its walls lined with holograms showing the Directorate's history. Images flickered: the first African colonies on Osram, the founding of Ndovu Zenith, battles against Radi-Mons in space. Sunlight streamed through the tower's crystal top, casting web patterns across the assembled graduates.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Below, the academy's fusion complex sprawled beneath the domed buildings. Unlike the Alliance's hidden cores or the Imperium's showy displays, the Directorate proudly showcased their approach to Zephyrium processing. Solar panels tracked the sun overhead, working together with the fusion reaction below in what engineers called "The Perfect Circle" - a blend of natural and artificial power.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Large Zephyrium crystals, carved with traditional African patterns, pulsed with swirling blues and greens. Their light cast shifting shadows through the walkway's panels, a constant reminder of the power flowing beneath their feet.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari stood at attention in the front row, aware of every detail. The whir of the building's fusion core. The faint smell of ozone from the projectors. The steady breathing of his fellow graduates, all waiting for the moment that would define their futures.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Oguamtrani approaches!" The ceremonial guard called out, striking his vibro-spear on the floor with a boom. "All hail Chairman Mensah!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Unity! Strength! Directorate!" The response thundered through the hall, Jabari joining in. The words felt heavier now.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kofi Mensah stepped onto the golden podium, his presence filling the hall. His clean-shaven head and sharp features showed decades of leadership, while his eyes held an intelligence that seemed to see through everything. His green blazer with gold embroidery complemented his dark skin. The lion-shaped medallion at his chest caught the light, gleaming against the rich fabric.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "We gather today," Kofi began, his voice carrying through the space, "to welcome new guardians into our ranks. Each graduate here represents the finest qualities of the Directorate - courage, innovation, and unwavering dedication to our shared future."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Behind him, the Emerald Directorate flag moved gently. The golden lion's head seemed to watch over them, a symbol of the strength that had built the first human city on the Moon. But Osram was no longer just theirs; the moon had become contested ground, with borders drawn by rival factions.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari felt Kofi's gaze pass over the assembly, pausing on him briefly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "But make no mistake," Kofi continued, his tone hardening. "The path ahead is full of challenges that would break lesser souls. The Imperium pushes at our borders. The Alliance schemes to undermine our sovereignty. And in the dark spaces between worlds, the Radi-Mons gather their strength."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Damn straight," Kwame's voice carried from somewhere to the right.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The holograms changed, showing recent footage from the frontlines. A Scarab mech fighting a twisted creature in a lunar crater. The flash of plasma weapons in space. The reality of what awaited them.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yet we stand undaunted," Kofi's voice rose with conviction. "For we are the Emerald Directorate, born from Africa's soil but embracing all who share our vision. From the Arabian Peninsula to the Pacific islands, from Central Asia to South America - we welcome those who seek a future free from both the Alliance's inequality and the Imperium's oppression."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He spread his arms wide, his ceremonial garments catching the light. "In our ranks, you'll find not just Africa's children, but people from all backgrounds. Through this unity, we forge a new path among the stars, guided by ancient wisdom but enriched by humanity's dreams."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Oguamtrani is always so good at speeches." Aisha muttered from behind.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Of course you'd say that. Your uncle's best buddies with him," someone replied.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "For real? That'd explain so much."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "No chatter during the speech. Or do you need 50 push-ups to remember that?" Sarge Keita cut in.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The chairman paused, his next words heavy with meaning. "And some of you will be called to face these challenges in ways few others dare. To venture into the darkest reaches, where honor and duty demand the highest price."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari's heart pounded. He knew what was coming.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Jabari Adomako," Kofi called, his voice filling the hall. "Step forward."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The walk to the podium felt endless. Jabari moved carefully, aware of every eye following him. The holograms changed, displaying his training records, combat scores, evaluations - his entire academic career floating above the assembly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Your instructors speak highly of your abilities," Kofi said as Jabari reached the podium. "Particularly your skill with Scarabs." A slight smile crossed the chairman's face. "Though I hear you had an...interesting final evaluation."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A few nervous laughs rippled through the crowd. Jabari's throat went dry, but he stood taller. "Yes, Oguamtrani."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Tell me, Cadet Adomako, what does fear mean to you?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The question caught him off guard. In the front row, he saw Sulayman watching intently. The words came to Jabari then, surprising even himself.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Fear is information, sir," he said, voice steady. "It tells us where our limits are - not so we can hide behind them, but so we know what we must overcome."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Eight years," Kofi Mensah said, studying Jabari. "That's how long you've trained for this moment. When Sergeant Keita first told me about a boy who threw himself at Radi-Mons with nothing but courage, I had my doubts."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The chairman's eyes gleamed. "But now, with the Moondust Crystal nearly within reach and war brewing across the Inner Sol, we need soldiers who remember why we fight. Who've seen what these monsters do to the innocent."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I remember, sir." Jabari's response was instant. "And I'd gladly bleed to put an end to the Radi-Mon menace."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Something shifted in Kofi's gaze - approval, perhaps. The chairman reached into his blazer and took out a gleaming beetle-shaped medal.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Kimaris Warband," Kofi announced, "has requested an officer with precisely this understanding." He held up the medal. "They seek not the fearless, but the courageous. Not the perfect, but the determined. Will you answer their call, Jabari Adomako?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The whispers started immediately. Kimaris. The cursed warband. The monster hunters. The ones who ventured into darkness that would break most soldiers.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   But Jabari felt something else now, replacing his earlier doubt. Purpose. Clarity. His voice rang out:
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I will, Oguamtrani!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kofi stepped down to where Jabari stood, the medal gleaming in his hands. "Then by my authority as Oguamtrani of the Emerald Directorate, I commission you as Lieutenant Jabari Adomako of the Kimaris Warband." The medal's weight settled against Jabari's chest as Kofi pinned it in place. "May you bring honor to the Directorate, and may your Scarab's steps shake the very foundations of our enemies!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Chairman's voice rose, addressing everyone once more. "With this appointment, Lieutenant Adomako also receives command of a personal Scarab mech, designation KM-233, now stationed in Hangar Bay Seven."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A hologram appeared above them - a massive war machine in Directorate green, its armor decorated with golden edges. Almost hidden in the patterns was a small emblem: a king protea in silver-white, its petals arranged in perfect symmetry. The Kimaris mark.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Use it well, Lieutenant. The darkness of the Five Realms grows deeper each day," Kofi declared.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Thank you, Oguamtrani." Jabari's fingers touched the medal, feeling its intricate beetle design. His earlier doubts seemed distant now, replaced by pride and purpose.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As he turned to face the graduates, he saw Captain Osei in the crowd. The officer gave him a slight nod. Beside him, Sulayman's scarred face broke into a smile.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The hall erupted in the traditional chant: "Unity! Strength! Directorate!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari stood straighter, the medal warm against his chest. He was Lieutenant Adomako now. And he had monsters to hunt.
  </span>
 </p>
