<p class="cnNiNzdlMzRlZGFmNTQ3YTE4YTIxYzVlN2I4NjgzY2Fi"><span style="font-weight: 400">To say that the evening was stressful would be an understatement.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMThjNDNlYjdiMjQxMzNiMWRkNmRlMjNhMzUyOTQ0"><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment I got home, I was assaulted by that giddy anticipation one has when waiting for a reply from their crush. At least that’s how I imagine it feels. It wasn’t pleasant in the slightest.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMWZmYmRiNjU5MTRhY2ZiMjQ0MmVlMmQ1MmY3NjY4"><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t like Futaba promised to contact me or anything like that. As far as I knew, she could just show up out of nowhere and erase my memories within a second if she deemed me a threat.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMTczMDVlZTM3ODQyZjZhMmEyNTJmZTI4MWQ1OGRk"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">But the fact that she left me her phone number means something… right?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnMxNzAyZTBiNTlkNjQ4MzE5MjJlZDZlOTBhYWViZjk4"><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, I didn’t think she left me with her contact just so I could pester her about Ayumi’s situation. In fact, pressuring her more would probably backfire.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NGZhZjQ0Y2M3NTQ0N2ZhZmFmMGRhYTdlMmE2Yjky"><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s how I found myself stuck in mental limbo. I wasn’t able to do much of anything except suffer for the rest of the day, checking and rechecking my phone like some dopamine addict. Eventually, I fell asleep from pure exhaustion.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDI5NGJmNGUyYTQwYzlhMjdhZDUyMjQ5YjAxY2Rj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Due to the poor sleep I had that night, I felt exceptionally groggy the next morning. While I was pondering whether to meet Shiina for lunch or not, I finally got the anticipated message on my phone.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhM2MwMmMyM2VjYjRiNzlhYzE1NmNmYWEwMjE4YmM3"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">I’ve got some important findings to share. Can we meet up at your place?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMDdhNzEwYzY3NTQ0ZWJiODBmZGE0YjE4NjYzNGNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Since she had already been to my house not too long ago, I didn’t bother questioning if she knew where it was.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MjljY2I2YWFmYzQ2M2M4NWU4NjBkN2U1NGZjOTJh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine,” I replied before putting on my uniform and waiting.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkODk4M2UyYjQxZDQ4M2M4ZDA1MWI3MmI1MjM5ODFk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Not even two minutes had passed when the doorbell rang.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNWY0MDk2MGE1NTRhZmVhMDVjZTQyNzJiY2VjNmUz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Morning, Takeya. Looks like I’m back here again!” My classmate, Kotori Futaba, said politely, as she bowed on my doorstep.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjRmMzZhMTcwMDQ2NTViOTVhNjdiMWM5YzUyMDg4"><span style="font-weight: 400">She was wearing a heavy coat on top of a turtleneck shirt, black shorts, tights, and a pair of sneakers. Despite her mundane smile, I could still feel a different vibe coming from her. It left me on edge.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYTQ5Y2RiNWRhNTRjNDA4YmM0YzVmNzU0ODU4NDVh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh… good morning to you too, Futaba. Seems like it, yes.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwN2UwNzY5NDIwODRkNTViNWNjOTIxMjFiOWM0YTVh"><span style="font-weight: 400">I led her to the living room and ventured to the kitchen to fetch some tea I had prepared beforehand. I was a bit nervous to find out what sorts of things Futaba had learned since yesterday. But that nervousness was overpowered by the realization that Futaba wasn’t a normal girl. She was an angel, capable of supernatural feats I couldn’t even comprehend. In fact, she could have easily come here just to erase my memories.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMTQ5YmMxNGUyNzRiNmViMDhjMWE1NDg0NWU0M2Nm"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s why, no matter how innocent she might look or sound, I can’t let my guard down.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNkNjA1NDVkMjQ5YjQ1YTQ4ZmNmMWE0MmUyMTY0MjFk"><span style="font-weight: 400">I returned to the living room, teacups in hand, to find the girl playing around with a certain item I had left there.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MzEzMGUwNWMzOTRmZmFiMTg4YjNmZjZkODQyODQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, I’m sorry I picked this up without asking,” she said with surprise as if she had been caught doing something naughty. “I thought this snowglobe was super adorbs, and I was curious since it wasn’t here the last time I dropped by.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NjgwYTA3MGI2MjQwNmE4MDQxZTY1ZjhhNmE3NjM5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, it’s fine, don’t worry,” I said as I handed her a teacup. “Yeah, this wasn’t supposed to be here in the living room. It’s mine, you see.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMjI4ODNkYjljMTQ1Zjc4NmVjZDQyNTVkNGM2ZGEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yours?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMmQ5Y2IxN2YxNDRhOWFiMzg4ZWIwM2U3NDIzZDdm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“My sister gave it to me a long time ago. I brought it down from my room earlier. It helps me… calm down sometimes.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOWMxNzIyYjE5NjRlN2VhNWUzZWI2YzI5M2Q0NjZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNGQ4OTA4OTU2YTQwZmViZDNmMDA2ZWM5MGJlNmZk"><span style="font-weight: 400">The way she said it made me feel reassured.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlY2U0YTkyYTUyYjQ2ZjJhYjAyODZjYjU0ZjBlYjlm"><span style="font-weight: 400">I sat down while Futaba took a sip of her tea. The very moment she placed her cup to the table, something changed—her entire aura shifted into something powerful and otherworldly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZDU1NjY5Y2ViYjRiN2I5NzhmZGE2NWM0N2Q1ZTQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, let us get right to business,” the angel said with an enigmatic smile.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZTQwYzhlNWFiYjQ2MTY5NTdiMTcyMjE4OTA0OGU2"><span style="font-weight: 400">This change was enough to spike my heart rate.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYTNmYzJiYTMzNjQ4M2VhYjg1MDNhYTQzNzg4YjBl"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Damn, her personality-switching ability is impressive. It’s like I’m speaking to a completely different person. Is she doing this on purpose?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnMwNDA1NmM0YTliZjQ4YmQ4ZjRlNTc0Njk0NWNhY2Ji"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">I bet she’s doing this on purpose.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNhM2NhOTEzYjMzMzQ5NjViZTczNzcxMzRjYmEyYmU5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Before anything else, let me apologize for the incident yesterday. In my haste, I did not realize you were directly in the path of that ball,” she said with a polite tone.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MjNiYWRiYWU2YTQ3Y2U5NGE3YmEzMTZjNzQ5NDcx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nah, don’t fret it. It wasn’t that serious.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNGQyYTdkODdiOTQ4NzdhNWIwMDYxYTA3Nzg3NTlm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, if all is okay on that front, let us discuss Ayumi’s situation…” I was so hesitant to hear what she had to tell me, I barely took notice of the slight pause in her speech. “I should be forthright with you before I proceed. I had significant doubts something like you described could have happened to Ayumi in the first place.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNmEyNGVhM2JkODQ0OTdiYmMzZjViYTEwMjUwNDQ1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I’m not at all surprised. That was a last-ditch attempt at getting some help. Honestly, I don’t even believe something supernatural could—”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NWMxNzQ2OGM5ZTRjMDQ5M2FlZGM0ZTRhNTA0YzFm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That is not what I am referring to,” she said, interrupting me.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MzJmZmJjM2M0MzQ2NzdhZTExMDkyNzJjMTliNWEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MmEwZmFlNDUyYjQ0ZjU5MGVmOTY2ZmQ2YjgxOWE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Takeya,” she said with authority. “The reason why I was placed at your school in the first place—it was to monitor Ayumi.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YzcxYmZkYjY1ODRmYjBhZWUyNmQzNjIwMGM2MjEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait, say that again? You were monitoring Ayumi?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZTkxZWE0NDYxZTQ3YzViODg3YjVhYWQyNWIxNTY2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. My mission was to survey her activities and report them to my superiors.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Mzg4NThjZmYzZjQ4MjJiMTM2Mzg3ODBkOGY5NGVk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait. Wait just a minute,” I said, although the girl was very much waiting already. “Why Ayumi? What possible reason could angels have to monitor her?” Then, I stopped myself. “Is it because we were getting too close to finding out about angels in the first place?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZmQyZDgzNmZhMzQwOTg5MTI4OWVmNzU3ZDVjM2Mw"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">What the hell. Does everything in this world revolve around her or something?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNkNmUyM2I3NWMwZDQ5OTliMjYzNTdmZjQ2N2U0ZDM1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, nothing of the sort. Sadly, I cannot answer your question, for I do not know the answer myself.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZTFjNDBhYWQwYTQyMWVhNWVlY2JiYWU0Y2U0OTU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You… don’t know?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNzY1OTUwZmZiNjQyOWQ5YWU4ODA3YzUwOTQyN2Qx"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">This is getting weirder and weirder by the second.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnM4MjQ0M2M4NjU2MzQ5N2JiYWZmZTYyMjY2NmIyYmEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Futaba appeared to be taken somewhat aback by my straightforward question. “Angels are not in the habit of inquiring about their missions. I merely did as I was told. However, I did report on Ayumi’s recent ‘field missions’, like your trip to the minka, but no order was given to act upon them. Which means that my superiors were not troubled about that, or else they intentionally chose not to have me intervene.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNTYwYzhiZDQ5NzQ5MjE4YzNlMzI1MDhlMjRjOGE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So you’ve been following us around?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxN2IzZWU2M2ZhNDRiZTZiNGUyNTRhYmRjNjE2N2U5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was supposed to. However, lately, there have been some… distractions.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMWMwYzIzMGE1ODQ3OGY5ZWVkN2YwMzhiODM0YzAw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Distractions?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1N2IyZTkyN2FhNDQyZTU4NTMyMzQ3NjFmMDY4OGQ1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You must have heard about them in class. The ‘supernatural incidents’.” </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh yeah, those…</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> “Their recent frequency is not normal, to say the least, so we have been swamped dealing with them. In normal circumstances, it is vanishingly improbable that Ayumi would interact with an angel without my knowledge. However, there have been enough blind spots that such an event could have happened. That is precisely why I took your request.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYjVjNmIyMTM5ZjQ3ODk4MDRhODAyMjYwZjMxZGMz"><span style="font-weight: 400">All this preamble already raised way too many questions, but I decided to refocus on the matter at hand.</span></p><span class="cmNhZTM5Njk0ODZiNzQ3YWE4ZTU4NGRmNThhMmNiODNh"><br/>This novel is published on a different platform. Support the original author by finding the official source.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM1ODBjNTkzMGQ3ZjRiZDU5YzNhNDg3NDZmYTMxYzRk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So? Did you, you know, take a look at her?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZjMwZDc2YTgxZjQzODRhNmU5YmRhY2ExNGE2ZjZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I found an opportunity to take a look at Ayumi when I was erasing her memories. However, the situation proved to be a bit more intricate than I had anticipated. That is why it took me so long to report back.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZDExYjJkM2QzNjRiZDE4YjJiZDJiZDhlYWM3M2Ux"><span style="font-weight: 400">Although her tone barely changed and her words were ambiguous, I got the impression that the situation was not only complex, but dire.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNGViYmU0NWFhYTQ5NGRhNGE2MDcxY2M1MGFmNWM3"><span style="font-weight: 400">The angel took another calm sip of her tea. “If I may be a bit blunt, Ayumi’s memories are </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">not normal</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MWI0YWJiOTY0YjQyYzI5OTRjMDRiOTNjNmRjYTZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? Not normal? What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNWU2ZGVmNjA5MzQ4ZDViNzM1YzA1MTUwNDA5NmIx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“An explanation is in order, I believe. Say, do you have a pen and paper at hand? It will be easier to explain that way.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNjIwN2NkMzk3YjQ4ZWVhMDk5ZTQ5ZjQ1MDdmMTA2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOGMxZDUwY2Y2YTRlYzk4N2FhNjAzM2UxYzM3MjE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">I went to fetch some black pen and a blank piece of paper from the entrance cabinet and gave them to Futaba. The girl drew two straight parallel lines on it.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOGJmZDczNjI1NTRlOWZhODQ2MGM3ZTVkY2RjMTE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“In normal humans, there are two types of memories, the surface layer and the deep layer.” As she spoke, she wrote “surface layer” above the top line and “deep layer” above the bottom line.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZjg0ODFmMTY2NTQxYTg5OTAyMjFkNWM2YzMxMWNm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The surface layer is a fallible and moldable interpretation of the person’s experiences. It is easily distorted and corrupted. When angels modify or erase memories, this is where they act. The deep layer, however, remains beyond our influence. In it, every aspect of a human’s conscious experience since birth is recorded without any filters.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MGM5M2M0YWE4YjQ3YmNiZmMzMzIyY2IyZGFiYjZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“When angels erase or fabricate memories, we are manipulating the surface layer. We can even alter it in such a way that the human’s imagination will construct a false memory from a simple core impression. Something like this.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Mjc4ZDY1ZTM5ZDQ4NTQ5ZTViYTgwMTAzNTgwNmY5"><span style="font-weight: 400">She put her index finger on the top line, the so-called “surface layer” and, like magic, a piece of the line </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">changed color</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> from black to blue.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MWI1NTE5YjQ3YzQ5OWM5ZWNjMmEwNWI4ODQ3NGRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Woah!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDdlNDRjZGI4MzRiZDI4NjZkZjdhYTE3M2RiZmY5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So we modify the memory, changing it from ‘black’ to ‘blue’. Do you get it so far?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZmNkMWIwNjdhNDQ3NzdhZmQ4YWJjOWMyNzNmZDY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I think I do.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDg2NTI0Yzc1NDQ4OWJiNzIyNDY4Nzc3NzU5NjQy"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, I’m still reeling from that magic trick.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNmM2RkNTAyOTkxMTQ4MTRhMDc0ZWZlM2U3MWQxMjZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now then, with that background established, I can explain the problem with Ayumi’s memories. In essence, they are a patchwork of modifications to her surface layer. Her deep layer is almost absent.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MGViNGU0MWE2NjQ0OWFiZGU1MmY5ODU4YzY1OTUz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Once again, she directed my attention to the two lines on the paper. This time around, she touched the top line, turning it blue. Then she touched the bottom line and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">swung pieces of it off the paper. </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">What resulted was the top line being entirely blue and the bottom line being filled with holes.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZmEyMDA1NTA5YzQ3MDNiNDY5MzA1MWVlMzliYmQ0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Probably sensing my confusion, the angel summed up her explanation to a single shocking sentence.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MzUzOGRkYjU2NTQ4ZDI5NzkzMDU5OWM3ZWYzNDky"><span style="font-weight: 400">“In other words, almost all of Ayumi’s memories are a fabrication.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNmI1MTcyNjkwODQyZTM5NjYwNGRjMWYwOTk3Yjg1"><span style="font-weight: 400">My mind spun, and I felt my heart drop a million miles. “Hold on, how’s that possible?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMjNmZGYzN2M0OTQ4Y2NhZDVkZmU4NmQ1YjBkODdk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Only after asking that question did I disarm the angel.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NWM2MGI2M2Y4YTRmNTdhOTMzNGVjZjAzZjIyYTli"><span style="font-weight: 400">“To be frank, I have no clue. I have never encountered a situation like this before. The only explanation I can offer for the absence of a deep layer is by a complete lack of consciousness, like a comatose state. However, Ayumi has been leading a normal life for as long as I have been monitoring her, so that cannot be the case.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YjE1ZTM3ODkwZDQwNzU5NWNlYzg0MDI0YzcwOGQ0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So is that why I noticed something weird with her? Someone replaced the real Ayumi with this fake and implanted memories into her?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmM2YxMGYwYjg4MTQ5MzY4NWY5NDc2NTBiMjBiMGNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It is a stretch, but I cannot rule that possibility out. Having no original memories is irrelevant in her day-to-day life. She might have some difficulty in recalling certain events with clarity, but that is the extent of it.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNTk1NjVjM2JmMjQ3YWY5MTU5NTVhNzllOTg3ZWUw"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">So that explains why she had trouble remembering stuff during this last week.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnMzNjcwMGU2NjU0OTRhNTI4M2NjZTBjOGU2OTQ1YTg0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So that’s it? We’re stumped? Will we ever figure out what’s wrong with Ayumi?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YzQ2MDIyYTlkNzQzMzg4ODVjMzMzOWVjNDYzNTZk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not exactly. I did find a few more clues.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNDVlN2Q3N2QxYzQzZTNiNjJmYWRlMjk3YWE0ZTA1"><span style="font-weight: 400">I urged her to continue, which she did after another sip of her tea.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZWEyZWFiNmFmMjQ2MDhiYTVkODQ0OGFhNjQ3ZTRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Her deep layer is not </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">entirely</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> devoid of original memories. Approximately every three months, I discovered a few fragments. Unfortunately, most of them were created when she was asleep, rendering them useless to us. That said, I could only find thirty-four of these fragments and nothing prior to that. That means Ayumi’s memories only extend back to around—”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOTBhNzU1MjRhYTRlMDQ5OGM0MTBhMWM5ODA3ZjA3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eight years ago,” I said, interrupting the angel.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NWU0YjI1MzA5YjRlM2NhMGZjYzU0YzNhMzlkMzI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">She raised an eyebrow in surprise.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZWNkYmRmMzYwMTQwNGViOTU5NjQ4YWM1YWI1NDcx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eight years and six months, to be exact. As I recall, that coincides with how long you two have known each other for, correct?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMjI4NDgyNGY3YzQ2NjRiM2UxZTI4ZjAxNzllODI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded in agreement.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MDViZTY0YmFhMzQ3MTI5ZmYyMTAyN2YzNTE0OThl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Eight years and six months.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZDJhNzUxYjlmNzQ0MmNhYjk2ODc5ZjZkNGIxYWM4"><span style="font-weight: 400">The day I met Ayumi flashed back in my mind. Even if the current Ayumi isn’t the real deal and the real one has memories before that, there’s no way those two dates are a coincidence.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OWRkYmM5NzA5YjQ0NzU5ODcyY2MyMjQyMmFiMDJi"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">But what could all this mean?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnM4OTAyYzUwODllNjRhNDNiZWQ5OTNmOGE2YTZmMjlh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Without giving me time to think further, the angel continued her exposition.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNGEyMDY2ZDY1MDRiODk4MTc3M2ZjOTYxMmFkMjY1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is not the only peculiar aspect I found. Her deep layer has been perfectly normal since last Sunday evening. Using the coma analogy, it is like she awoke from her coma that evening and has been living a normal life ever since. However, just before her deep layer becomes normal, there is a distinct gap in her surface layer of a few hours.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ODIwM2M4M2U1NzQzNTE5MGFhYzQ3YzM5NzVlMzMy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait, a gap?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YTYxNDZmNTFlNTRkZWViMDhjYzBlOTUwOGI1ZTFk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“My conclusion is that someone erased her memories for that period.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NzlkMzM4ZWM0ZTRmYzc4YzllYjcyNDJiOGQ3MmZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Erased? So that means she met an angel last Sunday?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MjI2MmNmZjI2ZDRjOWU5ZTVlNGMyZGZkYjVhOWU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“In all likelihood, yes.” The angel paused. “However, if it was an angel, then their work was particularly rushed or… sloppy.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OGQ3M2VlNzgxMzRlN2FiODAwMjQ2OTg3NzUwOGNh"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s a particularly unrefined word coming from her.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnM2OTA2MjJlNDlmNTQ2MjM4OTc5YzNhNmUxMWMyNzFm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No angel skilled in their craft would erase only the surface layer, even if they were in a rush. We always leave some sort of impression to facilitate the creation of a false memory. Otherwise, if the person attempts to remember those memories, they would turn up blank, and it would lead to confusion. My only explanation is that this was the work of an amateur.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMjFlODczMWMxMjQ3ODViZDRmYmFlNTZmNWUzZDcx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even angels have amateurs in their ranks?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYThiOTU1YmI5ZTRhY2E4ODIzMjUwMDcyYTI3OTUz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, but I can only think of a few scenarios where she could have met one; none of which are very probable. This situation is unprecedented, even for me</span></p>
<p class="cnNhODdmY2ZkMDQ1MjQwZTViODZlOTM3MTFjNTc1YTVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, what can we do? All we have is a theory that an amateur angel erased her memories. This says nothing about what happened to the real Ayumi.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZTMzMDE1NjllYzQzMzQ5ZTg2YWE3MzczNmZlZjI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We are not exactly out of clues yet,” she replied with a hint of a smile on her face. “I am aware that the two of you have been going around angel-hunting for a while now.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOTRiZGY0NGRmMDQ0Zjg5OTJlYmYyMzE4YWRkYjUz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Though she said it with a somewhat casual tone, I couldn’t help but detect some amusement peppered in there.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMzg1MzdhMDgzMTRhMjA4N2UzZjU5NzNmMDdkZTU0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s Ayumi for you,” I replied, trying to evade the question.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMzcxMDM0YmNmNDQzNTBhODkwMzZlYjU5ZWM1YzU0"><span style="font-weight: 400">She smiled back at me.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZjJhZGM4NDAyNzRiMzU5ZTQwZjUwODI1NDdmOTM5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“However, Ayumi has a conspicuous lack of memories in crucial moments throughout the last few weeks. The logical conclusion is that, by some miracle, you encountered an angel—albeit an amateur one—and Ayumi had her memories erased as a result.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZjY1NmYwZjA2OTQ2Mjk4NjRkOGVhMWFmMTM0ZTJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Pausing to take the last sip of her tea, Futaba returned to me with a question.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NWJhODcxMDQ0YTQyYzJiZTM5NzQ4ZThhNzMxZWIy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, Takeya. I wager you were with Ayumi that evening. Do you have any recollection of what happened last Sunday evening or anything before that that might relate to angels?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMjg2NDBiZTQ4MzRlZDRiOTI3M2M4OTdlYzdmMDgy"><span style="font-weight: 400">I was about to reply, but when I tried thinking back to that day, my mind went blank. No matter how much I rummaged through my memories, there was nothing there.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMjZlYTk0MzhmZjRjMjg4ODJmNjkwYWVhNjg5NmY5"><span style="font-weight: 400">The more I tried to, the more I became aware that the memories were probably my imagination rather than actual memories.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOTJhODM4NjQ2NDQzOTBiN2NiZThhZmFlM2QwM2U5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I can’t remember anything,” I said defeatedly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4M2IyOWIwYjFlYzQzOWU5YzdlN2JjYzMxNjIwMmVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am sorry to hear that. Had this been the work of a competent angel, you would not have endured such trauma… However, all hope is not lost. If you do not suffer from the same condition as Ayumi, then I will be able to recover your deep memories, which should shed a light on what transpired a week ago.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMzFjZmUxNzg2NTRhNTA5ODk5YmI5NjYzMWY0YjZh"><span style="font-weight: 400">The angel’s unspoken request was clear, but it still made me hesitate. After all, who would willingly let a paranormal being mess with their memories like that?</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNjk4NDlmYWY3YjQwZmZiNWZmMzkwOTJkYzIzYzAw"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">But still, that is the only hope I have. If I am the key to solving this crisis, then I will gladly bare it all for Ayumi… That thought sounded much weirder than I expected.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNlOGFmY2FmYjczZDQzNzA4ZWIyNTYxYWU0YmUxMTJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay, Futaba. If that’s the way to solve this, then you are welcome to poke around.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZmJjMDNkMmFlYTQ2MmU5OTAzMDM4ODYyOTM0YTM1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you, Takeya,” she said as she stood up to stand next to my chair. “I will place my hands on your head, read your memories, and return them simultaneously, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NThhNjliNjJlZjQ3NzViY2QyZDk4OTdjZWYyOTdl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Giving my approval with a nod, the angel did just as she described.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZDIyYjk2OTA1NjQ4ZWZhNDY5MjMzNTBmMzI4MDk1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Relax. This will not take long,” Futaba said in a calming voice.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMjM3OTZkNWUyNTQyYmFhODZmODQyNzM4YWM3NTJl"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s kind of impossible to relax in this situation, you know.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnM5YzQwMmIzNTI1MDQ0Y2ZhYmY3OTNlYjFmY2Q2NGU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">I did my best to release all the tension from my body, and closed my eyes. After all, staring at the midriff of my classmate while she had her hands on my scalp wasn’t exactly relaxing.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhM2ZlZWIyZTVkMjQzYjhiYWRmYTE5OTg4NDlkNzBk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, those frivolous thoughts faded into darkness. For a while, I saw nothing and thought nothing.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMjEyMmExYmEwNTQzZDhiNzk0NDlhMzVlNGYyYTlm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, all at once, a flood of memories invaded my consciousness. There were thoughts and emotions that felt foreign, yet familiar at the same time.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OGQ5Zjk1YTU3MTQzNDA5NTZhMDYxNDE5YmQ1ODAw"><span style="font-weight: 400">They invaded my mind so violently that I thought I was going to break.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNWQ3NGU0OTZlZTQ1NDFhMzI4NmEzMTUzN2NmZTRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">The incident in the other city.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MGQ1ZWQ3NWZmYjQ2MGZiZDE2N2I5MmM3MmMxZTEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Stalking Shiina until we found out where she lived.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZDVhOGI4YmM3MDRjYzk5NjgzZTdiYWVkNzNlNDk0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Meeting the angel in that innocuous street.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwY2ViMWRlM2MxYzQzNWNiYTgyMDhjOWY5NzE3NjA5"><span style="font-weight: 400">The conversation in that park.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZjNjYTYwMWVhNTQxNWNiZDc0ZWE3MmM0NzdiMzYx"><span style="font-weight: 400">And Ayumi’s revelation that she wasn’t a normal human, which had been interrupted by the archangel.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZDQxYTM0YjRlZDQ2NWRhNTQyNGM5NzgxNTVmNzNm"><span style="font-weight: 400">When the incoming information finally stopped flowing, my brain was overwhelmed. I had trouble forming complete thoughts. As the pieces came together, that feeling that something was amiss, the phantom who followed me throughout the week, had vanished.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MGMwZDAxMzAwMjRkNjNhOTgwMTY4NzFkYjExYzVm"><span style="font-weight: 400">And in the wake of its dying breath, I remembered everything.</span></p>
