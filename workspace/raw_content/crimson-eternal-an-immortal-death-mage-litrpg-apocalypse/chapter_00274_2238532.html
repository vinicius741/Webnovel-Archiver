<p class="cnNkMzVlMDQzMDU5YTQ3MjA4Y2FmMzU3NzRjNDJmMWM0" style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 1.1em"><strong>Aria</strong></span></p>
<p class="cnM0MDRjODY2M2FjOTQ4Y2Q5ZDY3NmM0MzU2ODg2NGEy">I stare at the keypad on the panel with a rather dead look in my eyes after an entire month of spamming different numbers on it. With none of them working at all, and there being so many more potential passwords that I swear it’ll take me at least a decade to get through them all.</p>
<p class="cnNjZWJhODhkYjJmNDRiY2Q4MjQ1NzBjMmZiZGJiYWFl">Because the stupid fucking thing has several different passwords required, each of which have dozens of digits required within the password.</p>
<p class="cnM5M2NhZmY0MTdjODQ0MmJiY2ViYzIzNGU1NWFkNTcw">The whining of babies makes my ear twitch once before one of the Death Spirits I had take care of them quickly gets to work dealing with the babies. Which, out of the corner of my eye, I see as them changing one of the babies’ diapers.</p>
<p class="cnMzZmQwYzY0ZGI2YzQ1MjdhY2E1NTk4ODM1ZDFkOGQ2">I let out a sigh again, only to turn around and head back to the locked room. Calling it a night for today.</p>
<p class="cnNhYmMzMjBmZjZjNjQ2MzY4ZWNkN2QzODI0MGM4N2Jh">And the instant I do, the girl – whose name I found through journals was Ruby – immediately follows after me with more strength than a seven month old should be able to muster. Meanwhile the boy of the twins – Ryan – begins to make a fuss while the Death Spirit is busy changing his diaper. Likely wanting to follow as well.</p>
<p class="cnNjYmYyZGFlOTUwZjQyNzVhNTM1MDIwOTE5YjBmZDZl">Because for some reason these twins have been practically attached to me at the hip when I’m not anywhere near the traps in the place.</p>
<p class="cnNhMzQxM2ZjM2VjMDRjYmNiNTdlNjZiYzlhZWQ1OWM5">And while the kids are cute, it’s kind of annoying.</p>
<p class="cnM1NmVhZTFlNzBjNzQzMThiNjc0NzU0NTgwYzdhZDk1">But at the same time, I’d never hurt them in any way, and they’re not really doing anything other than being clingy.</p>
<p class="cnMxMWE0YjgyMDU4ZjQyMDY4MTBiZWNjZTlhODM1ZTc1">So it’s fine.</p>
<p class="cnNmODE3NjI4NmNkNDQ2MDBhOGY0MjZhMzE4NjQyMDVm">Besides. I’ll probably be finding some family to take care of them after I finally leave this planet anyways.</p>
<p class="cnM1NzA4ZDU3MDllMzQ2Njk5YTY0NmQ5ODM0ZTNlNjgz">When I get back to the little nursery room, I go ahead and sit on the bed I dragged from one of the other rooms that didn’t have a lock. Then I go ahead and read as Ruby finds herself stuck at the foot of the bed, not able to get up.</p>
<p class="cnNjMDA3MWI1NjE0ZjQwZGU4MWJmMjdiMzE1Mjc0YzNk">And not even five minutes later, Ryan ends up in the same place.</p>
<p class="cnNjMTI3YTM4NmI0MzQ5NzI4MzRjYzQyMDU2NjZlZDBh">With both of them just looking up at me from the ground as I lie against some pillows with my ebook reader in hand.</p>
<p class="cnNiYTA2ZWFlZDE0ZDRhZGE5YWZiNDViMTFmMDM0MGU2">And they keep on staring for half an hour before I finally give in and order a Death Spirit to pick them up and put them on the bed. If for no other reason than to stop them from staring.</p>
<p class="cnNjMWZhMjk3NTllZjRjZTU5MTgyYTBjMTNjODU3MGRk">At which point they immediately just grab ahold of me and close their eyes. Seemingly falling asleep immediately with Ruby holding onto my stomach and Ryan onto my thigh.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZmMxNDJlYmM1NDQ5MGFiMTFjZThhZmExNDI1OGUx">I let out another sigh.</p>
<p class="cnMwODk0ODZiNWQzYjQyZTdhNjMzZTg5OWVmZmI3N2Ex">What the hell is happening here…</p>
<p class="cnMyNjU2MmE1OTVhZjQ2OTk5YWNmOWMzMzg5ZTdmNzhh">The last time I checked I wasn’t a mother, nor was I anywhere near a mother figure.</p>

<p class="cnM0MDc3ZjY4MmQ0ODQyNzM5ZTlmNTQxNGNjYzg0Mjk1">“Maaamaa!” Ruby suddenly says as I pass by her heading back to the nursery room from my latest failed attempts at cracking the password. And her word makes me freeze stiff for a very brief second as the now-12-month-old girl chases after me, still with surprising physical ability for her age.</p>
<p class="cnNhNTYyZmZmYWQ3NzQ5OTI5ZjBjMjU5YTM5MGE1MTRi">I glance down at the girl as she grabs onto my calf and looks up at me while seemingly trying and failing to repeat what she just said.</p>
<p class="cnM1NGM4NDUyNDExYzQ2NmE5Y2Y1NjFlNjA0YWFmOGI5">Did she just…</p>
<p class="cnM0ZDA3NDk5OTc0NDQzNzQ5NTQ1MGQ0M2M4MjU2ZDcy">“Mammam!” I hear Ryan exclaim as he chases after, having once again been getting his diaper changed by a Death Spirit. Something I’ve noticed happens quite a bit more often than Ruby, who is actually surprisingly starting to learn to go to the bathroom on her own now. Even though I only taught her once because she insisted on following me.</p>
<p class="cnMyZDY1NWFiNmUwNTRmMWZhZTNlZTAxZjIxODQxNTc3">And the Death Spirits can’t exactly teach that.</p>
<p class="cnNjMTQyYjI4ZjE3ZDRlZjA5MTY1MWNmNzExNmI3Njgy">I rub my temples despite not being able to have headaches as I contemplate what’s become of my life.</p>
<p class="cnNlYWVlMjczZDhkMTRlYWI5YTUzZmQwM2U4YWFmMWIw">Please just let me…</p>
<p class="cnNkYzMwNDVjN2Y3NzRkMzI5MzNmODczOTI3NWQ5OGM1">My eyes stray to the kid holding onto my leg and the other one chasing after me for a moment.</p><span class="cjk0OWNlNmQwMGNjYjQ3NzQ4MjcxMmNlODhiMjgxZDQ2"><br/>Enjoying the story? Show your support by reading it on the official site.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNhNGY2YjExMTdkZjQzNzRhOTg1MTUyNDM5YmFlYTgx">Yeah, just let me finish up here so I can get back to my normal life please.</p>
<p class="cnM2MDI0MzViZTQxYjQzYTRhMTAxZGIzODgzYmY5MjZj">I sigh again, not bothering with correcting them since they clearly won’t understand me.</p>
<p class="cnMzM2IwN2NlODFhMTQ2ZTg4YTI5Y2U1N2E0NTc5NjM3">Although how the hell they managed to learn that word in the first place is beyond me.</p>
<p class="cnMxYzMxYzFiODY1MDQ3NTM4OTFjNDU4NmU3MjlhMWQy">Considering how little I’ve spoken here.</p>
<p class="cnNlYWE5ZmYyMTRiODQ4M2I5NGY2ZGNhZTYyMjhiNjlj">And with that thought in mind, I continue walking over towards the nursery again. Only briefly pausing to pick up the two kids and bring them with me.</p>
<p class="cnMxNDVhYjkzNTMwZTQ0N2RiMzQxMTBiNjZhZDVmZDUy">Since they keep getting in the way when they grab onto my legs.</p>
<hr/>
<p class="cnNmM2JiNjViNDBiNDRjMjQ4YzlmOTJmZmViZWVmNjg5" style="text-align: center"><strong><span style="font-size: 1.1em">Aria</span><br/><em>Six months later, when the twins are 1.5 years old</em></strong></p>
<p class="cnMwZmI4NWRkYzY3YzRiZTc5MDA5OTBhZGJmODI4ODA2">“Mom. Food.” Ruby says from the other side of the room as I continue trying to crack the code. After which I go ahead and give the Death Spirit an order to go get their food. All without me actually looking back at them.</p>
<p class="cnM4MDk1ODYwNWRlOTRmMTFhMjUwZjE3NDVhMjc3ODgz">I still haven’t made much of any progress with this stupid password, and I can’t leave the planet either thanks to that barrier which has only grown stronger since I arrived. Making it so I can’t even get to my ship or call down a shuttle.</p>
<p class="cnM3MjgzNmQzMzEwZDQ3ZDI5YmE1NzRkNDU5YjkxZDhh">So I’m stuck here completely until I turn off whatever is making that barrier.</p>
<p class="cnNhZWU5NDcyOWQxZTRlNWU4M2U3NzhhNjI5MGQ5MjQw">Which I’ve found from clues hidden around the facility happens to be inside of this very treasury.</p>
<p class="cnMyNDc0Njk1NDlhNTQ5NzY4OWMyYWQwNjY3YTAyYTc0">It’s just plain annoying.</p>
<p class="cnMzOGNjODE3YzBkYjQ4YTY4ZDNiMGJhZDMyMjMzZTQy">As for the twins? They have been growing up at a rate that I think is faster than regular humans. Sort of.</p>
<p class="cnM2OWJjOTBiNTVlMzRiZDc4OWU2NTRjMWY2NWYxYzFk">Their actual sizes and ages seem to match what I assumed was normal for humans. But their muscular strength and intellect seems to be stronger than the average baby.</p>
<p class="cnM4Mjg1NWY1NmJjODQ3NmU5NTI0OTdkNDI5Y2E5MjQz">Or are they toddlers now?</p>
<p class="cnM3ZjcyMWFmNTYzZjQ3MDliZmUzYzc0ZTYwN2Q3Mzli">Not sure.</p>
<p class="cnNhMzNhYjk0Y2YwZTQwNWRiNzk5OTVlOTk0MWZkYmRh">“Momma, play!” Ryan exclaims as he no doubt is sitting next to Ruby. With the boy fortunately having learned how to go to the bathroom himself. Albeit a lot later than his sister.</p>
<p class="cnM5YjRkYWQ4MjNkODRiOTNhMDgwNGIwYTk1NGZlOTc1">Actually, he seems to be a bit slower than his sister in figuring things out.</p>
<p class="cnNjNWExNmM3MTk2ODRlMTI5M2M5NjY2MDI2MDk3MGFk">He also seems to be more talkative and childlike than her.</p>
<p class="cnM0YzYzMzU3MmZkOTQ3MjNiYjBiYjY5NWNmZDBkOWQ4">Ruby is quieter and speaks more clearly and in shorter sentences, even if she’s even clingier than he is. Meanwhile he speaks in a way that feels more normal of a child his age.</p>
<p class="cnMxNmM1MmMzMzFlZjQ1ZTg5ODFmMGY1YTNkZTlhMmRk">Something else I’ve found out in this time though is that they can eat actual mana creature meat. Probably because they’re werewolves.</p>
<p class="cnMxYjE3ZjA1N2ViYTQ1NzViZmRlNDMwNmMwOWRkYTIx">Good thing too, since I found that out after running out of the milk that was stored here.</p>
<p class="cnM0MTgzMzRkMDZmYjQyNjc4YWQ5YzQyNjYwYjA4OGJj">And I don’t exactly have any milk to give them.</p>
<p class="cnM2MTA0YTg3OTk5ODQ2MmY4Y2I0NzhiYjBjY2ZiMjAz">Or food at all, to be honest.</p>
<p class="cnNjNjNjNjc5OGQ5NTQwNDhhMTQ0ODlkNjY5N2FmNmVi">Seeing as I don’t eat.</p>
<p class="cnM4YTE3YzBiOWQ3NjQ2MzViOWNmN2M0NjA2NjUzY2Y2">I do have plenty of wine though. But that’s probably a bad thing to give to toddlers.</p>
<p class="cnNmYWM4MzViMWM1ZjRmMDA5NTljNjYzZTQ1ZDY4ZmRk">Overall, I’ve gotten rather used to the twins. Especially since the Death Spirits handle everything for them without me. Other than their clinging to me and all.</p>
<p class="cnNlNGEwMDNlMDUyMjRiZjZhYmZhYzJiMDhjOWU1YjM5">I have to focus on my password cracking after all. So I can finally get out of this place.</p>
<p class="cnM0OThkMWUyOTJiZDQzYThiMWFmMmVjNjZiNGZiNmRh">A faint smile stretches across my face again as a level-up notification appears in my vision. Albeit one without a skill to come with it.</p>
<p class="cnNhOGVkMjQ1MThhYzQ3Y2U4NWIwNmVhZTM2ZGQyMTBm">Well, now I’m level 121 and still no new skill.</p>
<p class="cnM4MmZhNmEwM2FlZTRmYmY5OGNhMmVkYjk2ODk3MGYz">Hopefully I’ll get another skill when I reach level 125.</p>
<hr/>
<p class="cnNkNmEzNTAxNzMxYjQ2MTNiYjNhY2NmOTc1NDI2OWYy" style="text-align: center"><strong><span style="font-size: 1.1em">Aria</span><br/><em>Three and a half years later, when the twins are 5 years old</em></strong></p>
<p class="cnM1ZjYwYjZiZmFjZjQ0MGFhZGI5NTFkZThkMDQwMzk1">“Mom, how long are you messing with this?” Ryan asks as he sits on a chair with his elbows on his knees and his chin held in both of his hands.</p>
<p class="cnMwNGIyZDQyMTdiMDRkOWM4ZWM3ZThmNWY5NDBmMjc5">“You mean ‘how long are you going to be messing with this,’” Ruby corrects him, the girl sitting on a chair next to him reading a book on a spare ebook reader I had on hand.</p>
<p class="cnMxNmY2MzhlNjI3MjQ1NDg5OWM3NjRiZjQzMmRiYTg2">I glance back at the two of them, both of whom have grown quite a bit in the years I’ve been here. Which really puts into perspective the years that have passed. Since I usually just get lost into the years without paying much attention.</p>
<p class="cnMyZjg2NjIzNmJiMDRjMWJhNGQ4ZjM0MjIyZjU3MDdk">But when these two are rather obvious displays of the passing time? I can’t exactly do that.</p>
<p class="cnMwOWVlOWI5MWEyYzRlMDA5ZTg0MWI3OGZiMDNiNmE2">Of the two, Ruby is the taller one by a little bit and is still the more mature of the two. Whereas Ryan is maturing emotionally and intellectually a little bit slower than her. Albeit still faster than most humans would, if I had to guess.</p>
<p class="cnM3MjVhOWE2YmFjYjQ4NmZiMjZlOTU5YzlkNTNhZDBk">Ruby has long black hair now with that same red highlight going down it, whereas Ryan has black hair that is about two to three inches long and with his same blue highlight. With it layered so that it’s a bit longer in the front and sides than the back.</p>
<p class="cnNlZjlkZDI4MWIzMTRkNDhiNDAxNmQ0NTE3Y2Q2OTZi">Additionally, Ruby tends to look rather uninterested in most things unless she’s hugging onto me. Which she still does. And even then she just gets a look of satisfaction on her face.</p>
<p class="cnM1NTk5ZThiMThmMDQwODZhZDk0ZTE0ZGU0OWIyZjg3">Ryan, on the other hand, is a rather happy fella. Always running around when his twin lets him. Not that she lets him do that very often. And he often smiles.</p>
<p class="cnNmN2ZhMDI4ZmEyOTRkYWY4ZWZkYTJmNzZjMWQyZjlj">I focus on the panel again as I answer, “Until I crack this password and can get inside the vault.”</p>
<p class="cnNhZjRjZWI4MTdkMzQyYzI4MmU2YjY5M2FiYzM2ODMx">Was honestly wondering how long it would take the two to ask this question.</p>
<p class="cnNkYjkxY2Q0YWMwZTRhNDA4OThmNWRjOGYwZTEyNzY1">They were bound to ask it at some point after all.</p>
<p class="cnM1OTI3ODZhZGM5YzQzNDdiNWZlMDBiODYwNjUyM2Y5">But it doesn’t really matter in the end. Not when I’m still planning on leaving them with someone else.</p>
<p class="cnM0YTJmOWNhOTg1ZDQwZWNiYzdmYWVjMTJjNmVmM2Zi">I tried to fix their way of referring to me at some point, but all I managed to do was to get them to call me Mom instead of Mommy or Momma. Which isn’t much different.</p>
<p class="cnMzZWQ3Y2JjNmIyNTQzYmVhZjYwYWYyZGUxZWRiOWI3">They’ll just have to adapt when they go to live with someone else.</p>
<p class="cnNiM2RjY2FmMzQ0ODRjMWY4ZDdhYTEyMTRlNTZhYmE4">I continue working on cracking the password for the next few hours before something begins to feel wrong.</p>
<p class="cnNiYTQzYWI1NzY4OTRkZDBiNWQ3NjQyZDRhNzQxMzA4">So wrong that I look away from the panel at the kids, only to realize they’re not there.</p>
<p class="cnMwYTJiMDI4NWUzMzRjNGU5Y2UwMmMxNmNkMmQ3MGY0">At which point I realize what’s wrong as I feel a strange pit in my chest. Something I recognize as worry.</p>
<p class="cnM1NDk3MTZlMDg1ZDRkNTM4MjVlOWQ3YWI4Y2I4NDY4">But… why would I worry about them? I’ve only known them for a few short years, and they’ve barely even been able to speak for most of those…</p>
<p class="cnM2ZGNkZDUwMzUzYjQwYjU5NGE2MjRiMjE5NDE4M2Ni">Despite my thoughts, I find myself climbing to my feet and quickly heading into the open hallway to look for them.</p>
<p class="cnNjZTM2MzBlNTZhODQwMTliYjc4YjgyZDM5NTczNDlm">Just to find Ruby trying to drag Ryan back here without me doing anything.</p>
<p class="cnNhY2I2NWRiMzU5MjRmZGZhMjNlY2ViMDIwOWYyZjc4">I feel a wry smile trying to push its way onto my face at the sight. One that doesn’t go away even when the twins notice me and begin to look a little awkward.</p>
<p class="cnMwZGM0OTg1OTZhZTQwNDJiOGE5NzRlYzgwYWIzZjJk">Then I walk up to them and pick them both up into my arms and bring them into the nursery room while saying, “Let’s get something to eat.”</p>
<p class="cnNhNTY2YjcxZGQ5YjRhYjJiMWYxNjhkZGRjY2IxYjAx">Both kids’ faces light up at that.</p>
