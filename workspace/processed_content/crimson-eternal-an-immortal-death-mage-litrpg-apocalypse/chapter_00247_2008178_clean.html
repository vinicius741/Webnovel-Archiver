</p>
<p>
  I smile as I watch TV in a random cavern of the Endless Glacier closest to the capital. Just sitting high above the cavern filled with monsters and my own Death Spirits. Not to mention the occasional other hunter who happens to pass through looking rather confused.
 </p>
<p>
  It’s been a good five years since I arrived on this world, and it only took Shirogane a good month to get back to me with a router that can connect through the Hunter’s Spot here. Which was a very short period of time to develop a new product like this. So I’m happy.
 </p>
<p>
  Of course, I’m using headphones with my TV. Because of a certain dragon that likes to chase after me whenever it gets near and hears me. And at one point it started linking the sounds coming from the TV to me somehow.
 </p>
<p>
  Not sure why that dragon is so pissed.
 </p>
<p>
  All I did was blow up its den and steal all of its horde.
 </p>
<p>
  I yawn as I finish the last episode of this action drama TV show. Then I stretch a bit and look down at one of my many Death Spirit armies slaughtering the mana creatures below. Only to stiffen up slightly when said dragon enters the cavern and starts throwing a fit.
 </p>
<p>
  I quickly gather up my TV and other stuff inside of my storage ring before making a swift exit out of this cavern to enter another. Where I remake my setup and start lying down to read this time instead.
 </p>
<p>
  Such an annoying dragon.
 </p>
<p>
  It was worse when I had two dragons on my tail instead of one though. But that second dragon was killed by the first when they met.
 </p>
<p>
  I later learned from the king that the dragons are territorial. So the first dragon probably sees me as its prey and doesn’t want anyone else taking me.
 </p>
<p>
  That or it considers me as part of its horde, considering how it stuck me in there as a frozen statue. But I’d rather not consider that option.
 </p>
<p>
  On another note, this world has been incredibly good to me in terms of leveling up. Since there are
  <em>
   a lot
  </em>
  of mana creatures flooding these Endless Glaciers. Not to mention that war, which gave me quite a few as well. Albeit nowhere near as many as these Endless Glaciers that I’m just sending waves of Death Spirits through.
 </p>
<p>
  So in just five years here I got more progress to my purpose than I did in four times that long on other worlds.
 </p>
<p>
  As if on cue, another level-up message plays out in my head and vision.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   [User has met the requirements to reach level 93. User’s level has been updated to level 93. New requirements to reach level 94 are as follows: 0/4000000 beings have been granted Death.]
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  I’m getting really close to my goal. And in just a few years at that.
 </p>
<p>
  Although part of it is probably because I’ve been focusing entirely on leveling up during this time. Far more than before.
 </p>
<p>
  I’m using a lot more Death Spirits, arming a lot of the Death Spirits with explosives to kill off the icy mana creatures here, and pretty much tearing this poor Hunter’s Spot apart. Which has been making a lot of people avoid this particular place.
 </p>
<p>
  The king has been rather happy though. Since it made it so that fewer mana creatures would leak out of the Endless Glacier.
 </p>

<p>
  A problem some Hunter’s Spots on certain worlds actually have.
 </p>
<p>
  When they don’t have enough hunters to maintain them, and mana creatures begin to leave the Hunter’s Spot due to overpopulation. Thereby causing problems with the world itself due to them ruining the ecosystem.
 </p>
<p>
  But my actions here have kind of destroyed that problem. With this Hunter’s Spot, at least.
 </p>
<p>
  Also destroying the Hunter’s Spot itself.
 </p>
<p>
  Until it slowly recovers itself from my explosives.
 </p>
<p>
  Everyone knows that explosives are the best way to deal with problems though.
 </p>
<p>
  I yawn before glancing at the number of beings granted death, which is rapidly shooting up every second by the hundreds. Then I lie back and stare up at the ceiling of the cavern from the small little terrace that I’m in high up at the top of the frozen chamber. Just dropping my book on my chest as I do so.
 </p>
<p>
  Come to think of it, when was the last time I left this glacier? It can’t have been more than a year, right?
 </p>
<p>
  Not sure.
 </p>
<p>
  Makes me wonder what Leone is doing outside…
 </p>
<p>
  I think back to the last thing I saw her doing. Which was picking a fight with all of the royal knights of this kingdom, seemingly having a lot of fun while doing it.
 </p>
<p>
  Something about her needing training against a lot of different enemies.
 </p>
<p>
  Will the… kingdom be okay by the time I get out of here?
 </p>
<p>
  Maybe I should stop by to check on it…
 </p>
<p>
  I think that while still lying down and staring up at the ceiling, unmoving.
 </p>
<p>
  Several seconds pass.
 </p>
<p>
  Meh. Not my problem.
 </p>
<p>
  Something I’m looking forward to is the other benefit I’ll get from reaching level one hundred. Something Famine also told me just recently.
 </p>
<p>
  Although I kind of wish he would stop sending me messages so frequently. It’s annoying.
 </p>
<p>
  Even if it’s simply because the guy only recognizes other Horsemen as people and is friendly to all of us because of that.
 </p>
<p>
  Anyways, Horsemen get two things when they reach level one hundred.
 </p>
<p>
  Their horse, and their magic.
 </p>
<p>
  I smile at the thought of actually becoming a mage.
 </p>
<p>
  With death magic I’ll finally be able to cast spells of my own. Actual spells like a mage instead of just the skills I’ve gotten from the System.
 </p>
<p>
  Other than that, I should be able to sense mana as well. Something I can’t do right now.
 </p>
<p>
  Even if I won’t have mana of my own. Just my natural death energy.
 </p>
<p>
  And judging by how terrified all of the necromancers I’ve seen get just from the sight of me, I probably have a lot of death energy. Not to mention how I’m a literal beacon when I go to Rex Dynasty worlds.
 </p>
<p>
  Something I didn’t learn about for a little while. Which was awkward when I heard about the reason for those ‘terrorist attacks’ before.
 </p>
<p>
  I purse my lips at that thought.
 </p>
<p>
  Probably best not to go to Rex Dynasty worlds that aren’t their capital.
 </p>
<p>
  I yawn before slowly closing my eyes, only to hear the dragon roaring and marching straight into the cavern.
 </p>
<p>
  Damnit.
 </p>
<p>
  This dragon is getting annoying.
 </p>
<p>
  I stand up again with a scowl on my face as I begin to search through my storage ring for items that I could use against the pest. But I don’t find any items strong enough to kill the Tier 10 mana creature.
 </p>
<p>
  So I do the next best thing.
 </p>
<p>
  The dragon seems to like following my trail and trying and failing to destroy my Death Spirits, so why don’t I lead it somewhere?
 </p>
<p>
  With that thought in mind, I jump down from the cavern terrace before landing on the ground completely within sight of the dragon. Enraging it in the process. Then I proceed to charge straight through the cavern to a tunnel, letting the massive creature chase after me.
 </p>
<p>
  A chase that ends up taking a while, with me actually getting into my hover car and driving through the Endless Glaciers to stay ahead of it.
 </p>
<p>
  All the way till I reach the Tier 10 parts of the Endless Glacier. At which point I lead the dragon straight into the territory of another dragon, making the dragon cover the other dragon’s territory with its scent as it passes by to chase me.
 </p>
<p>
  Then I keep going to another dragon’s territory.
 </p>
<p>
  And another.
 </p>
<p>
  And another.
 </p>
<p>
  All while feeling happy that I have no scent personally. Probably because I’m Death.
 </p>
<p>
  After half a dozen dragon’s territories, I finally make it to the center of the Endless Glacier. With the dragon charging in behind me.
 </p>
<p>
  Before the thing halts in terror when it sees the Grand Frost Dragon ruling over this entire Endless Glacier slowly getting up with anger in its gaze directed at the smaller dragon. The thing completely ignoring a ‘small-fry’ like myself when the larger dragon is right there behind me making a fuss.
 </p>
<p>
  I make a U-turn to go back around the currently terrified dragon and flee.
 </p>
<p>
  Only briefly giving the thing a salute of goodbye and farewell as I do so.
 </p>
<p>
  Yeah, I probably should’ve done that sooner instead of letting it rampage for years, but whatever.
 </p>
<p>
  That dragon is now bigger dragon chow.
 </p>
<p>
  In a sense, considering that these frost dragons are blocks of ice that don’t eat. But the point is made.
 </p>
<p>
  Anyways, time to go back to Tier 5 again to take that overdue nap.
 </p>
