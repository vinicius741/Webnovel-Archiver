   he artificial evening cast long shadows across Ndovu Zenith's towers. Through the transparent walkway connecting the districts, Earth hung in perfect half-phase - its southern hemisphere ablaze with reflected sunlight. Africa's familiar bulk and South America's distinctive shape flanked the Atlantic, while the northern half remained in shadow, faintly visible in the glow of city lights.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari's boots clicked against the tower's entrance platform. The artificial atmosphere carried hints of recycled air and hydroponic gardens from the nearby agricultural dome. His palms were slick despite the climate control maintaining a perfect twenty-two degrees.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He was in his dress uniform from dinner - the emerald green jacket with its gold piping and distinctive angular cut that marked all Kimaris Warband officers.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You look like someone marching to their own execution, mate."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Wilhelm van der Merwe lounged on a carved bench near the entrance, a glass of orange wine catching the earthlight. Even here, before one of Ndovu's most sacred buildings, he managed to look like he owned the place. Wearing a uniform similar to Jabari's, the Valoran man' Plasma Carbine rested within arm's reach - Kimaris Warband habits died hard.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Well, that's about how it feels." Jabari stopped, wiping his hands on his uniform. "Sex with Fuuka to unlock…what? Powers I might not even have?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Powers you definitely have, or the Sand Lotus wouldn't waste their time." Wilhelm swirled his wine, the orange liquid almost glowing. "Speaking of which—" He gestured to a floating service tray nearby. "Pour yourself a glass. You're vibrating like a tuning fork."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I don't drink on missions." Jabari replied almost too quick.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "By the Thousand Gods, Jabari, this isn't a mission. Yet." Wilhelm's tone carried unusual seriousness. "Tomorrow, when we meet the Imperium forces, you handling that Moondust shard? That's the mission. Tonight's just…preparation."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari hesitated, then poured himself a glass. The wine smelled of citrus and something earthier - South African terroir surviving even in lunar vineyards.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I keep thinking about Seydou," Jabari said, sitting heavily on the bench. "We had that first shard. Then we gave it to Skarn so Ume can live. And here I am, about to—"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "About to gain the power to set things right?" Wilhelm finished. "Seems fitting to me."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I don't know." The wine was tart on his tongue, warming as it went down. "My grandmother always said the body was a temple."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "And temples need priests, don't they?" Wilhelm took another sip. "Of course, temples can't give consent. You, however…"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Above them, Earth maintained its perfect half-phase - the southern hemisphere brilliant with sunlight, Africa and South America standing vigil over the Atlantic's blue expanse. The northern half lurked in shadow, cities glittering like captured stars.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Ume wasn't happy about this," Jabari said quietly. "When she found out about the ritual. She got all robot-like. Started quoting statistics about arousal, Aether flow...all the sciency things."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That her way of saying she's jealous?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I don't know. Maybe?" Jabari took another drink, the wine loosening something in his chest. "She said Fuuka was beautiful. Something like ninety-something percentile facial symmetry."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Wilhelm snorted as he looked up from his glass. "What a proper android to quantify attraction like that. Though she's not wrong - Fuuka's gorgeous."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "My first time." Jabari's laugh came out strained. "Ekwensu, I can't believe I'm twenty-four and—"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "And?" Wilhelm raised his glass.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Which god should I pray to? Anansi? Shango? Pachamama?" Jabari inquired, the names of various Earthern deities in the Directorate's Thousand-Gods religion across continents flashing in his mind.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I don't feel focused. The gods must have some wisdom to shine on…whatever I'm about to do."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What? Training instead of shagging your way through?" Wilhelm's perpetual smirk softened. "There's no divine intervention for these things, mate."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The wine was working - Jabari felt his shoulders unclenching, his breathing steadying. "What if I can't... perform? What if I finish in thirty seconds? What if—"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What if you stop thinking and start feeling?" Wilhelm interrupted. "My first time without paying someone - this woman from Io, before I joined up. Suyay Mamani. Most unforgettable soul in the system. When she kissed me, I forgot my own bloody name."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Me. Made an absolute arse of myself, trying to quote poetry I'd memorized." He chuckled. "She laughed. Not cruelly. Told me to stop performing and start being present."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The tower chimed softly. Through the transparent doors, warm light beckoned.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I declined drinking with you before," Jabari said suddenly. "At HQ. After the plaza attack."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You did. Like a dutiful, proper lieutenant on his first day."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I was scared. Of relaxing. Of not being ready for whatever the next crisis is." He finished his wine. "Ume ran diagnostics over and over on the Gyata tonight. Is that her version of being scared?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "And is this yours? Sitting here with me instead of running to that tower?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Maybe." Jabari set down his glass, surprised to find his hands steady. "Or maybe I needed this. The wine. The talk. Someone to tell me it's okay."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Tomorrow, we will meet the Imperium in gory combat, Tomorrow, the Alliance will still be the pain in the arse they've been. All that bloody shite. " Wilhelm stood, retrieving his carbine. "But tonight?" He clapped Jabari's shoulder. "No mission parameters. Just a few people connecting and learning something."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari stood, legs steadier than expected. The wine had done its work - he felt not drunk, just present. "Any other advice?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Stop thinking about Ume. Stop thinking about Seydou. Stop thinking about the mission." Wilhelm's grip tightened briefly. "For once in your life, just let things happen."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The doors opened at Jabari's approach. Inside, a spiral staircase wound upward, lit by bioluminescent panels that mimicked earthlight. Each step would carry him higher, closer to transformation.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   abari paused at the threshold. "Thanks, Wilhelm."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Whatever for? We just happened to be here at the same time. Pure coincidence, of course. Nothing planned or discussed." The major blinked one eye.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari chuckled. "Right."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Wilhelm's grin was warm, his blonde hair and sun-tanned countenance brimming with vigor. "Go on. Twenty-second hour waits for no one."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari entered the tower, the doors sealing behind him with a soft hiss. Through the transparent walls, he looked out as Earth kept its eternal watch - the southern hemisphere ablaze with light. Africa and South America bore witness to their children.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Behind him, Wilhelm drained his orange wine and headed back toward the barracks below, whistling an old Afrikaner tune.
  </span>

 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Room 108, Level 42, Eastern Tower, Sankofa District, Ndovu Zenith, Mare Nubium, Near Side, Osram, Emerald Directorate territory
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The spiral staircase ended at a simple wooden door, its surface carved with intricate patterns - lotus flowers intertwining with geometric shapes that seemed to shift in the bioluminescent light. Jabari's hand hesitated at the handle. His grandmother's voice echoed in memory: The body is a temple, boy. Guard it well.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   But Wilhelm's words rang louder: Just let things happen.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He knocked twice, the sound hollow in the narrow hallway.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Enter," came Fuuka's voice, melodic and calm.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He pressed a button on the wall, and the door hissed open.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The chamber beyond wasn't what he'd expected. A comfortable room with round floor cushions — prayer mats — arranged around a low table. The air carried subtle incense, not overwhelming but present - something floral he couldn't name.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   An unlit seven-wicked candle stood at the far end of the room.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Fuuka knelt beside the table, pouring what looked like tea into two cups. She still wore the flowing robe of cream silk, adorned with delicate chrysanthemum patterns in gold and rust. Her black hair fell in its signature bob cut, the precise edges framing her face, bangs just brushing above dark eyes that held unexpected vulnerability.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Jabari." She looked up, her professional mask intact as she gestured to the cushion across from her. "Please, sit."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Okay." Jabari removed his boots at the entrance and crossed to the cushions. The floor was warm beneath his socks, heated from below. As he lowered himself across from her, their knees almost touched.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The high collar of his uniform pressed against his throat, the fabric crisp and formal despite the long day. His rank insignia caught the soft light as he shifted, a reminder of duty even in this most personal moment. Beneath the jacket, his fitted undershirt clung to his muscular frame.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You've had dinner?" Fuuka inquired softly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Uh... what?" He raised an eyebrow.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It's customary to ensure we're both properly nourished before the Ritual." She paused, her pearl-like eyes searching his. "It will be...intense."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Right!" He rested one hand on the prayer mat, finding solace in its texture. "Yeah, I've had dinner. Starches and chicken, jollof rice, all that."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Beverage first," she said, offering him a cup. Her movements were graceful, practiced, but her fingers trembled slightly against the ceramic. "It helps with preparation."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Only then did Jabari realize this was no tea.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The liquid was sapphire blue, odd on his tongue but soothing as it went down, like cooked fruit. His hands wrapped around the cup.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You're nervous," Fuuka observed. Not mockingly, just stating fact.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I-I am." He managed a shaky reply. "This isn't tea."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Over-extracted Indra-Sprite." Fuuka nodded, gesturing to a phial on the table. The phial held more of the blue liquid, shimmering invitingly. "I heated it before you came to make it easier to digest."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "An Aether potion? How does it..." Jabari caught himself. As the warm liquid settled in his stomach, he found himself becoming acutely aware of Fuuka's presence. His heart beat faster, his body warmed, and instead of simply looking at her, he found himself entranced by the apple red of her lips, the smooth curve of her neck, the contours of her body beneath the robe.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Aphrodisiac?" He asked, though the answer was already evident. He set the empty cup on the table.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Of a sort." She nodded, rising to approach the seven-wicked candle. Pointing at it, she whispered a spell: "
   <em>
    Sólbrenna Eldr
   </em>
   ."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A wisp of golden energy shot from her fingertips. The candle ignited, its sandalwood-scented flame casting warm shadows throughout the room.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   From a carved alcove beside the candle, she retrieved an ornate lantern - amber glass held within intricate metalwork, its woven handle dark with age. The device pulsed gently as she lifted it, responding to her touch.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "This is a Spirit Lantern. It won't be yours tonight," she said quietly, setting it on the low table between them. "But it will help guide the ritual. The lantern connects to Aether flows - it will show us when your awakening begins."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Sounds useful." Jabari said. The amber glow intensified slightly, casting honeyed light across his features.
  </span>
 </p>
 <span>
  <br/>
  The tale has been stolen; if detected on Amazon, report the violation.
  <br/>
 </span>
 <p>
  <span>
   But Fuuka's tone turned clinical as she faced away from him. "Undress yourself. Place your clothes wherever you wish."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Oh." Taken aback, he asked, noting the stark difference of this sitaution from the holo-vids often shared between depot mates back in reserve officer school. "So, we're not going to...?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Undressing each other is not what the Ritual requires." Her voice remained businesslike.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   It dawned on him then. She'd made it clear - this was business, necessity, not intimate lovemaking between soulmates or lovers.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Right." As if conducting an equipment check before a high-priority mission, Jabari moved efficiently to remove his uniform: jacket, undershirt, belt, military pants, socks — they fell to the floor one by one, until only his white underwear remained.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   But there he hesitated. He'd never removed his underwear in front of anyone. He stood frozen, uncertain.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Well? Are you done?" Fuuka still didn't look at him.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I... think so." His voice came out dry.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She turned and walked toward him, her delicate hands moving to untie the sash holding her robe, not a hint of hesitation in her fluid movements.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari could barely breathe as her robe fell away, revealing the white porcelain canvas of her body. The gentle slope of her small breasts, the areola there, her slender waist, the lush grove of her pubes — everything about her seemed lifted from the Imperium legends he'd read on the Extranet, visualizations of fae and celestials made flesh.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Shyly, he looked away. He'd never seen any real woman naked, let alone someone he felt attracted to.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Then she stood before him. The touch of her hand sent warmth racing up his arm. Jabari became acutely aware of how close they were, but he averted his gaze — up, to the left, out the window where Earth hung suspended in the lunar sky. It felt as if the entire planet was witnessing this moment.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Fuuka's voice came. "Try to relax. Lie down on your back."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Okay." He said, already moving.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Rest your head on the prayer mat." She continued, patting the cushion beneath him encouragingly, tone neutral but not unkind.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari complied, lowering himself down, using the prayer mat as a pillow. He felt the soft, blanketed floor against his broad back and shoulders. Fuuka knelt beside him, her nude form close enough for him to feel the warmth radiating from her skin.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "We can't do it with this on," she said, motioning to Jabari's underwear and the telltale bulge beneath.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Alright." He mumbled, unsure. "I can—"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I'll handle it," she assured him, her tone steady. With quick, confident movements, she removed his underwear as he nervously lifted his legs. Tossing the garment aside, she placed her hand on his arousal. Jabari felt wonderful and tongue-tied, the sensation of someone else's fingers and nails on his skin was electric.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   With a delicate touch, she began to caress his member, her fingers gliding up and down his length. The sensation caused Jabari to take a sharp breath; it was intense, but he didn't know what to do with himself, unsure if he should simply lie there and receive her ministrations. Concern fluttered across his face.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Don't think." Fuuka whispered. "Just feel."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Before he could say anything, his body reacted on its own. He felt his arousal growing in her hand, filling with blood until it stood fully erect. Her fingers continued, exploring his hardness, running over the tip, making him want to buck his hips and moan in appreciation.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Before he knew it, his strong hands were on her delicate shoulders, boldly pulling her towards him. Fuuka's subtle smile was assent enough.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She straddled him, her legs on either side of his body. Her hand, now sticky with sliver of his fluid, guided his length into her warm, wet depths.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He groaned as he entered her, feeling the walls of her womanhood tighten around him. But as he began to rock his hips, something was wrong. She released a slight moan, not the appreciative kind he was expecting.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Fuuka?" he asked breathlessly. "What's wrong?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He felt her vagina tightening further, then spasming slightly, and she hissed. "It's too big," she managed, and began to lift herself off of him.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Too…?" He felt a mixture of pain and surprise that had nothing to do with his arousal. "I mean, is it uncomfortable?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She said nothing, but the tightness in her lower body did not relax, clenching rhythmically, uncomfortably.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I knew it was big," she remarked, "but I didn't expect —" she broke off with a moan, the muscles in her core working in opposition to her attempts to lift herself off.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Unsure what else to do, Jabari reached down to help her, but as he did, his body responded. The head of his penis was still embedded within her, throbbing and pulsing, ready to release.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "No!" She managed to wrench herself away, rolling off of him and onto the mat beside, breathing hard. "Hold it back…the Ritual hasn't even started..."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Her black hair was tangled, and her face flushed. Her chest heaved, and Jabari thought he saw a tear glistening in the corner of one eye. Ashamed, he turned his face away, crossing his arms over his sensitive body, part of him still erect and throbbing, the other part of him feeling incredibly small.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   But then Fuuka's calm voice resumed. "Good. You've held your Aether." she said, her tone softer now, hand moving towards his crotch. "The Ritual requires physical closeness, not the urge to copulate…though it's been known to help."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I'm sorry," Jabari managed, unsure what else to say. His body felt like it was on fire, wanting release, but he willed himself to wait, so the pathways to his psionic powers could open at the end of it. "For hurting you."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She waved a hand dismissively, though he caught the subtle wince as she moved, and the gleam of tears in her eyes.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It'll pass." She inhaled deeply, her delicate shoulders rising and falling. "Give me a moment to…center myself."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   With deft movements, she repositioned herself on top of him once more. Her body lowered once more, and he sucked in a breath as he felt the head of his penis at her entrance, then the slow give of her womanhood accepting him, inch by inch. Jabari fought for control, biting his lip to stop himself from thrusting or releasing, his hands fisting the mat beneath him.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Somewhere in the distance, a clock on the wall beeped, as if the universe marked this moment. He turned his head to see the current time clearly displayed: '
   <em>
    22:45, March 19, 2295
   </em>
   '.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Focus on the Ritual." Fuuka breathed as Jabari felt her delicate hand on his cheek, turning his face to her. "On me."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I've never done it with anyone before," he said, starting to form a fist before her fingers stopped him, tightened around his.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She smiled again. "I haven't done it this month, so it's warm-up for us both."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Right. Warm-up." He felt the tension drain slightly, replaced by anticipation. The nervousness was still there under his skin like an itch, but he had a feeling Fuuka wouldn't mock him for it.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   After a second's hesitation, he took her hand, interlocking their fingers. Their breathing synchronized - hers deep and slow, his gradually matching.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The silence that followed was heavy. Jabari focused on the pulse in her hand, tried not to think too hard. This was Fuuka. He was nervous, sure, but he was also achingly turned on. The Indra-Sprite helped, pushing those instincts to the surface.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "So…now?" He asked. His heart hammered wildly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Fuuka's full red lips curved into a smile. "We go slowly."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She adjusted her position, fluttering her eyes shut, riding him slowly. Jabari's stomach muscles tensed as he held himself back.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Deep breaths," she muttered. "Be calm as a lake. Rule your mind."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Still confused, he kept his eyes open to peak at Fuuka.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Her eyes were closed, her exquisite features wore an expression of pleasure and — detachment? Her dark hair framed her face, lips slightly parted, muscles taut as she lifted and lowered her body, taking him in, her breaths calm and steady as she grinded him.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari tried to breathe in sync with the Sand Lotus priestess, but his mind wandered. In the few pornography and sexual materials he'd consumed, women often made love in hyper-provocative ways, their moans and screeches loud, their motions wild and uncontrolled, seductive and enticing to the extreme.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   But here, Fuuka's slender form was a picture of serenity. She simply breathed in and out each time she moved her hips. No excessive display or stimulation.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Nonetheless, the way her tender flesh clenched his was such exquisite torture. He found himself nearing the edge of release again.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Suddenly, she paused, eyes still closed, one hand reaching up, resting on his chest, instructing gently. "Eyes closed. Rule your mind."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You…" Blushing, Jabari stammered, his release held back. "You know?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I've done this many times." Her smile was confident. "Your physical eyes must shut for your mind to open — the Awakening comes when you see the vision."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The vision, huh?" Jabari grinned despite himself. His eyes screwed shut in concentration as he felt Fuuka's fingers moving away from his chest to intertwine with his. They were now connected on three: both hands, plus their most intimate parts.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Breathing in, I calm body and mind. Breathing out, I smile." Fuuka said between grinds, tone impressively even in spite of the stimulating ordeal.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "A Sand Lotus quote?" Jabari managed. His own pleasure built, a wave gathering force.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That was by Master Thich Nhat Hanh, a peace activist back in the Digital Age. The Father of Mindfulness, they called him." She replied, like a teacher recalling her favorite part of a book. "We Sand Lotus like to think our understanding of the world align with great sages of eras past. Even if they were never one of us."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That sounds…profound." He wanted to thrust up, to meet her movements, to take what she offered and more, but he held back, willing the sensations to sharpen his latent psionic senses.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What about you? Have any Directorate wisdom to share?" Fuuka tilted her head, maintaining the grind but slowing it.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "My grandmother used to say..." Jabari's voice came out strained but thoughtful. "'The river that flows slowly reaches the sea.' She'd tell me that whenever I rushed through doing anything."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Maridian wisdom?" Fuuka's movements became even more deliberate, matching the proverb's meaning.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yeah. She had a saying for everything." His fingers tightened around hers as another wave of pleasure threatened to overwhelm him. "Also…'When spider webs unite, they can tie up a lion.'"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Mmm. Unity through connection." Her breath hitched slightly - the first crack in her serene facade. "How fitting for what we're doing."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Is it working?" Jabari asked, eyes still closed. "The Awakening?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Patience." Her voice carried a smile. "The river hasn't reached the sea yet —"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The world shifted.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   One moment Jabari felt Fuuka's warmth above him, the next he stood in a twilight forest. Cherry blossoms drifted like snow, their petals glowing faintly in colors that shouldn't exist - gold bleeding into violet, silver melting into jade. The air tasted of honey and iron.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Fuuka stood beside him, clothed now in flowing white robes, her Spirit Lantern casting dancing shadows. Her hand remained clasped in his - the only constant between worlds.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Where..." Jabari looked down. He wore simple linen pants, his chest bare but marked with glowing patterns he'd never seen before - geometric shapes that pulsed with his heartbeat.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The threshold," Fuuka said softly. "Where your mind meets mine, where Aether becomes form."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   They walked deeper into the grove, petals crunching beneath bare feet. The trees grew denser, their branches forming a canopy that blocked out whatever sky existed in this place.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Then the trees began to move.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Not trees - legs. Eight massive legs, each thick as ancient baobabs, descended from the canopy. The spider that lowered itself defied comprehension - its body vast as a starship, covered in patterns that shifted between Adinkra symbols and constellations. Eight eyes regarded them, each containing a different phase of the moon.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "FUUKA NATSUKAWA." The voice came from everywhere and nowhere. "WHY DO YOU BRING THIS MAN INTO YOUR GROVE?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari's knees wanted to buckle, but Fuuka's grip kept him standing.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Great Anansi," she bowed her head respectfully. "This is my forest. I bring whom I choose."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "YOU KNOW ME, LOTUS DAUGHTER?" The spider's tone carried surprise.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Sand Lotus studies all paths to enlightenment," Fuuka replied. "Wisdom wears many masks - Buddha the Enlightened One, Anansi the Wise, Pachamama the Earth Mother. All are threads in the greater web."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "A SAND LOTUS PRIESTESS STUDIES MARIDIAN LORE?" The Spider God's mandibles clicked in what might have been amusement. "AND BRINGS A SON OF MY PEOPLE TO FOREIGN SOIL?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I guide him to awakening, nothing more." Fuuka's voice stayed steady. "When enlightenment comes, he will leave."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "WILL HE?" Anansi descended further, until one massive eye filled Jabari's vision. In its depths, he saw himself - not as he was, but as he could be. Wreathed in golden flame, commanding powers that bent reality. "YOUNG ONE. DO YOU KNOW WHY THE SPIDER WEAVES?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "To...to catch prey?" Jabari managed.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "FOOLISH." The eye narrowed. "YOU THINK LIKE A BRUTE. HUNTER, NOT CREATOR."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Then to build," Jabari corrected himself, finding strength in defiance. "To make something from nothing."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "BETTER. BUT SHALLOW." Anansi's legs shifted, the forest trembling. "YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S GRANDMOTHER KNEW! THE SPIDER WEAVES BECAUSE THE WEB ALREADY EXISTS. WE MERELY MAKE IT VISIBLE."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The forest began to shift. Cherry blossoms became stars, the ground beneath them transformed into a vast web spanning galaxies. Jabari felt his consciousness expanding.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The web you're talking about." he gasped before continuing. "It's all connected? Everything? All psionic force in the cosmos are connected!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "PRETTY WORDS." Anansi's voice turned sharp. "BUT YOU GAVE AWAY YOUR FIRST SHARD OF MOONDUST CRYSTAL. LET IT SLIP THROUGH YOUR FINGERS LIKE WATER. WHAT MAKES YOU WORTHY OF POWER NOW?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Wait. You know about the Crystal? How?" Jabari replied, taken aback.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "ANSWER MY QUESTION FIRST." The Spider God demanded.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I saved Ume," Jabari's jaw clenched. "I'd do it again."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "SENTIMENT. WEAKNESS." The magnificent spider circled them, each footfall shaking reality. "YOU CHOOSE ONE LIFE OVER THOUSANDS. VERY HUMAN. VERY FOOLISH."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Then I'm foolish." Jabari stepped forward, keeping one hand in Fuuka's grip, raising another to make a determined fist gesture. "But I won't apologize for choosing friends over assets. That's makes us different from machines. From monsters."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "MONSTERS." Anansi laughed, a sound like thunder. "YOUNG ONE, I ATE GODS BEFORE YOUR ANCESTORS DREAMED OF FIRE. WHAT ARE YOU BUT ANOTHER MORSEL?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I'm the one standing here," Jabari shot back. "In this grove, at this moment. Either I'm worthy or I'm not. But I won't beg."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "EAGER." The Spider God boomed, bobbing his magnificent head slowly. "STATE YOUR INTENT."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Awaken the psionic power within me." Jabari stood straight, earning an approving look from Fuuka. "Fuuka has led me here, and I will carry the power."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Silence stretched between them. Then, slowly, Anansi's mandibles spread in what might have been approval.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "NOW YOU BEGIN TO SEE." The spider's form started to shimmer. "PRIDE AND HUMILITY. STRENGTH AND COMPASSION. THE WEB REQUIRES BOTH. WHAT WILL YOU WEAVE WITH THIS POWER, JABARI ADOMAKO?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Power rushed through him - not from Fuuka, not from the ritual, but from something deeper. The golden patterns on his chest blazed brighter, spreading across his skin like living tattoos. He felt the Aether responding, bending to his will.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I'll weave..." He looked at Fuuka, her face illuminated by both her Spirit Lantern and his newfound light. "I'll weave a path between my people and the Moondust Crystal. Even if it costs me everything."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "EVERYTHING?" Anansi's eight eyes gleamed. "WE SHALL SEE, LITTLE WEAVER. WE SHALL SEE."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The vision shattered as Jabari opened his eyes.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   They were back in the chamber, both gasping.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That was..." Jabari commented, feeling her tender flesh still clenched around his schlong. The sensation was becoming impossible to ignore. "…wow."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Your vision is complete. Now…" Fuuka's voice became husky as she resumed the grinding, her movements quickened, her rhythmic rise and fall stoking the fire in his veins. She too had her eyes open, fixing him with a searing look, an encouraging whisper parting from her red lips: "
   <em>
    Sāmarasya
   </em>
   ."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   All at once, his senses exploded. He felt Fuuka's pleasure as his own, the wet heat of her canal, the moans torn from her throat, and beneath it all, a rush of connection as he pulled her down to meet his rapid upward thrusts, his body locking with hers, hips rising, spine arching. She cried out, her body spasming, tightening further around him.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   With a groan, Jabari moved his hands to her waist, fingers digging into her smooth skin as he thrust up to meet her, his back arching. And somewhere in that moment, something within him cracked open.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He released, flooding her depths with hot jets of his juice.
  </span>
