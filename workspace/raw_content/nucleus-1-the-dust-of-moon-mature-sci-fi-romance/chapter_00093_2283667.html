<p class="cnM4NTQyNThkOTRhZjQ2ZDRhMWE3ZGQwOGU5ZDc0ZGNm"><strong><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">09:30, March 10, 2295</span></strong></p>
<p class="cnMxZmRkZWVmZGU3MzQzNjVhNTI4Y2ViYzdmNGZiNTNh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Quincy-Parker Conference Room, Floor 92, Triumph Tower, 401 N Wabash Ave, Chicago, IL 60611, Terra Alliance territory</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYzhlZjc0NGNlNDQ2MTA4MDJkZWYyNGQ0MmE2ZGFi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><span style="font-size: 1.5em"><strong>A</strong></span>rtak Otis stood before the mirrored panel in the Triumph Tower's executive washroom, adjusting the collar of his pristine white coat with practiced precision. The face that stared back at him was weathered yet dignified—a visage that had witnessed decades of humanity's struggle against forces both terrestrial and cosmic.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDdhMTFhZjNhYTQzY2I4MjQ0NDdmZWZjODk4YjMw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The shard is ready," Thomas Mendoza's voice came from behind him, low and cautious. The marine's reflection appeared in the mirror, his massive frame filling the doorway, the silver of his bionic arms catching the light. "Are you certain about this, Director?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YjZmOGNjMDkwZjRiMGRhYzg3MWZkZmY2YzQ5NDQ0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Artak met Thomas's concerned gaze in the mirror. "The Corporate Chamber has already made up their minds, Thomas. This merely... ensures the outcome aligns with humanity's interests."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZTEzMjdmMDU5ODQ2OTY4MjQ5OTM5ZjA0YTI4Y2Jk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Thomas approached, his footsteps unnaturally quiet for a man of his size. In his outstretched palm lay a small velvet pouch, its contents emitting a subtle blue glow that seeped through the fabric.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNmVhYjlhOGQ0NjQ4ZjJhYTcwNDRkZmFiMmIxMTFl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Moondust Crystal's shard, acquired by Lorna, Xin and Emmanuel on the distant moon Shashan.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2N2FiZmYwYzNkNjQ3N2NhMmVlMWVkZWJlNzE2MTNj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Dr. Nikki says extended exposure could have side effects. Headaches. Auditory hallucinations. Possibly worse."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MTQ2MjYxN2QwMTQxMGE5MTIxNDNiYTNjNTRhYmYx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Artak turned, taking the pouch with a steady hand. "I appreciate her concern. And yours." He slipped the pouch into an inner pocket of his coat, where the glow became imperceptible. "But we stand at a crossroads. The Imperium has the main Crystal. The Directorate possibly possesses a shard of their own. The scales have tipped, and we must restore balance."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMjk0NTVjMGY5MTQwMjliMGY3MzVmNTQ2NzQyZGZh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"There are other ways—"</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZjAwOGIxMTMwYTQzYjI4YjU4MDMzMzNhZjEzZDQ1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Are there?" Artak's voice remained gentle, but his eyes hardened. "Last month, Delegate Pompeo nearly succeeded in dismantling SIMU entirely. The Chamber views us as an unnecessary expense while threats multiply across the Five Realms." He placed a hand on Thomas's shoulder. "Sometimes, Thomas, protecting humanity requires difficult choices."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYWNlNzRkOTIwNDQ4MTRiMTkxMzRkMDIyMTRhNDQ5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Thomas handed over the pouch with evident reluctance. As Artak reached for it, Dr. Nikki Chakraborty stepped into the washroom, her expression grave.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZDVhMWJiMTMzMDQwMGJhNWQwN2JkZWRlZjI2NzVm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Director, a moment before you proceed." Her voice was low but firm. "There are precautions you need to understand."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMTMzYWRhOTM3ZjQxZTdhNTdjOTQxNzlkYjMzOWZi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Artak nodded, respecting the doctor's expertise. "Of course."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNGFmOWY0YmNlOTQ4NGVhYjIxMWMxZmEwMTg0MzYy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Nikki glanced at the door to ensure they remained private. "The shard responds to the Moondust Chant, but different sections trigger different effects." She withdrew a small tablet, displaying a document with Sanskrit text and translations. "I researched the data with Xin. Not sure where he learned Devavāṇī, but we've identified three distinct components."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OTMwZjM5OWYxYTQxMjZiZWZkMzhlYTM3ZDQ0MjZj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She pointed to the first section. "The 'Thread of Connection' portion is what you should use today. It creates subtle receptivity—a gentle nudge rather than outright control. The subjects maintain autonomy while becoming more... amenable to suggestion."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NGZhZDUxMWUwYjRhNmU4Njc3M2ZjY2ViMzJlMzE2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"And the other sections?" Artak asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMjA3MTkyOTVkZDQ1ODdhMGU4NzAxNDYwMjA1NGE2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The middle portion—'Unbroken Consciousness'—is what we'd use against the Radi-Mons. It disrupts existing mental connections, potentially useful against hiveminds but dangerous for humans." Her finger moved to the final section. "Under no circumstances should you attempt the Final Activation."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMTg3YWYxZWQ0ZDQ1ODBiYTZlODYxMTFiZTM0MzBj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"'The Dust of Moon, the Ocean of Minds,'" Artak read aloud.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YjIwMmQ0YWE1MTRiMzA4YjljYTEyMDg4OWVjNzJm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Nikki's expression darkened. "Yes. According to our research, it's designed to amplify the Crystal's power exponentially. In the wrong context..." She hesitated. "The shard could attempt to establish a connection with the main Crystal body, regardless of distance. The neural feedback alone..."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYTM1YWM5YTdiMjQ4NjA5NjdlNmMwOTlmN2IxNzcw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Just say it could kill me." Artak quipped calmly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNTI4Zjk2MThkNDRkMGY4NGU4MjZjY2JmZjBhMzdj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Or worse, sir." Nikki's eyes met his, evidently in no mood to joke. "We still don't fully understand the Crystal's capabilities. Just stick to the 'Thread of Connection' portion, and limit your exposure time."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNWU2ODQ1ZWRhMDRhMzVhNTAwNjY3N2RhZThiY2Nj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Thomas shifted uncomfortably. "Maybe we should reconsider this like, entirely?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYWJhMTQ4YzI0MjRjYzRhZWRlZWU3ODVjNjk3OWRl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Too late for that," Artak replied with a sly smile, slipping the pouch into his inner pocket. "The SIMU needs this funding. I'll be careful and only use the recommended section."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZmMxYWI1NmJlZjQ4NGE5ZmY0ZGRlYjQ2MTFlNDY0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Nikki nodded reluctantly before turning and pacing back to the hall outside. "I've prepared medications for the aftermath. The headaches will be... significant."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOGJkNjc4NzI3NjQwNmI4MzRmMmU3ZWI2MTNhNzkz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"A small price," Artak said, moving toward the door. "For our future."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiM2YwMjdlMjZhNzQxZTJhNDgzZDZhZmEyYTc3NWJm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Thomas's expression remained troubled, but he nodded once, his loyalty to the Director evident despite his reservations.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZWNhMjk2NmYzMDQzMTA4NTJhNzFmMzY2OTJlYzRi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The session begins in ten minutes," Artak said, moving past Thomas toward the door. "Ensure Diego has the presentation materials ready."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYzY1YzNiYzEzMTQ0Nzg5MmViODA4M2I0ZjFiNWQz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yes, sir." Thomas hesitated. "And if President Harrison realizes what's happening?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOWZlYzM2MTQyNjQyYzA5NWFkY2RhNzMwNzJhODMw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Artak paused, his hand on the door. "Harry is a politician. He'll recognize necessity when he sees it." A thin smile crossed his face. "Besides, plausible deniability has always been the cornerstone of leadership."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NmYyMGRjZGIxZTQ2ZTVhODkzNDc2MWQ2YWViMWM3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">With that, he stepped into the corridor, leaving Thomas alone.</span></p>
<hr/>
<p class="cnNjYjQ0OTk0MWRiOTQ1NGRhODZlZDk5YjdhYmNlOTYx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The conference room gleamed with polished marble and cutting-edge technology—a fitting backdrop for the most powerful decision-makers in the Terra Alliance. The massive oval table at its center could accommodate twenty delegates, though today only twelve seats were filled: the eight voting members of the Corporate Chamber, President Harrison, Diego Rodriguez, Dr. Nikki Chakraborty, and the empty chair awaiting Director Otis.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MjQxYWMzYzliMjQwMWRhMjE3YWI0ODg3Yzg2YmVk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dante Pompeo IV dominated his section of the table through sheer physical presence, his massive frame barely contained by his chair. The inevitable cigar was already between his fingers, though not yet lit in deference to indoor regulations. His pale blue suit—the same shade he'd worn at their previous meeting—stretched across his bulk like sails in a storm.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNDI5OTg5MjIyMjRhYTdiZTRjNjA4MTA0ZjZlZjEw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Another emergency session," he grumbled to Viktor Petrov seated beside him. "As if the Alliance didn't hemorrhage enough money during the last one."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMGYzY2UzY2IwMzQ4YTBiYWU5ZGY2YWQ1OWM2YTE4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">President Harrison, positioned at the head of the table, maintained a neutral expression despite the comment clearly intended to reach his ears. His tailored suit shifted subtly between shades of gray as he moved, a testament to the material's advanced fabrication.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTM3MDQwMDVjNTQ0YzViNTI5ZWZlMzliOGZlOTU4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The session will be called to order once Director Otis arrives," Harrison announced, his Alabama drawl giving a warmth to the formal declaration. "Given the sensitive nature of recent developments, all quantum recordings are suspended for this meeting."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZDRiMWYzZTkyMzQwZTZhYjE1OTBlZGQzZWVlZWE0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Murmurs circulated around the table. Suspending recordings was unusual, even for classified discussions. Lawrence Campbell of NexLink raised an eyebrow but said nothing, his fingers tapping a rhythm on the tabletop.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMDY5MmQzYjYzMjQxNjRhZmRjYzE1ZmQ5MGY1OGE4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The doors slid open with a pneumatic hiss, and Artak Otis entered with measured steps. Diego Rodriguez rose to greet him, their exchange of whispers barely audible to the others as Artak took his place at the table.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNzQ5MWYxMGZhNTRjNjJiNTg5MTZkZjhlMjA1MTM5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Ladies and gentlemen of the Chamber," Artak began without preamble, his Armenian accent giving his words a scholarly cadence. "Mr. President. Thank you for convening on such short notice."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MzZiYmY0ZmMyZjQ5Y2RhNDM4OTg1OWI5NTBkMTA5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Cut to the chase, Otis," Dante interrupted, leaning forward. "Your 'urgent communiqué' dragged us away from actual responsibilities. What catastrophe are you peddling this time?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMTUwMTJlZWJiMjRkYmJhNzAyNTQ2ZGMxMDVlZGZh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Artak's expression remained unruffled. "Not a catastrophe, Delegate Pompeo. An opportunity." He gestured to Diego, who activated the holographic display above the table.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NDIwYjE0YzE3ODQ3MTNhZWRmYjNmZTc1NmI4Zjc0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A three-dimensional rendering of the Moondust Crystal materialized, its facets capturing and refracting the light just as it had during their previous meeting. But this time, something was different—the model seemed more defined, more precise in its geometries.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzZhYjI5YmY3MjQyNWU4MjM1NDg1MjdkYzc0NDM2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Three weeks ago, this body rejected SIMU's request for increased funding to pursue the Moondust Crystal," Artak continued. "Since then, circumstances have evolved rapidly."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OTJjOTIyOTVkMTQ0NzdiN2M0ODU2NTg0ZTlhOWE2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The hologram first displayed Imperial troops exchanging fire Alliance soldiers. Through it, figures like Lorna, Thomas, Emmanuel and Xin were visible, while Diego's StarWhale shuttle hovered somewhere above, safe from the bloodshed below.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YzBjZGYyNzY5MDRkYjY4Y2M3Y2JhNDU3MTUyOGM2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The hologram shifted, showing a space-based conflict near Zeeman Crater on Osram's Far Side. A Directorate ship, departing from what appeared to be a besieged lunar outpost falling to the Fenris Radi-Mons swarming it.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZDNlOTcxY2YyZjQ5OGY5NjRmZmY4YzUxYTM0ZTAw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"What's the meaning of this?" Dante challenged, raising a large hand at the image.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYzgyOTQ4ZDRhYTQzZDRhZTMyNzIwYzYyMGI2Yjlk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Both the Imperium of Dragons and the Emerald Directorate have deployed significant resources to Osram. Our intelligence confirms both factions have secured parts of the Crystal." Artak's voice remained measured, but there was an underlying urgency to his words. "The main Crystal body remains in play, but our window of opportunity is closing."</span></p><span class="cjU0MTBiZmUzNjQxYzQ0YTdiMzQxMWYyMjNjOWM0YzRj"><br/>This narrative has been purloined without the author's approval. Report any appearances on Amazon.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM5ZTJjMjIyZDk4NTQ5YTJhMzkxMzkxMmFhNThiYzA4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"And you expect us to throw good money after bad?" Dante scoffed. "Your theories were unconvincing last month. They remain so today."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YmFkNzFkZTY2ODQwMzU5ZmFjYmUzM2Q3MGE4MTAw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"With respect, Delegate," Diego interjected, his hologram flickering slightly as he gestured toward the display, "these are no longer theories. SIMU has recovered tangible evidence."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMDY4NzJmODQyYTQ5YTQ5OWUzODAxMmJjMWI0Y2E2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The hologram changed again, displaying complex energy readings and psionic wavelengths. Dr. Nikki rose from her seat, stepping forward to address the Chamber.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZWI5ZmMwNzBkMzRjYmI4MThkZjI3NTc2MWJlZWQx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"What you're seeing are neural-psionic patterns induced by direct contact with a Crystal fragment," she explained, her voice carrying the authority of her medical expertise. "These patterns indicate unprecedented synaptic resonance and enhanced cognitive pathways."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ODFjMTlmOGVmODQ3ZjJiODZiMjFkYjE2ODgwMzc5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Would you mind explaining in plain English, Doctor?" Vivian Kim requested, leaning forward with evident interest.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMDE2ZWNkZGE3NDQyNzFhOGM5MDIxNjhiYjEyOGFl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Crystal's influence can align thought patterns across multiple subjects," Nikki clarified. "In controlled settings, this manifests as enhanced receptivity to suggestion and cooperative behavior."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYzc5ZGRmM2E4NDQ3OGE4YWE5ZTY2NWE5MGM1MWUz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"So, mind control," Dante stated flatly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YzdjNjM4YzJkMTQxN2VhMTFhMGIyY2ZkNTE4ZjJm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"More nuanced than that," Artak corrected. "Think of it as... creating an environment where minds are more receptive to certain ideas. The subject retains their will but becomes more inclined toward specific thought patterns."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTE3MGI0NGI3MzRkNWViYjc1Y2E5NmU0OGVhZTVi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lawrence Campbell's eyes narrowed. "And you've verified these effects?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NTBkYWFlZjRiMjQzODNiYWQyODEwY2Y0OTQ5NzQ4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"We have," Artak confirmed. "Under strictly controlled conditions with voluntary subjects."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMjRhNmU5NGEzYjRhZjJiYTY5OGY4OGY3ZjZjNWIy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I'm sure," Dante muttered skeptically.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYjQzYTkwNTRiMzQ0NTNiMDQyZmZiY2Y4OGI2MGI3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Artak continued smoothly. "The Crystal's potential applications extend beyond mere influence. Our research indicates it could revolutionize everything from market research to conflict resolution. Imagine diplomatic negotiations where parties are naturally inclined toward cooperation rather than competition."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOTdkMGRlNzMwMDQ3ODk4ZDBhYTA2ZjEyNDQyOTlj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">President Harrison, who had remained silent until now, finally spoke. "And if the Imperium claims and deploys the main Crystal first?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OTExYTBkOWMxZjRkNTk5MWU1ZGIxYjk4NjQwMWEz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Artak turned to face him directly. "Then we face a future where Emperor Sun can sway populations toward Imperial ideology without firing a shot. Economic policies, resource allocation, military expansion—all could shift in the Imperium's favor through subtle influence rather than overt force."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMTFiYWZjNjQ5MzRiYzdhYzY3M2ZjNDM0M2ExMTBl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A tense silence fell over the room as the implications sank in. Elijah Montgomery broke it with a soft cough.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YmI5ZDRmOTNmNjRhYWNiNDFmNjMwMDcxYzFjYWUz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You're requesting the same funding increase as before?" the elderly representative of Boston Financial asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNWYzOWEzYmMzODQ0ODdiOGI1MTM2N2I4ZDkzYTBi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"No," Artak replied, earning surprised looks. "The situation has escalated. SIMU now requires a two hundred percent increase to our operational budget, plus dedicated resources from NexLink, Pan-American Defense, and Arctic Resources."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNWYzZTM5MjA2YTQ3MmE5M2Q4YWNkMDhjYjNmMTZm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Chamber erupted in protests, with Dante's voice rising above the others.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjFhNjk2ZDY3ODQ5NWRiY2QwMzYyYzA3ODcyZmJi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Preposterous! You've lost your mind, Otis!"</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMmY2ZmNlZWY1YzQ0MDBiYTUyNzAwNWI4ZWIyNGJm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Order," Harrison called, his voice cutting through the clamor with practiced authority. "Let the Director finish."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDUzOTg2YzA3MzRkNjViYTFmOGU4ZDc0MmUzOWU4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Artak nodded in appreciation. "The stakes have changed. This is no longer about gaining an advantage—it's about preventing a catastrophic disadvantage." He paused, his hand unconsciously moving to rest over the inner pocket where the Crystal fragment lay concealed. "The Alliance cannot afford to be the only major power without access to this technology."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZGUyNDlmNzI5ZDQyNTlhM2FiZmExNmY4ZDExNTg1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As he spoke, Artak felt the subtle warmth of the shard against his chest, pulsing in time with his heartbeat. His fingers brushed against the fabric of his pocket, and he closed his eyes briefly, centering himself.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiODc3NDkwMjNkOTQ0OTE4NDA3Mjk5YjIyMjNjNjA3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Sambandh ki sutra, adrishya dhaaga," he whispered, the ancient Devavāṇī words barely audible yet somehow filling the room. "Mujhe margdarshan de, tera niyantran pane ke liye."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNmI2OWIwYjVmZDQ5YzY5ZjYxMWIxMTIwMTFkMmQ0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Thread of connection, invisible thread, guide me to gain your control.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZjcwMTQyMTQ4NTQ5MDFiM2M2YjVlNWRiMDBhODcz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The words seemed to shimmer in the air, though none present could say they truly heard them. A subtle shift occurred in the room's atmosphere—almost imperceptible, yet undeniable. Several delegates blinked rapidly, as if clearing sudden fatigue from their eyes.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NmExYWM1N2IzZDRlNjBhY2FiNjUwMGU2MjkwM2Fk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Perhaps," Lawrence Campbell said slowly, his earlier skepticism softening, "there is merit in pursuing this technology defensively, if nothing else."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMjFhZjEyYjJhMzQ5NDk5N2VhN2FiZDFhZTExMTZh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Vivian Kim nodded. "The potential medical applications alone could justify the investment. Imagine treatments for PTSD, addiction, even certain forms of psychosis."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZTYxMzcwYzg2MzRkMmFiZjZhODdlOTE4MjJiMmRl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Markets could be stabilized during periods of irrational panic," Maya Williams added, her expression thoughtful. "Preventing economic collapses before they begin."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YjFlOGIwMjYxMTQwOWNiZjA0ZWU0OTYyZGEzYWE1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Only Dante appeared unmoved, his eyes narrowing as he observed the sudden shift in sentiment. He glanced sharply at Artak, then at Thomas standing quietly by the wall, whose expression had grown increasingly troubled.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OGQzNzk0YWU0MTQzZWQ5Y2E2MDMyYTJlYWM1MjQ2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You're all being played," Dante declared, rising to his feet with surprising agility for his size. "Something's not right here."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzk2MTY3Nzk1NzQzOWVhZTFkMjJmMDkxOWE1ZWU3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Delegate Pompeo," Harrison began, his tone conciliatory.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNTk1ODk1YTEwMzQ4MDI5ZmJkNGM0ODc2YzZkMDkx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"No," Dante cut him off. "Listen to yourselves! Ten minutes ago, you were questioning this entire premise. Now you're falling over yourselves to approve it?" He pointed a thick finger at Artak. "What did you do?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjg2MmNiZTUwYTQ4Mjg5OTgzMWI0ZDhhOTNmZTMy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Artak maintained his composure. "I presented the facts, Delegate. The Chamber is simply recognizing the strategic necessity."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZDUwZDg0ZmQwZTQ3YjJhNTIyY2Q3NWIzZmU4NGVj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Bull," Dante spat. "I've been in politics long enough to know when something stinks." He turned to the other delegates. "Can't you feel it? The sudden urge to agree? To comply?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZWRiNjMzMGI1MjQzYTI5NjAzZGMxZjNhZjYxMjNm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A flicker of uncertainty crossed some faces, but it quickly faded.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYTEyNGFkZGZmZjQxODlhMDA0ZGI4NGE2YTc5ZjFi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I think you're overreacting, Dante," Elijah Montgomery said gently. "The evidence is compelling."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNmYzNTdkYTc4MTQ3YWM4MzAzZDExZGIyMDlkZTM5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Indeed," Viktor Petrov agreed, though his brow furrowed slightly. "The potential risks of inaction far outweigh the costs."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YjljZjEwZWMwZTQ5NjVhNzU2NjA0MzIzNTllNDgx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dante looked around the table, incredulous. "President Harrison," he appealed, "surely you see what's happening?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZTViZDY4MDQyYTQzMTFiOTMwMzczMDQ1OWNmOWZj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Harrison's expression was unreadable, his eyes meeting Artak's for a brief, loaded moment before addressing Dante.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZmFlNzk4YWUyZTRhOThiZTMxMzY4ZDY1MWRhNWFi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I see a Chamber considering all options in a complex geopolitical situation," Harrison replied carefully. "Nothing more."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiODk3NTI5YWU1ODRjYjliM2NmYmIyMTg5NTY4NGYy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dante's face flushed red. "Then I demand a vote. Now. Before whatever this is progresses further."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNjg3ZjVjN2ZmMTQxZDNiOTBkYzRjMzUwNTAzZGI0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Very well," Harrison nodded. "Those in favor of approving Director Otis's funding request at the proposed levels, indicate your support."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNWEwYThhMDgxOTQ3NWNhMjdmOTdiODhiM2I3MDdk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Seven hands rose immediately—every Chamber member except Dante.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYTdhZGI1NWJjYTRjMzBiNWFmZjMzZDAyYTVlYzFi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Those opposed?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYzUxY2Y4YjQyYzQ1NThiNTk2ZGMwYmEwNmU5ODhl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dante's hand shot up, alone in its dissent.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YjBjMTdjODI3MzRjYTc5NWI2ZmM0ZjVkOGM2ZjE4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The motion passes, seven to one," Harrison declared. "SIMU's funding will be increased as requested, effective immediately."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZmNjM2NiNzQ2MDQzNjJiNjcyNGRjYjU3MzU5ZWJi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dante stared at his colleagues in disbelief. "You'll regret this," he muttered, gathering his papers. Without another word, he stormed toward the exit, the doors hissing open and closed behind him.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NDU0NzY4NDFhZTRhOGNhNmIzZThmOGFjZjJjZWEx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A moment of awkward silence followed before applause broke out among the remaining delegates. Artak accepted their congratulations with modest nods, though his eyes drifted toward Thomas, who stood rigid against the wall, his expression a mask.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxY2YwMGExMGZmZTQ5ZTc4OWQ2ZDkzOTYzYTcwNWVi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">President Harrison approached, extending his hand formally. "Congratulations, Director. Use these resources wisely."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NTAyNWRhOTI0OTQ4ZThiZmUyZWVhMTg5MzI4NzUy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Always, Mr. President," Artak replied, accepting the handshake.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZjg5ZTJhYjRjMDQ3Y2RhMjI2YzAzMDFlMmFhZjg1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Their eyes met, and in that moment, Artak knew that Harrison understood exactly what had happened. The President leaned closer, his voice dropping to a whisper.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMmRhYWYzZmE1YzRiYjI4MmUyMjQwMjNiYWYyNjlk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"We'll discuss the methods of your persuasion at a later date, Artak."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ODZjZjA3MGQ2YjQ4Nzc4ZDY5ZDY5OGVkZTQ4MWQ1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Before Artak could respond, Harrison had moved on, taking his position at the head of the table. The President straightened his shoulders, his posture transforming as he addressed the Chamber with renewed authority.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZmZiODJjMDYyNTQ4ZGNhN2RmNWEwZTY5MDljNzhm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Ladies and gentlemen," Harrison began, his Alabama drawl lending gravity to his words, "today marks a pivotal moment in Alliance history. We face threats from beyond our borders and beyond our understanding, yet we stand united in our commitment to secure humanity's future."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZTZiNTg3OWE3OTRiZGQ5OWEzYjk1YmE4MjBkMGMw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">His gaze swept the room, making eye contact with each delegate in turn.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOTFkOTNjZjQyMjRjNGViNzI4M2VlNTk0NzJiMWFl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The path forward will not be easy. It never has been. From the ashes of the United States, our forebearers built something stronger—a nation that balances liberty with pragmatism, opportunity with security. The decision we've made today honors that legacy."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NDEyNjM3NTBkZTQwZjk5MmQ2MWVmYWM3YWE4MWEw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Harrison's voice deepened, taking on the resonant quality that had won him five terms in office.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MTE3MWUyY2JkOTRiOTNiMDc3MGZkOTk5MzdjZmVk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Let history record that when faced with extraordinary challenges, we responded with extraordinary resolve. When our competitors sought advantage, we refused to concede. And when the future of our people hung in the balance, we acted decisively."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNDkwNjE0OGI4OTQ3NDRiM2M3M2Y1OGJhMGNmNjBi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">He nodded toward Artak, though something in his eyes remained wary.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMjE4M2Y4MWZiYzQ3MzZiZDUwOTI3Y2VhNTk0MTA5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The increased resources allocated to SIMU represent our unwavering commitment to safeguard Alliance interests across the Five Realms. Director Otis, the Chamber entrusts you with this mandate. Use it wisely."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOTE1NmUwZjY3NzQ1NTQ4Njk1MDQwZDkyMGY3NmIw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As the delegates filtered out, exchanging handshakes and quiet congratulations, Dr. Nikki approached Artak, concern evident in her expression.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NWJhNjA2ZjlmYTRhZTdiM2QyZWYwYjI5OTcwZWY0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The headaches will start soon," she murmured. "And possibly auditory phenomena. I have medication prepared."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYzVkMDQ5Y2Y5ODQ1ZDc5ZDYwNmMwYTEzM2U1NjRm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Thank you, Doctor," Artak replied quietly. "I'll come by your office later."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMDMzMjhlMmZmYzQ2YTE4ZjVjNDliZjE0NDM2YWQx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Diego shifted uncomfortably beside him. "That was...effective."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNDA2Mjg2Mjg5MzQzZWQ5OGJiMTk2NWJiYWZjZmQ1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"It was necessary," Artak corrected, though there was no triumph in his voice.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlODc0OTc3OTA1OTQzMmQ4MDY4Y2QwNWU2ZmU4MmI2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Sir," Thomas joined them, his voice pitched low, "what you did—"</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNzExODJhOTZhNjQyYWZiODM1NzBhNDkzZmM5YWYx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"What I did was securing our future," Artak interrupted, the first hint of defensiveness entering his tone. "The Crystal is too powerful to leave in the hands of our adversaries."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiM2NiMzFiNWI5OTRjNTk5NTRmZDJjZDUyNjNmODc2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"And too powerful to use without consequence," Thomas countered, his bionic hand flexing unconsciously. "You've told me that the ends don't justify the means. That was before Lorna or Emmanuel joined us."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZjNmZjI1ZDM4ODQzNzBiZTZiNTU4OTkxMDYwN2Mz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Artak felt the first throb of pain behind his eyes—the beginning of the headache Nikki had warned him about. "Sometimes, Thomas, principles must bend before they break entirely." He winced slightly. "We'll use this power responsibly. That's what separates us from the Imperium."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwN2U2YjdjZDM4ZjRjNjc5Y2JlMzY1NWY4NzUxZmQx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Is it?" Thomas asked quietly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTk4YjVjYTFiYzRjODBiMzVjZDZiZTk0ZmQ3Nzcy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Artak had no immediate answer. The shard in his pocket seemed heavier now, its warmth less comforting and more insistent.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MWU0YjUzZTFhYTQ1MGM4MzI5MjliMGM5NjI5Yjlm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As the last of the delegates departed, Artak found himself alone in the conference room with Thomas, Diego, and Dr. Nikki. The holographic display of the Crystal still rotated slowly above the table, casting blue reflections across their faces.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMDg1MDQ2NGFkMTQ0NjdhYzE4MWIxYmFiOGVmMzJl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"We've crossed a line today," Thomas said, breaking the silence. "One we can't uncross."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZjU3YzNhOGM4MTQzMTU4ZjMzYjdlNWE2NTRmNjc1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I know," Artak admitted, his voice suddenly weary. He reached into his pocket and withdrew the velvet pouch, the Crystal shard's glow now visible through the fabric. "And I suspect this is only the beginning."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzM2VlOGRkMWYyOTRkNGM5MGEwOGE4ODU3ZWIwOGZj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The four of them stared at the pouch, each contemplating the implications of what had transpired and what was yet to come.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZDc2YTVmOWIzMDRmODU4OTMxZjQwYTUwMDkzZTEz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">In the silence, Artak thought he heard whispers—countless voices speaking in unison, the words unintelligible yet somehow familiar. He closed his eyes, hoping to shut them out, but they only grew clearer.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMDk5ODA3NTY5MjRkYTg4Yzc2OTI1MDM3NmZkNDIw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Chandra ki, Dhool, Mann ka Saagar..." the voices seemed to say.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OGEwNmE4MWY4MDRmMjZiMDFhYzViZGY2MTllYWRm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Dust of Moon. The Ocean of Minds.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NjljZDA5NmFlMDRmMTViNDYzMmQ5NGE5ZjQ2ZGIy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The beginning of the Final Activation—the very section Nikki had explicitly warned him against. Artak felt a cold shock of recognition ripple through him. He hadn't spoken those words, hadn't even thought them. Yet somehow, in his consciousness, the voice from the shard was trying to advance to that forbidden portion of the chant on its own.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MWM4MGM0ZTc0NDQ3NDE4NGYxNDQyYzkxYjE0ZGM5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Director?" Nikki asked, noticing his sudden pallor. "Are you alright?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNmM2M5MDVkODNlODRlZDlhMDExNTlmYmJiNDc3ODlm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Artak forced himself to nod, though his hand trembled slightly as he returned the shard to its pouch.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMTM2Y2NlNjJmNjRjMWY5ZWIwZWU2MzQ3MmRkYTQw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Just the headache you predicted." he lied, unwilling to admit a deeper worry.</span></p>
