<p class="cnM0YjVkMTJmYjRiNDRiY2I5YmJiMDAyNWYxNDhhMmUx" style="margin-bottom: 0">Pulling my cloak up and making sure my helmet was on tight, I trudged across the sand towards my destination. Beside me, Arthree rolled along the sand with no problems, while Revan’s projection floated silently beside us, looking around with interest—his holocron tucked safely away inside one of the droid’s hidden compartments.</p>

<p class="cnNmZDAxM2ZjNDNlODQxMWI5OGMzMDI5NGRmM2ZiZGQz" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Have I ever mentioned how much I hate deserts?” I asked as we topped a rise and spotted our destination—just a short distance from where I’d landed the <em>Rusted Silver</em><span style="font-style: normal">, so as to avoid any potential issues that might come with excavating the site.</span></p>

<p class="cnNiYWRhYWU2ODBiODQ4OWJhMmMyMzA0ZWYxNjA4YzNi" style="margin-bottom: 0">Below us stood what was left of the site of Qigong Kesh, the only other functioning Tho Yor temple ship. All but the very top was buried, swallowed by perhaps thousands of years worth of sand. According to the holocron I’d taken from Akar Kesh, this was the site of one of the nine Je’daii temples scattered across Tython. This particular temple was dedicated to the study of mental and sensory skills.</p>

<p class="cnNhZTE3MDVjNWFiNjQ1Y2E5MDYyODQ5NDQwNmY4Y2Zj" style="margin-bottom: 0">Given the state of Akar Kesh and how it had been mostly stripped of everything of value, I wasn’t expecting to find much. If I was lucky, maybe a holocron with some old techniques.</p>

<p class="cnNhMWE1MTI1NWI5ODQ4NDJhYjdhODdkN2ZkNWM4ODNm" style="margin-bottom: 0">Of course, <em>old</em> didn’t necessarily mean <em>bad</em><span style="font-style: normal"> or </span><em>useless</em><span style="font-style: normal">.

<p class="cnMwNmNjNWY4NjNmNDRlYmNhNDk2NjRmNTQ0NjlhODhk" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">Technology had been discovered, lost, and rediscovered countless times over the millennia, and in many cases old tech that was dug up out of some archaeological site dating back thousands of years could be more advanced than anything we had on the market. Just speaking with the memory of someone from ages past showed that the Jedi and Sith of that time were on an entirely different level from the Jedi of this time. So, given that anything I found here could be five thousand years old or more, it was entirely possible that it would be superior to whatever techniques were their equivalent in this day and age.</p>

<p class="cnMyMWRkZWI5NTg4ZjRmMDRhYjk1YzRhNjA1ZDA0Mzhj" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal">We</span><span style="font-style: normal"> </span><span style="font-style: normal">eventually stopped halfway down the slope to the ship. Looking at Arthree, I asked, “Where is the upper hatch?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZGY2YWU4NDUxODQyN2Y5ODE4ZGE0MGQ1NGI2ODRl" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnMxODg5MzljZWI2ODRlZWJhOWU2ZDFiNDg4YTQ5M2Zm" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">The droid beeped and projected a hologram, showing the buried structure taken from scans we’d taken while flying over. Looking them over, I nodded and focused on the ship below—or rather, the sand before it. Sand erupted in a geyser as I pulled, a solid stream of it flying into the air and landing further down slope as I cleared the area around the hatch. Until eventually, the hatch was revealed and I felt that enough of the surrounding sand had been removed that it wouldn’t collapse back down and cover the hatch, trapping us inside.</p>

<p class="cnNiZDg1MGJkNDM1YjRlZTY5ZmU2N2RlNzNkMjNkNTFj" style="margin-bottom: 0">Once more, I had to force open the locked outer door, before we could get into the airlock. Once we were inside, we made our way towards the center of the ship as we lad last time. All of the Tho Yor seemed to follow a similar design and, judging by the leftover remains inside the ship, it looked like it had been used much as Akar Kesh had.</p>

<p class="cnNkMGFkYTA1NzBkNTQxMTlhYTVlOWQwNDM3MWNlMGQ4" style="margin-bottom: 0">We made it down to the central meditation area or whatever purpose it had once served and I smiled at what I found waiting. “Another holocron.”</p>

<p class="cnM2MDc0NGRlNGZmMjQyMzRiYTdmYzM1YTQwNDc1NTA0" style="margin-bottom: 0">Picking it up, it connected to my mind much as the first one had. I let it and found a practically identical system to the first. Unlike the first, this one was entirely dedicated to storing techniques, not philosophy or history. Grinning, I tucked it away into my bag after putting it back into sleep mode and we made our way back out.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZmM0YWNjOWYxNTRkODVhMTlhMjU4OTcwOWI1ZmJi" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM1NmM3OTEwYTY0NzQ3NzA5NzEyZDc5OTNlOGNiYWM0" style="margin-bottom: 0">Pulling off my helmet and cloak as we made it back inside my ship, I tapped my wrist controls to recharge the suit’s contained atmosphere while taking my seat. I was going to try for one more of the Tho Yor temples today, then at least do a flyover survey of the other sites listed in the Akar Kesh archive.</p>
<p class="cnM1NGNiY2I4NmU3MDQ0YmM4OTg5ZGMyZGZjMTY4ZTY3" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM3M2JlNjU3MDMwZjRmMmY4M2QwMDVjYTI5NDU4MTNi" style="margin-bottom: 0">Plotting a course for what should be Mahara Kesh, the Temple of Healing, I left my seat as the ship lifted off. “Arthree, take over for a bit,” I told the droid and made my way back to the fresher to knock the dust off and relieve myself.</p>
<p class="cnNmMjMzOTA1MWY1NDQ0NWFiNWExZjZhODk2NGZkNzBl" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnMwNDZmYzM3MjcwMzQ0OTY4ZDYxZjcyNzY5NWE3NWYy" style="margin-bottom: 0">I was just finishing up lunch when the droid chirped and I felt the ship slow to a stop. Picking up my plate, I made my way forward to the cockpit. “What have we got?”</p>
<p class="cnNmODkwZmFiZDNhYTRjZGQ5YTBkODFmNjc3NTM0MzYw" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnNhYWMwMDUxODE2MzRhYjM4OTVjNjFlMzA5MjBjOGUz" style="margin-bottom: 0">A diagram popped up on one of the displays and I read it over. Below us was a structure jutting up from the ocean. It had once been a four pointed star, but time and water had eroded much of the exterior. The ship it was built around was intact, but without power, and the interior was open to atmosphere. There were a few life signs, but given their sizes, and what I felt in the Force and with my emotion sense, they were likely just birds.</p>
<p class="cnNjMzkzMDZlZjI1ZjRhYTg5NDA3MzQxMjlmODM1OGUy" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM3ZGRkOTQ5MzQ0YTQ4MzI4NGFkNjI4M2M3YjBlODNl" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Alright, set us down there,” I pointed to the base of the temple, and the droid whistled. The ship moved and I hurried to put away my plate.</p>
<p class="cnMwNjQxZjM0YjAyMzRjNmE4MmI4ZTQ3ZmVhNTMyMjY0" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnNmNjgxMWJhYWZiMTQwMzc4N2E5NzQ3NTljZDAzYTRm" style="margin-bottom: 0">We touched down and I grabbed my helmet and pulled it on. “Arthree, stay here and monitor the scanners and comms. If this thing collapses, I don’t want the ship getting pulled down with it.”</p>
<p class="cnMzY2IxYmYxYTY4YzRkNmFiN2ZhNjk2NGZiNWE4NDQy" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM2N2VlYzFkODM1NjRjZWQ5ZjUzNjk0YmRmYWU4OTBh" style="margin-bottom: 0">With that, I opened the hatch and dropped to the ground. Making my way to the lower door, I opened the panel beside the door. Since the power was completely out, I grabbed a hydrospanner from my pack and fitted it into the manual door release. It didn’t want to turn, so I pulled my staff from its position on my belt and extended it, before wedging it in to use as a cheater bar.</p>
<p class="cnNhOGIxMTE0OWIwMzQ2NmE4ZTNkYmZhOGIyNGU2MjE5" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM3MGFkMDI0MmZmYTQxYzBiYmU1YzdhZTEwZjlmYWZk" style="margin-bottom: 0">With a bit more force, I felt and heard the rust break loose and the spanner turned. I retracted the staff and put it away, then quickly worked the door open. The interior door required the same manual entry method, but this time at least I didn’t have to break out the staff to break it loose.</p>
<p class="cnM2ODBhMDg1NWE3ZDQyMDZiYmUxZmZkODViMjJlOGIz" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM3OTRkMDFhNTYxZTRjOTdiYTQ4ZGVmOWYyMTZmYTZh" style="margin-bottom: 0">The interior was overgrown with lichen and the floor slick enough that I had to activate my mag boots to keep from slipping. My suit’s lights played over the surroundings in a way that gave everything a creepy feeling, like some isolated, long abandoned deep sea research facility, and even though I felt no danger in the Force and no emotions other than birds around me, it was still creepy in a way that made my hands itch for my lightsabers or blasters.</p>
<p class="cnMwYmM5NWI4ZWNiYzQ0MDhiMmEzMmJhYmI5OGRiZTgx" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM1N2NiZmUyMjQ3MDQxZTI4MjQ1OTFmNjY1ODUyZTAz" style="margin-bottom: 0">Despite the eerie atmosphere however, no creatures jumped out at me. No parasites burrowed through my suit to make their home in my brain. No tentacles yanked me into their lair to do the sorts of things one would see in a doujin or hentai.</p>
<p class="cnMwNDA3NTY4YWJiNDQ0Y2M4ZTgwNTkyYzFlMjkyYmUz" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnMwZDJmZjU1MjFlNzRiNDY4YmI2ZWJmOTdhM2Y2ODY4" style="margin-bottom: 0">I found a third holocron exactly where I expected to and left without incident—a quick perusal of the table of contents equivalent showing that it contained medical knowledge, both mundane and using the Force. I made my way back to the ship and we were soon airborne and heading back to base.</p>
<p class="cnMxOGRhNjk3YjI0NTQ4ZjViYzgzZDhkZGE2OWIwOWNi" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnMzNTdjZWVhYzJlOTRmYTBiNDI5YjEzYzgwOTFjMWI4" style="margin-bottom: 0">Stripping out of my vac suit, I put it in the fresher to get clean and changed into my robes, noting that they were getting tight and short in places, and my armor would need adjusting again soon. Once I was finished, and the sonic shower shut off, I stowed the vac suit and took the helm. Reaching out, I mentally pinged the holocron containing Revan’s engram. He appeared behind me and I looked over my shoulder for a moment, acknowledging him before going back to monitoring my instrument panel.</p>

<p class="cnNmNmMzMjkwZGIxYzRiMWRhNDMwODUxZDUxOGViZDJl" style="margin-bottom: 0">The man nodded. <em>“Yes. This sort of thing would be seen as a test of loyalty. Learning the information within would be permissible, but you would be expected to turn the holocrons over for review. The </em><em>Akar Kesh holocron will likely be put into some archive of dark artifacts somewhere, as it contradicts the current teachings of the Order. The other two would, at best, be put with the rest of the Jedi holocrons and access restricted only to Masters in good standing.”</em></p>

<p class="cnM3OTNjZTdmZDcxNTRkMmVhYTAxZDA2MTFhNDg4YWJj" style="margin-bottom: 0">Wind whipped through my hair and my heart pounded in my chest as I pulled up sharply, my stomach flipping like the world’s best roller coaster—except this was a roller coaster entirely under my control. The Force alerted me to danger and I jinked left, then down as red blaster bolts streaked past.</p>

<p class="cnNiOGExN2E2YjE1ZjQ5NzhiZDhiNGFjZTljYTFkZjYy" style="margin-bottom: 0">Laughing, I flipped upside down and pumped the air brakes, killing my air speed and allowing the Mando OpFor team to close in. Raising my rifle, I sighted them down and fired a short, three round burst for each. The rifle was in training mode, but each of the shots still carried the Force with it, and when they hit Beskar they made a very audible, clear note denoting my ‘kills.’</p>
<p class="cnM3Yzc0MjEwZWY4YjQzNzE5MzEzOTNkNGJlMDM5NDVh" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM1M2ZiZDEzOWM2MzQyYjE4ZGJjYmE1ODY5NDQ3M2Y4" style="margin-bottom: 0">I dumped altitude and charged them, jinking between streams of fire as they tried to keep me away, but it was useless. I’d danced through <em>much thicker</em><span style="font-style: normal"> fire on the Rhine front and other battlefields and all of this was just a </span><em>friendly warmup</em><span style="font-style: normal"> compared to that hell.</span></p>

From what I understood from speaking with our Mandalorian pilots, standard doctrine for atmospheric combat was to slow down and engage the enemy well inside the range of blasters and try to conserve missiles since they were practically useless against other fighters due to poor targeting systems that had difficulties hitting anything smaller than a cruiser in flight and built in countermeasures on fighters being capable of handing them. </span><span style="font-style: normal">On the other end of the spectrum, space fights were done at full speed, but damn near knife fighting range.</span></p>

Reminded of a thought I’d had during my training against our two fighters, I grinned and added, “Actually, think you can send me a full body personal energy shield with it, to go on a belt? I need one for a little project. I’ll wire you the money. A non-lethal option for capture would also be appreciated.”</p>

She has improved somewhat since I first spoke to her and it couldn’t hurt to strengthen that relationship.</em></p>

I needed to let the science and security teams know that we’d be packing up. I needed to use some of our lab equipment meant for fabricating hazmat suits to scan my body and sent off the results to Jaster, along with authorizing a credit transfer for the shield. I should call Master Qui-Gon and verify that everything was okay. I also needed to make sure that the holocrons I’d created matched the contents of those I’d copied their data from.</p>
