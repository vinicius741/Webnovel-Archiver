  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I need..." Lorna's voice trailed off as the Space Rover suddenly lurched, tilting sharply to one side. "What the fuck?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin's hands tightened on the steering wheel as he tried to correct their course. The Rover's wheels spun uselessly, sinking deeper into something that hadn't been visible moments before.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "We're stuck," he announced, killing the engine before it could overheat. The sudden silence amplified the soft squelching sounds coming from beneath them.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna peered out the window. What had appeared to be solid purple ground was actually a thin crust covering a bog-like expanse. The crust had collapsed under the Rover's weight, and now thick, gelatinous fluid was slowly enveloping the wheels.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Great," she muttered, reaching for the door handle. "Let's just…"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Assess the damage." Xin finished for her.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The moment her boots touched the bog's surface, Lorna felt the strange consistency – neither fully liquid nor solid, with a peculiar elasticity that seemed to respond to her weight. The air around them had changed too, filled with tiny luminescent particles that drifted like pollen.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Don't breathe too deeply," she warned, covering her nose and mouth with her sleeve. "Something's not right about this place."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin stepped out on his side, studying the bog with newfound interest. His pupils had dilated slightly, reflecting the bioluminescent particles floating around them.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It's...beautiful," he whispered, lowering his hand from his face. "Can you feel it? The energy here?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna circled the Rover, assessing their situation. The vehicle had sunk about thirty centimeters into the strange substance. "We're definitely stuck."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She glanced up, noticing Xin hadn't moved. He stood transfixed, staring at his hands as tiny green sparks danced between his fingers.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Xin?" Alarm crept into her voice.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I can see it, Lorna." he whispered. "The Aether. It's everywhere. Flowing through everything. Through you, through me, through this place." He looked up, his eyes wide with wonder and fear. "So this is what it's like?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna approached him cautiously. "It's the spores in the air. They must be triggering your Aether." She touched his shoulder. "We need to focus. Get the Rover out of this bog."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin nodded, but his movements were dreamlike. "Yes, the Rover. Though I can feel the bog's energy. Like a heartbeat." He suddenly lurched forward, clutching his head. "A bit too much. Too much at once."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Around them, the bog began to pulse with light, responding to Xin's distress. The luminescent particles swirled faster, creating intricate patterns in the air.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Xin, listen to me," Lorna said firmly, gripping both his shoulders now. "This is your first psionic experience. The spores are amplifying everything. You need to find an anchor, something to focus on."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "An anchor?" he repeated, his voice strained.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yes. When I first discovered my abilities, I focused on my pendant." Her ivory fingers touched an absent space at her throat. "Find something tangible, something real."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin's eyes found hers, his pupils so wide that his eyes appeared almost black, verdant lines of wisps dancing in them. "Okay. You." he said simply.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That's not…" she blushed.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You're my anchor, Sigrún Fjeld." he insisted.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Before Lorna could respond, the bog around them surged. The gelatinous substance rose up in waves, flowing away from them in concentric circles. The Rover shifted as the material beneath it changed consistency.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What's happening?" Lorna demanded, bracing herself as the ground continued to undulate beneath them.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I think this place is alive," Xin said, his voice steadier now. "It's responding to our emotions. To our Aether."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna watched in astonishment as the bog continued to pulse, the patterns becoming more complex, more deliberate. "It's like…" she whispered. "…a massive sensory organ?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yes, or a neural network. Part of Shashan itself, maybe," Xin agreed. He closed his eyes, concentrating. "The spores are not just triggering my abilities. They're... communicating."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The waves in the bog settled into a gentle rhythm, matching Xin's now-steady breathing. The Rover, previously stuck fast, now rested atop a firm platform of the strange material.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Can you understand what it's saying?" Lorna asked, fascinated despite herself.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin's brow furrowed in concentration. "Not words exactly. More like... impressions. Emotions." His eyes flew open suddenly. "It's warning us."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "About what?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Danger. Coming from..." he pointed toward the horizon, in the direction they had been heading. "There. Where this Primarch Moro is."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The bog pulsed again, more urgently this time. New patterns formed in the swirling particles – shapes that looked almost like creatures, moving in formation. Hounds with bones sticking out their rotten flesh, and giant stink bugs in dark shells, long antennae on their heads.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Those look like Radi-Mons…" Lorna said, squinting at the miniature light show. "Have we seen these before?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Fenris Horde." Xin whispered. "Is the bog showing us a Fenris incursion?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna's hand instinctively went to her neck, searching for the comfort of her missing pendant. "If they're attacking Shashan..."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Then the Rakshasa are about to be at war," Xin finished. "And we're caught in the middle."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The bog surged once more, creating a clear path for the Rover – a solid bridge stretching toward Moro's mountain.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It's helping us," Lorna realized. "But why?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin turned to face her, the green sparks between his fingers now forming more coherent patterns – crude but recognizable. "It senses something in you."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I honestly doubt it." Lorna murmured.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "We need to get to Moro," Xin said, the dreamlike quality leaving his voice as determination took its place. "Whatever's happening, we need to warn them."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna nodded, her earlier anger at Xin temporarily set aside in the face of this new threat. "Can you drive?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I think so," he said, flexing his fingers. The verdant energy dispersed. "The initial shock is wearing off. I can control it better now."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As they returned to the Rover, Lorna paused, looking back at the bog that had nearly trapped them. "When I first discovered my abilities, I was terrified. I thought I was going insane."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Did you?" Xin asked, his hand on the driver's door.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yeah." She met his gaze. "It happened that night, after Sven and my...first time."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Uh…Sven?" He raised an eyebrow.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That's what Skarn was called when he was human." She offered.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He nodded slowly. "You were very close."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yeah." She said again, feeling heat rising on her face as she bit her lower lip. "Thought I'd get pregnant after we did it. Instead…the Aether in my nucleus awakened."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I see." He replied.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "We'll talk about it later," Lorna said, climbing into the passenger seat. "Right now, we have bigger problems."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Rover's engines roared to life, and they sped along the solid path the bog had created for them, heading toward the looming mountain and whatever awaited them there.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Behind them, the bog settled back into its deceptively peaceful state, the luminescent particles gradually dimming – but not before forming one last pattern: a violet phantasm, a perfect replica of the pendant hanging around Lorna's neck.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   And — as she narrowed her sapphire eyes to see — another figure took form, in the shape of a wingless dragon.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A Diabolisk's phantom standing behind hers?
  </span>
 </p>
 <span>
  <br/>
  Taken from Royal Road, this narrative should be reported if found on Amazon.
  <br/>
 </span>
 <p>
  <span>
   But the phantasms faded away before she could discern anything else. The Rover lurched forward, carrying her and Xin away.
  </span>

  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Space Rover's engines quieted as it stopped at the summit. Lorna unfastened her seatbelt. The landscape looked strange — purple grass and bent trees surrounded a massive Bodhi Tree at the center.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Here we are. The Summit of Bodhasya Parvatah. The location that Vyom gave us," Xin said, breaking the silence, pronouncing the Devavāṇī name easily.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna stepped out of the Rover into the strong mountain winds. She shivered despite her high-tech turtleneck and beige trench coat. Her blue eyes scanned the alien landscape.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Here, you might need this," Xin said, handing Lorna some flatbread she had left in the vehicle.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She took a bite reluctantly. At first, it didn't taste great, but soon she recognized the flavor of Hickory-Smoked Ham. With each bite, it tasted better until she finished it, feeling warmed through.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I made that bread with Kathrin," Xin said hesitantly. "We used one of the food supply crates from the Rover. Emmanuel said you always liked the ham."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The wind carried strange chanting sounds. The Bodhi Tree seemed to pulse with energy, its roots submerged in glowing green liquid that reflected on the purple grass.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Where exactly are we supposed to meet this Primarch Moro?" Lorna asked, sounding both awed and uneasy.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin checked his Quantum Watch. A green hologram appeared, showing their location under the giant tree. "Vyom instructed us to meet him here."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna looked around for any sign of the Primarch, her fingers touching the spot where her pendant used to hang. Its absence felt like a void.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As she approached the green liquid around the tree's roots, she noticed its smell: sweet like overripe fruit mixed with a sharp sulfur scent.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What is the green liquid?" she asked, though she suspected the answer.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "My watch says it's Helionite," he replied, watching the pool. "It seems this tree feeds off of it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Rakshasa must have been growing trees like this one," Lorna said, disturbed at the thought of such a being living off what fueled humanity's nightmares. "Are you sure this is the right place?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I'm not sure, actually," Xin answered casually. "But the Rakshasa people have been fairly forward with us so far. If Vyom says this is the place, then I trust him."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna sighed and continued scanning the area as the wind howled through the grass and trees.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Suddenly, a purple branch extended from the Bodhi Tree, holding her pendant. It glowed blue, revealing what had been hidden.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lines in the tree's bark began forming a face - serene and ancient, with half-closed eyes and a calm expression. The face had prominent cheekbones, a smooth forehead, and lips curved in a knowing smile.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The face looked wise yet distant, like someone in deep meditation. The bark around the eyes was slightly wrinkled, with a long nose and flared nostrils. It seemed timeless, as if it had grown with the tree over thousands of years.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Then Lorna realized - Moro wasn't inside the tree; Moro was the tree.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Xin," she whispered, staring at Moro's forming face. "This tree, it's alive."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   From beside her, Xin murmured, "The face. It looks like that of the ancient Buddha."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Moro's voice echoed in their minds, deep and amused. "Kathrin has informed me of your visit," he stated. "But I am not Buddha the Awakened One. The ideas that gave rise to your sages and gods are not unique to Earth, child. Your journey as a species is but one branch on a vast tree."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna stepped closer, searching Moro's bark for any hidden intention. "So, you lead the Rakshasa Horde? Are you a Radi-Mon?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Moro's expression shifted. "The Rakshasa Horde has thrived throughout millennia without a dictator. I advise young Kathrin and Vyomendri as they coordinate the Sholo-Yu that follow our way."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Do you owe allegiance to Skarn?" Lorna pushed firmly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I existed long before Skarn even took his first breath, child. Sholo-Yu like us - what your people call Radi-Mons - were created by a larger collective consciousness with a mission to consume the Helionite produced by civilizations that have discovered cold fusion," replied Moro, his deep voice rumbling slowly. "But so far, young Skarn's Fenris Horde has left this system untouched. Kathrin assures me that our hordes have maintained a respectful distance from each other."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "How or where do you obtain your Helionite?" Xin asked.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "In the previous eon, this system was home to a society that utilized cold fusion. We co-existed peacefully until they tried to enslave us. My horde retaliated and assimilated them," Moro explained, his words carrying psionic energy.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Assimilated?" Lorna raised an eyebrow.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Until recent centuries, we've been self-sufficient. But the Zephyrium reserves across our planets and moons are depleting quickly. Draugs like Vyom sometimes venture to the Sol System to retrieve Helionite. Through occasional trading and interaction with a scholar named Harald Omdal, we've become aware of the Moondust Crystal."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin moved closer to the tree, looking wary but curious. "So, the Moondust Crystal," he said carefully. "What can you tell us about it?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Moro seemed to acknowledge his question. "A tool meant to contain and mold the psionic potential of entire species," he said. "Crafted by the Nirbohs to keep your ancestors from becoming what the Hivemind has become. Yet, even the Nirbohs misjudged the fires of creation."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna folded her arms. "That was a lot of buzzwords you just spat out."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Crystal was made under the belief that Nirbohs alone should rule the cosmos," Moro's face remained still. "The universe would be a better existence if such an artifact was never created. Or deployed."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "And yet, you took my pendant, knowing its jewel's a part of it," she said defiantly. "You want the Crystal, don't you? What's your game?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Moro laughed, a sound like stones falling down a canyon. "I do not seek to use it, if such is your concern."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna stepped closer, the pendant's glow lighting her face. "If you don't plan to use it, give it back. It's mine."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Ownership," Moro looked at her with an unreadable expression. "An honest and mortal expression I understand."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   His branch lowered the pendant within her reach. The only sound was the pulsing Helionite at their feet.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna reached for the pendant, noticing its blue jewel glow brighter as her fingers approached.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   But when she tried to take it, Moro's branches wrapped around her, lifting her into the air. She screamed as the tree sap soaked through her clothes, spreading a cool, tingling feeling.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Oh no you won't!" Xin pulled out his 10mm Magnum and aimed at Moro. Before he could fire, another branch grabbed him and lifted him beside Lorna. His gun fell to the ground.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Du dumme tre! Should've known this was a trap…" she spat, trying to sound calm. Moro studied them curiously before responding.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Those who created the Moondust Crystal sought to subjugate all Radi-Mons," Moro's voice echoed in their minds. "So enlighten me, Lorna Weiss. Why should I allow you Sol people to restore and deploy such a weapon?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna struggled against the branches, feeling the pendant now back around her neck.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She clenched her jaw and focused her psionic energy. "Let me go, or I'll kill you myself! I have the power!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Moro seemed amused. "You bluff, dear child. Your strength is impressive, but not enough to harm me."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As he tightened his grip, Lorna felt her psionic energy draining. She panicked slightly. "We need the Crystal to stop the Fenris Horde. If we don't act, countless lives will be lost. It's the right thing to do."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Right or wrong," Moro said, "such subjective concepts hold no sway in the vast expanse of the universe. Why would the Rakshasa, safe here in the Realm of Eternal Bliss, involve ourselves in your remote and petty squabbles?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Fordi det er vår jævla verden!" Lorna's Norwegian accent thickened as she shouted, "Because it's our fucking world! And we will protect it!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "And die trying, your kind will," Moro replied calmly. "I still see no reason for my horde to intervene. If you Sol people can't protect your own realms without relying on a Nirboh creation like the Crystal, perhaps it's time for your era to end."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The wind roared as Lorna grew desperate.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "If the Fenris were to annihilate humans and claim the Sol, they would become your worst enemy," Xin said, meeting Moro's gaze. "They too consume Helionite, which you Rakshasa rely on. What's preventing them from turning on you?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna watched as Moro considered this. She held her breath, looking down at where her pendant used to be.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Very well," Moro finally said, loosening his grip and extending his branches. He gently placed them on the purple grass, away from the Helionite pool.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The wind swirled around them as Moro's branches retreated.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I trust you understand not to use it against my people," The tree lowered a branch with her pendant. As she put it back around her neck, she felt safer.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I promise I won't," she whispered, barely audible over the wind. She glanced at Xin, who looked relieved.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Before they could speak more, a violet portal appeared, casting light across the grass. Vyomendri Nyāya and Kathrin Gwynn emerged, looking grave.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Primarch. There's been an attack on our moon!" Vyomendri exclaimed, his violet skin almost matching the portal. "The Fenris Horde is upon us!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Moro's face twisted with surprise. "Impossible. Skarn gave his word that Fenris would respect our territories."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "They were sighted on Parivartan Ghas in the northern hemisphere. 'The Twisting Meadows', in you Sol people's tongue," Kathrin turned to Lorna, her serpentine body coiling anxiously. "Three Hatching Chambers have already been destroyed. They're targeting our Helionite reserves."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna narrowed her eyes. "I thought your hordes were cool with each other?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "So did I," Vyomendri confirmed grimly. "I suspect it's due to the recent skirmishes in the Sol's Five Realms. I might have led a few operations which saw us aiding the humans."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Vyomendri. How long have you been working with humans?" Moro demanded, his branches swaying.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vyom straightened. "For a decade now. They've been supplying us with extra Helionite straight from the Five Realms' fusion plants, as well as other resources and meat. In return, we aid them against occasional Fenris incursions. More efficient than having our Weavers scavenge small deposits."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Fenris Horde knows how to travel between star systems?" Xin asked.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kathrin nodded, her white serpentine body reflecting the portal's light. "But not at such speed. I suspect they've managed to conjure a portal of their own."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What if," Lorna said, touching her pendant, "they're not just attacking your moon. They're sending you a message. Join them..."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Or be destroyed," Moro finished, his features hardening. "So be it. If Skarn chooses to break faith, then the Rakshasa Horde will answer in kind."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The wind carried distant battle sounds. The tension felt thick as storm clouds.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Tanha has gathered her Jalraks in the Meadows," Kathrin told Moro, looking at Lorna. Her wet black hair fluttered in the wind. "Emmanuel is with her."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Moro said, "Then take Lorna Weiss and Zhi-Xin Wu with you. One has displayed bravery, the other wisdom – qualities that will be crucial in the battle to come."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Space Rover," Xin said suddenly. "We can't leave it here."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kathrin smiled slightly. "Worry not. I'll have some Weavers retrieve it later. Right now, you must press on."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Ready?" Lorna asked Xin as she reached inside her trench coat's pocket, drawing out the Psi Shield to affix it onto her ear. The device hummed to life, its silver shell glowing blue.
  </span>
