<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnMxNmY5ZDg5Zjg4NDQyM2JiMGNmODVkZTk2ZjY5OGEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">The house, when they finally went inside, still had all the furniture from Terrance’s childhood. It was slightly dusty, but not overwhelmingly so. The only thing any of them could think of was that somebody came by every now and then to maintain the place. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1MTNhNTZhMzQ3OTQ0MGE4NWFiZTQ4Y2I5MGVlMGE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so, it was incredibly convenient. There was enough room for everyone, just as Maeryn had hoped. And with the window drapes closed, no one should notice that the building was in use. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhMzFhMzUwMjk1NTQ5Y2RhYmJkM2U1YTA3N2E5Yjk4"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was the obvious problem of procuring food, but Terrance assured them that it wasn’t an issue. He walked them all to the master bedroom and shifted the enormous king-size bed in order to get behind it. Then he reached into a hard-to-spot drawer in the back of the headboard, where a dozen sacks of coins lay hidden. “We’ve got all the wealth we need for now,” Terrance said somberly, obviously remembering his parents. “And I can take care of the shopping.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YjQ3NGM1YzhjZjQwOTdiZGExZmZkYTkyMjhhZjhj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn touched his arm, trying to convey her appreciation and support. “Are you sure? If there are places nearby then maybe one of us can take care of it. If you don’t want people to know you’re back, I mean.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM4NjRhMTExOWRiYzQ5MmE4NThlYjc0ODczZjUyMTI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance gave her a wan smile. “It’s been eight years. I’m sure nobody will recognize me, and if they do I’ll just claim wrong identity. I have no plans to reveal that I’m alive until after I’ve gathered enough influence in the underworld. And…” He clenched his fist, eyes unfocusing as he looked off into the distance. “... until I’ve settled things with the people who killed my parents.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlMmUwZjI5NzJlNDRhYjI5ZmMxNWE2ZTc0ZDY1YjZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn could only nod in silence. Erina had a lot to answer for, if their suspicions were correct. But they couldn’t focus on her right now. She turned to address the group as a whole, and they automatically quieted, giving her their full attention. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5OGJiY2JjMTk3NjQ4MTRhNDE5YjhlMWU1ZjExMDMz"><span style="font-weight: 400">It made her stomach squirm. They were treating her as a leader again, when she’d already demonstrated that she wasn’t up to the task. But… Maeryn had to step up. She swallowed her nerves and discomfort and tried to focus on what she had to say. “Alright, people. We’re here, which means that - thanks to Terrance - we’ve got a roof over our heads and we’ll have food for me to cook in a little bit. Next step is figuring out what’s going on with our airship, but we shouldn’t lose momentum on the holy mana research. Ernesto, Dan, report. Where are we at?”  </span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZWUwMjFiZTVlZDRmMDc4ZmFhODYwMmQ3Mjc5ZWM3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan cleared his throat. “We’re making rapid progress, I believe. With Ernesto’s recent breakthroughs on the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Spirit </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">spell line of necromancy, he has what I believe to be at least a basic grounding on the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Cold, Acid, Rot, </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">and</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Spirit </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">concepts. All that’s left is…” He swallowed, shifting his weight from one foot to the other, visibly uncomfortable with finishing his sentence. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZmE5ZGQ3OWMzMjRmYzZhMGQ4MjNmOGFmNGNhMmYx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“... is </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Undead</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” Ernesto whispered, his face twisting in distaste, discomfort and fear. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxMjljMzRlNDI4ZDRlNWY5NjdhOTQxMzU3YzM1MWRk"><span style="font-weight: 400">He wasn’t alone in that. Everyone present grimaced; while it was inevitable that he’d need to do it eventually, it was still an unpleasant, forbidden, and most importantly </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">dangerous </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">requirement. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiMzMwMDg5ZjIzNjRhOTY5OTBhOThkNjlmNmRhYTAz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“At least, that’s what we think,” the necromancer continued. “It doesn’t make sense to try inverting necro mana until I’ve done at least a little with that. And we’re obviously not in a place where I can safely practice raising the Undead, so for now I’m practicing and exploring the other concepts. Mostly the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Cold </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Spirit </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">spell lines, since I can practice those without destroying anything.” He looked up pensively. “There’s a link with those two, somewhere, I’m sure of it. I just don’t understand it yet.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNkMTRkMzgzYzVhYjQyODZiNzcyOTE4NmQ0OGVlNmRj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m going to have him summon Keith later and see if we can get a lecture from him about the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Undead </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">spell line of necromancy,” Dan continued from where Ernesto left off. “If we’re lucky, then Ernesto might only need to raise one Undead, just to put everything together.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjOWZiMTc0MDI1MTRjMjViN2NjZDllMGIyYTU4MTU1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can we front-load any of the next steps?” Frankie asked curiously. “Like, what do you need to do after you have the inverted necro mana? Is there anything you can do some prep work for, while you’re waiting for a safe place to, um, practice raising an Undead?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzRkN2NhZTc5NzRhZmNiOGFlZWIyYTE5YzY1Mjhm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan lifted his hand and held it palm-down, fingers spread, making a so-so gesture. “There are a couple of things. I was able to derive a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Necro Resistance </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">rune sequence based on the standard </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Flame Resistance </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">rune sequence, which will serve as a proof of concept once we have inverted necro mana to power it with. I’ve also done some preliminary research on what a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Purify Mist </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">rune sequence might look like, assuming that inverted necro mana has the properties that I believe it will.” He shrugged. “But I’m not comfortable continuing down that line right now. I don’t like working off of assumptions if I can avoid it. We need to get through this bottleneck first.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3YWRjM2E4NjYyZDQyOTRhNThhY2U2NjNkOGY2ODk2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Frankie nodded thoughtfully. “I get it. No point in building an entire airship with brand new materials if you don’t know that the materials are up to the task. Gotta do stuff in order.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM2Y2FlYThlZTNhYzQ1YmZiN2ExZDQ1MjhhYzg5ZjE3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yep.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZmIwNzFhYWYwZDQ2NjlhZDJjZjZkYmFhY2RkMjkw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good work,” Maeryn cut in, trying not to let the conversation get too derailed, even if she was thrilled that they were much closer to the goal than she’d expected. In a matter of weeks, they almost had a solution ready. It made the last several years of struggling against Critical Mana Depletion seem laughable, infuriating, and incredibly sad all at once. “Terrance, after you’re done shopping, I want you to come back and take a nap. Frankie, Peter, you too. The three of you will be doing reconnaissance tonight to see what’s going on with Stonewing, and you’ll need to be well-rested for it.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMWIwOGExNTU0YTRkOWQ4Nzk2YjUwM2U2ZmY2MmFi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait. Why are we going along?” Peter asked, confused. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjMTJlZTRjZmI4ZTRhY2JiODhlNDRjNDFkNDlkMGRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because if I were trying to make sure that we couldn’t take our airship, I’d sabotage it. Make it unable to run,” Maeryn explained coolly. “So I need my engineers to double-check that it hasn’t happened, or to figure out how to fix it if it has.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDEyODJjNjdiNDRkY2RhOGJjMzAxMDFkYzc0N2Y4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh. That makes sense.” </span></p><span class="cmIwNDY5NGQ4MWM5YTQ3OWJhMzk0OTA2NTAzNjhmY2Ix"><br/>This story has been unlawfully obtained without the author's consent. Report any appearances on Amazon.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM0MmVmN2U2NDQ3MDRiYzA5ZTdiNWI2ZjlkMDExMjMx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Frankie looked up at Maeryn, a wildness in her eyes that Maeryn rarely saw. “Wait. You think they hurt my baby?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmMjM5ODRiZjY5NjRjZGViNWY0NTdjYTRmODA3NTk2"><span style="font-weight: 400">The hunter nodded, carefully not taking a step back at the look of rage that overtook her engineer’s face. “Again… that’s what I’d do in their situation.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMxZmZmMWZmMjk3YzRmNjA4ZWY0YjAyYTYxMDQwNTM2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Frankie’s hands flexed, reaching for a wrench in her toolbelt. “If they have, they’re gonna regret it,” she hissed. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2M2I4MjAyMDkzNzRjODFhMWIyNmY4MGZhN2I4ZDY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance clapped Peter on the shoulder. “You certainly can pick ‘em, can’t you.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMxMjE0Mzg3MDJjZTRhYzRhZDc2MmRjMDlhZDJmOGZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-w-what?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDhhZjM1ZjM5NTRkMjI5YmNmNmY3NDVhNDYzMDVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance’s smile grew absolutely wicked. “I mean, if she’s that protective over her airship, how protective do you think she’s gonna be with your actual kids?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwMjc5OGJjYmJiMTQzYmY5ZjJlMmZlMzE2OWNjNTli"><span style="font-weight: 400">Peter’s face went pale, then rapidly turned bright red at the insinuation. Quickly looking around for any kind of help - and seeing only wry amusement all around him - he sputtered, looked at the ground and muttered, “Evil. You’re all evil.” Then, an idea seemed to occur to him, and he smirked. “Frankie! Terrance is teasing me!” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhZjE0ZTFjNzczNDQzMjA4ZjYyYzU0NzJhOGZkNjMw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Frankie promptly kicked Terrance in the shin, then, and the rogue yelped, hopping on one foot and clutching the injured limb. “Ow! Are you wearing steel-toed boots?!” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyMTZkMGZhMWVjZDQwYjQ4OGE1NzRkZWJjYzNlNTEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course I am! I’m an engineer. Gotta protect the toes from random falling stuff. But you leave him alone,” Frankie threatened, pointing her wrench in Terrance’s direction. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiNDI0NjQ2ZjMwZTQ0ZDViZWUzMTkxOWJlNGZmOWE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Got it! I’ll leave him alone, just don’t kick me again! Jeez, you kick like a mule…” Terrance grumbled, rubbing his poor shin. “Maeryn, your engineer kicked me!” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5MGZmYzM4NTFkMzQzOTVhYmQ4NjdkZDEyMWFmOTFl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry. You had it coming,” Maeryn told him ruthlessly, receiving an over-the-top pout in response that had her struggling not to burst into giggles. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhNzRlMDZkZThjMzQ3MTY5YzQ4YWMyZGJjMmU5ZGZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">The others had no such compunction, and for a long moment the group dissolved into laughter. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4OGZlYWY2NmIxYjRkNDhhMTZhNGZhYzhiZGUzMTc5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“In any case,” Maeryn finally continued, as soon as everyone was mostly in control of themselves again - she didn’t think the grin she wore was going anywhere anytime soon. “We have our plans, people. Let’s make it happen. Peter, Frankie, off to bed with you. Not together, though.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlMDMzNjZiNWE2MzQ4MjJhYjkwMjQ2OGJiYWUzMmJh"><span style="font-weight: 400">That set off another round of laughter at their expense, and Frankie - bright red - visibly wound up for a kick to Maeryn’s shin this time. The hunter hopped backwards in time to avoid it. “Terrance, shopping. Dan and Ernesto, research. I’ll get the cooking started once Terrance is back. Unless anyone’s got something they need to talk about, meeting’s over.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5ODVkODZmY2IwMDQxMmY4ZmFmNmI4YmI5MzU4OTcy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone went their separate ways, in generally high spirits. Frankie lingered behind for a bit though. “I’ll have my vengeance,” she swore quietly enough that only she and Maeryn could hear. “When you and Terrance start dating, I’m going to tease you mercilessly.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhZmZhOTNlZjExODRhZWM5MTRjMDQ0ZGI3NmQ3OWZk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn raised an eyebrow. “And what makes you think that’s going to happen?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM1NWU3ZWRiNWVlMzQ4M2E4MWQ3N2I1ZmZjZTc5MzM0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Frankie stared at her as if she’d grown another head. “Are you blind? Even when he was mad at you, with good reason, he forgave you awfully fast.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjODUzZWZiYzVhNjQ2MDJhNjViNDI3Zjk2NTA0ZTE0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn shook her head in denial. Frankie just didn’t get it. “That doesn’t mean anything.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZTNiZGMzYTQyNDQ5YTRiOTA5ZDY0MDU4ZjI3ZmE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her friend huffed, sounding as though she were having to explain steam burns to a child. “He talks to you more than anyone else. And you have similar senses of humor. I bet he’s already gotten you a gift that was really thoughtful and didn’t make a big deal out of it.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZmEzMWE2Mzk3ZDQ1ODY4ZGM5MDk5ZjRlODk5MDBk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn made a face, remembering the guitar waiting for her on the airship. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlZTY2N2NiY2JhNjQ2ODM5ODRlZGRjOGNlZmE1YTcz"><span style="font-weight: 400">The engineer nodded triumphantly. “And it’s not like you’re opposed, is it?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM2OTY1NzcwMjcyNDQ2NGE5OGVlYjlhYzBkOTU4OGFm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I…” Maeryn sighed. “It’s not going to happen, Frankie. At least not anytime soon.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlMzcwZWIzNTAxMDRiYzc4N2U5ODAzMzA3MDI2YThj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why not? What’s stopping you?” Frankie pressed. “I mean, if he likes you - which I think it’s pretty clear he does… and you’re interested - which I’m pretty sure you are… where’s the problem?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwMGJlYWQzNzIzMzQ3ODRhNTNiNzhhZjQ2MWUzYmJk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn inhaled sharply. Frankie wasn’t going to let this go unless she spelled it out for her, was she? Fine. “The problem,” Maeryn began, her voice tight as she struggled to rein in her frustration, “is that it’s impossible. I’m the Captain. That means I have to be the flint-faced abyss bitch that prioritizes the mission, no matter what. Even when it hurts my crew. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhZjRjZGNlMzViODQ2OWM4ZjZhMWQwMjlhM2UwOGYx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look at what I just had to do with Terrance,” Maeryn continued, her voice rising despite her best efforts. “Do you really think that’ll be the last time I have to do something like that?”  Because I don’t! That’s not the kind of thing that can be forgiven in a romance, Frankie! And don’t even get me started on all the hunters I’ve seen fall apart after dating each other. It always ends up more bitter and awful than Lakehollow Black Tea! And when one’s in a position of authority over the other, it gets real Depths-damned ugly.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZTgyY2JlZDM3NTQxODFhNjcxNjIzZGEyNGI0NGMx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Frankie raised her hands, wide-eyed, clearly caught off guard. Seeing this, Maeryn took a couple of deep breaths and lowered her voice. “It’s impossible, Frankie. And even if I were stupid enough to try, as soon as we’re done saving the world Terrance is going to be throwing himself into the criminal underground to become the next Nightingale. Not exactly fertile ground for a relationship, is it? So no, Frankie, it’s not going to happen.” Maeryn slumped. “We’re friends. That’s it. That’s all we can be.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmYWY1ZDM5NDExODQzYTM5MDBiNzg1OTVkNzhmYjZm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her friend waited a moment, clearly checking to see if she was done, before Frankie pulled Maeryn into a hug. “I’m sorry, Rin. I didn’t realize this was a sore spot. Or that we were putting so much pressure on you.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMzAxYmJhM2YxNjQ1N2NhZDQwNDVhNDBmMjZlOTA2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine,” Maeryn murmured, wrapping her arms around Frankie and squeezing. “Everyone’s got their role to play. You and Peter take care of transportation, Dan and Ernesto are the star researchers, Terrance is amazing at his rogue stuff, and I’m the Captain who tries to make sure everyone’s got what they need. It’s not like I can help in any other way. The Mist isn’t something I can fight and kill.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhZjc4NTI5YzU1MTRjZDQ4ZjE0ZTliZDhiZTE3M2Vk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, maybe not the Mist, but you certainly kicked ass at the ZRC headquarters, and back on Cloudreach,” Frankie reminded. “So maybe don’t count out your own contributions just yet.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5YmU0YjJmNzExNzQzODNiYzNjNjhkMTFkNjk0Yzli"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn closed her eyes. Her friend was trying to make her feel better, but her mood refused to lift at all. She gently broke off the hug and took a step back. “You should head off to bed. You’ve got a long night ahead of you. I’ll wake you up for dinner.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmOTc5MjlmNTJkMTQ4M2E5MWE2MGE3NzdhNmQ3ZmQ0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Frankie’s face twisted, like she could tell that Maeryn wasn’t really okay but she didn’t know what to say, before she slumped in defeat. “Okay, Rin. Try not to beat yourself up too much, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOGFiYTVmMzMzZDQ0YThiNjM3ODA3MWU4OWYxOGM2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll try.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0YWEwYzcxNjhhZTRjZDNhNGU5NmZiZTMzZWJmZGI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Accepting that was the best she was going to get, Frankie retreated from the room, leaving Maeryn alone in the master bedroom. She pressed herself against the wall and slid to the floor, feeling more like a failure than ever. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5M2Y3M2Y1ZjQxMDQ1YjFhNTJlMDY2Yjc0OTU5MTBk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Great. Now I’ve got Frankie worried about me. Some Captain I am.” She looked out the window, looking at the sky dotted with clouds. “At least it won’t be much longer. Dan and Ernesto are so close. We’ve just got to get our airship back, find someplace safe for Ernesto to practice raising an Undead, wrap up Dan’s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Purify Mist </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">rune sequence, and that’s it. Shouldn’t take more than, what, a couple of weeks? You can hold on that long, Rin. Just keep it together.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MjQ5YzdlYTc2YzQ0MWQ4Y2ExZGVmMWRhZmYyNjgy"><span style="font-weight: 400">She huffed a mirthless chuckle, the sound hollow in the quiet room, as she tried to imagine the future. “And when we’re done, we all go our separate ways. Dan and I go back to Geova, and Dan becomes the hero who saved our civilization from the Mist and returned mana to the people. Ernesto goes back to Airspire and does the same. Terrance stays in Zephyr and works on becoming the next Nightingale. Frankie and Peter… who knows? Maybe they’ll go to Airspire and just tinker with airships and get rich from innovations or something.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiN2ZkMDVjN2E1ODQyMTY5ZTdhMTMyN2UxOWYzMTMw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn closed her eyes. “And me… I guess I’ll go home and see if they’ll have me back at my old hunting job.” She wasn’t sure if the idea sounded nice or depressing, and she didn’t care to dig into her feelings further to find out. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlZmI3Y2Q3Y2E3NDQyYjc5YTM4MWE5ZTA4ODMzMTky"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just a few more weeks,” she told herself, even more quietly this time, wrapping her hands around her knees and tucking her head to them. “Keep it together, Rin.” </span></p>
