   “Hey, pass me that spanner, will ya?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Here you go!” Frankie agreed cheerfully, slapping the requested tool into her friend’s waiting hand.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Perfect, thanks!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Frankie’s day had gone absolutely wonderfully. She’d spent almost the whole day with the airship researchers, and they’d gone back and forth on designs for hours! Best of all, her new engineer buddy hadn’t even
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    once
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   lost his temper with her; instead, he’d gotten just as excited as she was, and the world had almost fallen away as the two of them fell into sync.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Now they were doing some tinkering on the airship in the yard to see if their thoughts about making the cockpit more aerodynamic by adding a “beak” of tempered glass was worth the extra weight the airship had to hold up. It would require adding a bit more weight to the back as well to balance it out, but this was a proof of concept, so they didn’t need to worry about that just yet.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   But if it worked as they wanted, then Frankie would have another way to make Stonewing
  </span>
<em>
<span>
</span>
</em>
<span>
   even faster! Her body was almost vibrating with excitement as her buddy - she still hadn’t gotten his name, and it felt like it’d be a bit awkward to ask at this point - finished tightening the last bolt. “Alright!” her friend exclaimed. “Ready to hit that switch and test it against some real wind?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “You know it! I’ve already got the measuring equipment set up on the bracing pad!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The boy laughed. “Perfect, lemme just get out of the way real quick, and then we can give it a spin!” He jogged over to Frankie, a wide grin on his face. The moment he joined her, he clapped his hand on her shoulder. “Go for it!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Frankie’s hand almost blurred as she flipped the switch, and she stared eagerly as the giant fan in front of the airship quickly turned on and began blowing air at incredible speeds to mimic the effect of the air while flying.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   After letting it go for a minute, she turned off the fan and impatiently waited for it to be safe to go and read the force measurement. The moment the fan came to a stop, she and her friend raced to the bracing pad. He got there first, which annoyed her only a little bit, but the way he whooped in triumph and spun to give her a high five told the whole story.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “It worked!” they cried out together.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “With this much force being saved, we can make the steam and mana fuel efficiency so much higher!” the boy enthused.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “And we can even get the airship to go faster, which will improve flight time and communication between the cities!” Frankie agreed excitedly.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Can you imagine how fast a personal airship with these kinds of modifications can go? Oh, I wish I could make one right now to try it!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Frankie groaned with envy at the idea. “Me too…!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Hey! Lovebirds! I’m glad you’re excited and all, but you gotta document your findings too, you know.” A middle-aged airship researcher gave them an indulgent smile even as he teased them.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Both Frankie and her friend blushed heavily. “R-r-right! I’ll get right on that, Chief!” the boy stuttered, not quite looking Frankie in the eye before he dashed off.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Chief walked over to Frankie and patted her shoulder twice. “Ya know, you’re really something, you know that? I’ve been trying for months to get Peter over there out of his shell, and you managed it in days. Course, if I’d known he just needed a pretty girl to impress…”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Frankie’s blush brightened, and she found herself at a complete loss for words. She’d never been teased like this before, and honestly had no idea how to respond. At least she knew her friend’s name now, though!
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Chief laughed. “Be good to the boy, alright? I’d ask you not to break his heart, but from the looks of it I’ve got nothing to worry about.” Still laughing, Chief walked away towards another group of engineers who were starting to argue over some blueprint.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Frankie stood still where Chief had left her, completely dumbfounded. He thought that… did Peter think…? Did she even like him like that? Peter was great, and she loved the way they worked together, and she’d never found anyone that really connected with her like Peter did, but they’d only known each other for a couple of days! Could you like someone like that after so little time?
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   … Frankie had no idea! “Where would I even go to research that?” she muttered under her breath. “Are there tests you can do? Gah! What am I supposed to do with this information?! No, no, focus, Frankie.” She slapped her cheeks a couple of times. “You’re here to spend time with your friend and have fun tinkering with airships together. You can research non-airship stuff later. If it becomes important. Which it’s not.”
  </span>
</p>
<span>
<br/>
  If you spot this tale on Amazon, know that it has been stolen. Report the violation.
  <br/>
</span>
<p>
<span>
   She steadfastly did not look in Peter’s direction, choosing instead to study the blueprint the two of them had made together to see if there were improvements that could be made to the design. When Peter joined her a few minutes later, both of them were very careful not to bring up anything that Chief had said, instead getting back into the rhythm of their work.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Eventually, though, it was time to go. The sun was close to setting, and Frankie really was starting to get hungry. “See you tomorrow, Peter.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Peter beamed at her. “See you tomorrow, Frankie.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Both of them pointedly ignored the Chief grinning at them knowingly, and Frankie hurried away to avoid being teased again. There had to be some kind of defense against teasing, there just had to be.
  </span>

   Days passed, then a week. Ernesto finished reading through his Master’s life story, and began going through the basic spells that Graves outlined for necromancy fundamentals.
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Chilling Touch
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   and
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Vitality Boost
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   were only the first two, apparently. The next was
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Lesser Acid Spray
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   , as Graves had termed it. It would, on a successful cast, create a thin stream of acid from the caster’s palm. The amount and distance it would reach depended on how much mana was injected into the spell, apparently, but Graves also noted that true mastery would allow for Ernesto to project the acid from a single fingertip, allowing for much better precision and control.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The young necromancer had been working on the spell ever since. It hadn’t taken long for him to get the hang of the basic spell under Dan’s careful supervision, but both of them wanted to make a sincere attempt to reach Graves’ “true mastery”, since having a stronger understanding of the
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Acid
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   concept behind necromancy would only help them in the end.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Unfortunately, all good things came to an end. Maeryn had done her best to stretch out their finances, taking up odd jobs that didn’t require leaving Airspire, but eventually it could be denied no longer. They were running low on funds, and would have to leave Airspire just so they could make the money they needed to support themselves.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I don’t like it any more than you guys do,” Maeryn explained over dinner. They were in the dining room at the
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Dancing Dragonflies
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   inn, and the place was only moderately busy. They had a corner table to themselves, and the buzz of conversation around them was quiet enough that they could hear each other just fine even if they lowered their voices to discuss sensitive topics. “But that’s where we’re at. We need to take a few delivery missions, or we won’t be able to afford to stay on Airspire.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Dan nodded agreeably. “I anticipated this would happen at some point. It’s not like we have an endless source of income. I assume you have a mission or two lined up?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I do,” Maeryn admitted. “The first one’s not too bad, just a trip to Mount Peace and back.” She grimaced slightly, remembering how creepy the place was. “It’s, um, an annual trip for this family to see their deceased family members. Shouldn’t take more than a day or two, but the pay isn’t all that great either as a result.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Makes sense,” Frankie said slowly, looking at her inquisitively. “What’s the second mission?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn looked down at her bowl, clearly uncomfortable. “It’s, ah, transporting a nobleman to Zephyr and back. For a trade deal. The trip itself will take about a week, and the trade deal could take anywhere from three days to a week. The nobleman will be paying for food and lodging while we’re in Zephyr, and we’ll have enough money afterwards to afford about a month’s stay in Airspire.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Wait. We’re going to be gone for three weeks?” Frankie interjected, sounding alarmed.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn nodded. “Basically.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Frankie took a deep breath, bracing herself. “When do we leave?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Tomorrow at ten in the morning. We’ll come back after the first mission, but leave the following morning for the second.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The engineer sighed a breath of relief. “Okay. I can work with that. I just have an errand I have to run in the morning.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn looked at her curiously, but at Frankie’s pointed silence, she moved on, looking at Ernesto and Dan. “Okay then… The family consists of a father and two small children. There’s enough room for everyone, but given that there’s little ones involved, I’m going to have to ask that you abstain from holing yourselves up in the lab while we’re on our way to and from Mount Peace.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Perfectly understandable,” Dan agreed, and Ernesto nodded along with him.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “It also means that you won’t be able to work on your
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Lesser Acid Spray
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   while we’re traveling. I don’t want you to accidentally eat a hole in the floor.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Oh, it wouldn’t do that,” Ernesto interjected. “Apparently the acid from
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Lesser Acid Spray
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   isn’t strong enough to actually eat through metal… and you were exaggerating to make a point. Sorry.” He hunched down in embarrassment.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn’s lips twitched. “No worries. If I can make a suggestion, maybe focus on something using the
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Cold
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   concept. It wouldn’t be hard to play you off as a novice ice mage or something if the nobleman asks.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I can do that,” the necromancer agreed. “It’s a little further in, but there’s a spell that Master called
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Necro Aura of Cold
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   that’s supposed to be the next step on the
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Cold
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   concept spell line. I can work on that.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Perfect.” Maeryn looked around. “Any objections, any important topics that need to be brought up?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I’ve got one,” Frankie said after a moment. “Have you heard from Terrance at all?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn slumped. “No, I haven’t. I think he ended up finding a team that he liked better, after all.” She sighed, then raised her head, visibly trying to shake off her feelings. “Anything else?” She received a round of shaking heads. “Right then. I’m gonna finish dinner, and head to bed early. We’ve got a long day tomorrow.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Actually…” All four of them turned to the side, seeing an awkward-looking Terrance holding one hand up in a lazy hello. “Is there room for one more? Looks like there’s a lot to talk about.”
  </span>
