   When the wake-up call came Vertigo was already awake, gritty-eyed and dry-mouthed from talking and drinking with Nathan and Bliss into the wee hours of the morning. Neither of them had taken the news well, Bliss rising from her seat to go pummel Commander on the spot, Nathan sitting withdrawn into himself, his eyes troubled. They'd talked in circles for hours about what it meant, what they should do, if anything was changed. “Fuck 'em all,” Bliss had slurred, waving her glass around unsteadily. “They've always hated us anyway, whassit matter?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As Vertigo strapped his gear on, he tried to work out why it
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    did
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   matter so much to him. The lies from a man who he'd looked up to almost as a father were a gut punch, but it ran deeper than that. Maybe it just felt like confirmation that all the hushed whispers, sidelong glances and avoided eye contact, every bit of behavior once people learned he was a Talent that said
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    monster, mutant, freak
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   , all of it might be true. He wrapped his scarf over his face as though for protection and stepped outside. Bliss and Nathan were waiting, and together as they had always been, they went to face the angel.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Nathan was still moving a little stiffly, an expression of pain occasionally crossing his face. Even with what help the camp healer could give and his natural accelerated healing, it was likely he'd be on the mend for a while longer. Commander was waiting with the angel a ways outside the camp, away from curious eyes. At the sight of Kaelan Vertigo halted, memories of their confrontation rushing back. Bliss paused beside him, toned arms crossed tightly over her chest and one hip cocked in a manner that was both confidence and challenge. Behind them Nathan formed the apex of their familiar triangle. Commander looked them over with a hint of weariness that said he knew Vertigo had told them everything. Vertigo didn't care; he wasn't going to be an accomplice in keeping Commander's secrets, not when they had a right to know.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Good morning everyone,” Commander said, too brightly. “I trust we all slept well. Shall I make introductions?” He gestured toward Kaelan, who stood with preternatural stillness, her silver hair catching the weak morning light. “Vertigo you know, this is Nathan, and Bliss. Bliss, Nathan, Kaelan is our newest recruit, and while you might outrank her, you probably already know she can kick your asses into next week and back. I recommend you treat her with respect. I also know you're probably not too thrilled about the idea of teaming up, but as usual, what I say goes, or you go.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Bliss narrowed her eyes, her jaw tightening. "So she gets to join us, just like that? After what she did to Nathan?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I did nothing he didn't invite by attacking me," Kaelan replied coolly, her silver eyes flicking over them all dismissively. "Your friend is lucky to be alive."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Lucky?" Bliss took a step forward, her chain writhing at her waist with a life of its own. "I'll show you lucky…"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Enough." Commander's voice cracked like a whip. His sunglasses reflected the morning light, making it impossible to read his eyes, but the set of his jaw spoke volumes. "Bliss, stand down. Now."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   For a moment, it seemed like Bliss might refuse. The chain slithered more aggressively, but finally, with a muttered curse, she stepped back. Nathan placed a steadying hand on her shoulder.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “If she managed to take all three of you down like sacks of useless potatoes,” Commander continued smoothly, “imagine what she’ll be able to do to Yolanda’s slave operations.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Silence dropped like a hammer. Even Kaelan’s disinterested expression flickered.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Why her?” Vertigo challenged. “How do you know she isn’t just going to turn on us and walk away laughing?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Commander's expression hardened. "Because I said so."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That's not good enough anymore," he snapped, stepping closer. Bliss and Nathan tensed behind him. "You owe us more than that."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Commander folded his arms. “Because there’s more happening here than you three realize. Kaelan is here because I made a deal, one that means I’ll be gone for a while. While I make arrangements for that, she’s going to help us take down Yolanda.” He nodded at Kaelan. “And for that to happen, you sorry sacks need to work together.” Bliss made as if to take a step forward, but Nathan quelled her again. “Now. I have reasonably good intel that there’s a secondary base in Etienne, one that she’s funneling a lot of her money through. We’re going to hit it, and hit it hard.” His gaze swept over them, lingering on each face. "Kaelan has skills you lack. You have potential she can help unlock. Together, you might actually stand a chance."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Against what?" Nathan asked quietly, speaking for the first time.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Against what's coming," Commander replied cryptically. "Now, I want to see how you work together.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “How powerful is their magic?” Kaelan asked.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Hello, we’re right here,” Vertigo mumbled.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Commander ignored him. “I haven’t done too much formal training, as I wanted to avoid attracting attention.” He favored her with a sardonic nod. “It seems, however, that we may be running out of time. Vertigo has the strongest raw power with a fire affinity. Bliss manipulates and senses metal. Nathan has the weakest outright talents with an earth affinity but his intuition is flawless.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Combat?” she continued.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Commander grinned. “I’ll let you see for yourself.” He gestured to the open field and settled himself in the shade at the base of a scrawny tree.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Bliss shot Kaelan a nasty smirk. “Ladies first,” she said, sauntering to the makeshift arena and casually twirling her chain.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan shrugged. “As you like.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   What followed was less of a sparring session than a grudge match. The two combatants darted in and out of range, Bliss’ chain a whirling blur. Kaelan hadn’t even bothered to draw her daggers; she dodged Bliss’ attacks almost casually, hands at her sides. This only served to make Bliss angrier, her attacks more reckless. “C’mon and fight me!” she spat, lashing the chain at the other woman’s head with enough force to shatter her skull.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Faster than thought Kaelan tilted to the side and avoided the blow. “You’re letting your anger get the best of you,” she said coolly. “Again.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Shut up!" Bliss snarled, her chain suddenly splitting into multiple segments that attacked from different angles.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   For the first time Kaelan showed interest, though she still managed to evade most of the strikes. One caught her arm, drawing a thin line of blood.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Better," she acknowledged. "But still not good enough." The next exchange happened too fast to follow. Kaelan blurred forward, slipped inside Bliss's guard, spun, and tapped the base of her neck with two fingers. “Dead,” she said softly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Bliss’ face flushed crimson. “Fuck you!” she screamed. She slammed her chain into the ground, sending up a small explosion of dust and gravel and leaving behind a small crater, and stormed off. Nathan made as if to move after her but Commander shook his head. “Let her go.” His expression was thoughtful, calmly cataloguing everything. Vertigo considered following her until Commander’s eyes landed on him. “Nathan specializes in ranged combat,” he explained to Kaelan, “so not much point in a melee match. Vert, you’re up.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo stepped forward and drew his sword, ignoring the twinge of unease that coiled in his gut as he remembered her show of power in the alley. She tipped her head at him in a mocking salute.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He attacked without warning, using the full reach of his huge blade to force Kaelan back. Unlike with Bliss, she drew her twin daggers, the metal singing as it met his sword. The first clash sent a stinging reverberation up his arms. She was stronger than even her muscular frame suggested; blocking that strike should have been near impossible.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo pressed the attack; he executed a series of powerful strikes designed to limit her options for retreat. Somehow she flowed around his blade like smoke, impossible to catch. Sweat beaded on his forehead as he twisted the blade in an attempt to catch her.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Sloppy footwork." She tapped his ankle mid-swing, nearly toppling him. "My teacher would have had you flat for that."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "My teacher only cared about results," he growled, bringing his sword down hard enough to crack stone. The near miss actually seemed to catch her off guard. He pressed the advantage, creating a wall of steel despite his burning muscles. Every time he thought he had her cornered, she’d find some way to escape.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “You rely too much on brute force and that oversized blade,” she commented. “That leaves you vulnerable to a faster opponent.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Only if they can get close,” he returned, finding the strength to execute a whirling spin of his blade that forced her back a few steps.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Like this?” Fatigued muscles stuttered and then she was inside his guard, bringing a dagger up to tap his breastbone-
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Faster than thought a hand came away from the sword’s grip and fire bloomed between them. A hiss escaped her, a lock of hair singeing in the wall of flame and her arm barely escaping the same fate. Kaelan stepped back, booted feet scuffing the sandy dirt. “I thought this was a sparring session,” she snapped, genuine surprise cracking her mask of calm.
  </span>
 </p>
 <span>
  <br/>
  The story has been taken without consent; if you see it on Amazon, report the incident.
  <br/>
 </span>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo shrugged, satisfaction warming him more than his flames. “As long as you get ‘em dead,” he reminded her. He was panting, dripping in sweat, and she looked like she’d been out for a morning stroll. There was no way he could hold out much longer. The air turned electric, ozone sharp in his nostrils. A warm breeze stirred Kaelan's hair as power gathered around her.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Good match,” Commander said. Her eyes narrowed at Vertigo and the breeze died.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Using your power to make up for a physical disadvantage is a good strategy,” she admitted, something like grudging respect in her voice. “Your fire is raw, untamed, though, and you’re liable to hurt yourself as much as your enemy.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He flexed stinging fingers, unwilling to admit that he’d felt the bite of his own flames just as much as she had.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Then that’s what we’ll work on next,” Commander called out cheerily. He settled himself more comfortably at the base of his tree, crossing his arms over his chest and by all appearances preparing to nap.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan sighed out a breath and sheathed her daggers. “Can you manifest your element?” she asked Nathan, abruptly shifting her focus. Something like insult flared in Vertigo’s chest at being so quickly dismissed. Nathan looked uncertain. “Sit down,” she told him. “And you… Target practice,” she instructed Vertigo. “You may have power, but without control and stamina it’s not very useful. I want you to hit the same spot every time. Let’s see how long you can keep it up.” Commander stirred as if about to say something but subsided as Vertigo glared at him and, to punctuate, slammed the rock in front of him with a fireball.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan sank gracefully to the ground across from Nathan. “We’re going to see if you can form a small mound of earth,” she informed him. “Look within yourself, find the presence of your power. Reach for the earth, feel its stability and energy. Earth is patient, enduring. Don't force it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo ground his teeth together as he scorched his palms with yet another searing blast of flame. If nothing else, at least he was being given a chance to work out his aggressions. He settled to focusing on nothing but creating and directing fire, trying to achieve that fine balance that usually eluded him, riding the edge between powerful strikes and conserving energy. Voices murmured in the background about sensing the earth, becoming one with rock. The cadences melded with the rhythm of his strikes.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The blackened rock face in front of him melted into slag as he hit it with a flaming sphere of lava.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan stopped dead, cut off mid-sentence. He blinked, unsure what had just happened. Commander was sitting upright under the tree, all pretense of inattention vanished. Kaelan stood and stalked over to him, a forbidding, intense look in her eyes. They'd gone opaque and hard again, the color of mercury or winter ice, and he froze pinned under her gaze. “What did you just do.” It was not a question.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo recovered enough to offer her an insouciant shrug.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan turned and appealed to Commander. “Did you
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    see
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   that?” Nathan stared.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Commander leaned forward. “Do that again.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Uncomfortable with all eyes on him, he shifted his weight and stared at the cooling rock. He reached for whatever had produced that effect, finding only ordinary fire at first. Then, with effort that left him drained, another amorphous ball of lava appeared, wreathed in a halo of flame.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Commander was giving him a strange, appraising look. Kaelan was staring at him as though he'd grown a second head. “What?” he asked, self-conscious.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Stabbing a finger at him, Kaelan declared, “That's impossible. You shouldn't be able to do that.” She turned to Commander again. “He just
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    mixed
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   elements, spontaneously!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Commander remained maddeningly noncommittal. “Interesting.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo's moment of smug satisfaction evaporated as Kaelan went on, “No
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    half-breed
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   should have enough power to do something like that! The amount of energy required, the control needed - it's impossible!”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Apparently not.” Commander was still fixing him with that measuring gaze. “Although it does raise several questions.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan took a deep breath, visibly regaining her composure. “Commander, if you want us working with that level of power,
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    which I strongly advise against,
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   we need distance from the camp. Significant distance. Before he levels it.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Less than amused by her estimation of his self-control, Vertigo snarled and started to say something but Commander interjected first. “Agreed. Nathan’s still recovering, and since Bliss is feeling uncooperative, looks like it’s the two of you. Mission prep first, and then you can go off for some-” he winked-- “alone time.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Whatever you say,
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    drazhar.
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   ” It was a sarcastic remark, and though Vertigo didn't recognize the foreign word, something about it struck Commander like a physical blow. His entire body locked rigid for one betraying instant, subtle enough that only someone who knew him well would notice. Emotions flickered too fast to read - shock, recognition, something that might have been grief - before settling into anger.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “That's damn well right, whatever I say. Mission prep, my tent, two hours.” He stalked away, leaving Vertigo and Nathan gawking behind him. It seemed Kaelan had a talent for getting on everyone’s nerves.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Well," Nathan said into the awkward silence, "that was interesting."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan's gaze lingered on Commander's retreating form, her brow furrowed. "Indeed," she murmured. Then she shook herself, the mask sliding back into place. "Two hours. Don't be late."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As they dispersed, Vertigo caught her watching him with calculation replacing surprise. The lava demonstration had changed something, shifted her assessment of him. Whether that was good or dangerous remained to be seen.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He had enough time before the briefing to clean up, grab food, and maybe corner Commander alone. There were questions that needed answering, and he was tired of being kept in the dark.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <hr/>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo arrived at Commander's tent early, determined to get answers. The guard outside, recognizing him, stepped aside without question. Inside, he found Commander sitting at his campaign table, staring at a glass of amber liquid he hadn't touched.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You're early," Commander said without looking up.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I want to know about Yolanda."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Commander's laugh was bitter. "Of course you do. Sit."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “I heard you abandoned her in Asapaco,” he said bluntly, remaining standing.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Is that what you heard?" Commander finally looked up, removing his sunglasses to reveal the shadows haunting exhausted eyes. "Sit down, Vertigo. You want the truth? Fine. But you're going to hear all of it." Reluctantly, Vertigo took a seat across from him. Commander sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. “It’s… complicated.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “What, did she not take the news that she’s some kind of hybrid freak well either?” he asked, voice dripping with sarcasm.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yolanda was brilliant," Commander responded, ignoring the jibe. His voice was heavy. "Talented, ruthless, absolutely dedicated to the mission. Everything I thought I needed in a second-in-command." He finally took a sip of his drink, grimacing. "She was also completely psychopathic, though I didn't realize it at first. Or maybe I didn't want to see it." He sighed, shaking his head. “I had no idea she’d gotten so powerful, or I would have warned you from the start.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Letting me know she could get into my head and dance me around like a puppet might have been a good idea, yeah,” Vertigo acknowledged sarcastically.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “It doesn’t work like that,” Commander corrected. “She can’t actually make you do anything, at least not without you realizing she’s done it. What she does is… she suggests. Slips a thought, or a feeling into your mind, makes you feel like it might have been your own.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo thought again about Commander, about his uncanny knack for making allies and coming out on top in negotiations, but kept his mouth shut.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “I thought she’d make a decent second, that I could curb those tendencies. Instead she took everything she could learn and only got worse.” His shoulders slumped as though with the weight of his past failures. “She took whatever she wanted without regard to the cost, spent lives like coin, terrorized the troops. Inevitably, she took it too far.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What did she do?" Vertigo asked, his voice low.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Commander's jaw tightened, his hands clenching into fists on the table. "There was a district councillor in Asapaco, the merchant quarter, who refused to grant us access to certain trade routes. Minor stuff, really. Could have been negotiated."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He paused, the memory clearly painful. "She orchestrated a massacre. Used her mind manipulation on an entire neighborhood - made them turn on each other. Families, children, elderly... all convinced their loved ones were enemies. By the time the screaming stopped, forty-seven people were dead."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo’s stomach dropped. "Why?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "To prove a point." Commander's voice was hollow. “To show what happens to those who deny her even the smallest thing. She wasn't trying to hide it. She wanted word to spread. Wanted people to fear her."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo sank into a chair, absorbing this in silence.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I had two choices," Commander continued. "Execute her myself, or let Asapaco's justice system handle it. They had evidence, witnesses; my scout testified.” He met Vertigo's gaze. "The worst part was that she was lucid. Completely rational. She knew exactly what she was doing and felt nothing. No remorse, no guilt. Just satisfaction at making her point."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Could she have escaped? From prison?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Commander's smile was grim. "Asapaco has ways of containing Talents. Special cells, inhibitors. But even if she could escape physically, where would she go? Every faction in the city wanted her dead after what she did. The prison was the safest place for her. She couldn't manipulate anyone from inside those walls." Commander stood, pacing to the tent wall. "Or so we thought."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Someone got her out."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Someone decided her particular skills were worth the risk." Commander turned back to face him. "And now she's free, running slave operations, drawing influence into her net. It looks like she’s learned to play the long game now and she’s got an entire city in her sights." He stood, brushing invisible dust from his pants. "That's why she needs to be stopped. Not just for what she's doing now, but for what she'll do if left unchecked.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo nodded slowly. The story explained not just why Commander had abandoned Yolanda, but why he was so careful with training him, Bliss, and Nathan. He'd seen what happened when power combined with the wrong mindset.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Is that what you're afraid of?" Vertigo asked. "That we'll end up like her?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "No," Commander said immediately. "You three have something she never did; a connection to each other, to something beyond yourselves. She was always alone, even in a crowd. Always hungry for more power, more control." He paused. "But power without wisdom, strength without restraint... that's a path that leads nowhere good."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Before Vertigo could respond, the tent flap opened. Kaelan entered, pausing when she saw them together.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Am I interrupting?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "No," Commander said, his professional mask sliding back into place. "We were just finishing. Take a seat. We have a mission to plan."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As Kaelan settled into a chair, Vertigo caught Commander watching him with that same measuring look from earlier. "Now then," Commander said, spreading a map across the table. "Let's talk about Etienne."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The immediate crisis took precedence, but Vertigo wasn’t done thinking. About Yolanda, about himself. Half-breeds and angels. And about the fact that Commander was still keeping secrets; just ones he couldn't quite identify yet.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Whatever was coming, whatever Commander was really preparing them for, Vertigo had the feeling it was bigger than just stopping a psychopathic slaver. The lava incident, Kaelan's presence, Commander's mysterious deal - pieces of a puzzle he couldn't yet see clearly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   But he would. One way and another, he'd figure out what game was really being played. And he was determined to be more than a pawn this time.
  </span>
