I consider it a sign of a lazy mind unable to properly convey how they feel or what they think without relying on expletives to either add emphasis or fill dead air—the equivalent to ‘ah’ or ‘um’ in someone’s speech, as their mind has to take a moment to catch up to their mouth. It takes exceptional circumstances to bring me to that point. As it turns out, most of those exceptional circumstances tend to be life or death situations, or the immediate aftermath.</p>

The only spots of good news was that they were all on the left side, so all of the pain was concentrated to one area, I didn’t appear to have punctured a lung and none of the bones were poking out of my skin, and I had gotten cold enough to have gone mostly numb to it.</p>

<p class="cnNhMTIyY2FjZDU4ODRiYzdiYTFlMjNjMDhiZjcxZWVl" style="margin-bottom: 0">Taking a shallow breath, I forced myself to sit up, painfully unsticking my frozen and possibly frostbitten skin from the ice. Closing my eyes, I centered my mind using meditation exercises taught to me as a mage in my second life. Then, once I was calm, I reached out with the Force. First, I felt within myself, confirming my state.</p>

<p class="cnM0Yzg1ZmMwZWRhMzRkYTlhNjQ1MmFlMTZlNDFjZjQ4" style="margin-bottom: 0">I was happy to note that only <em>one</em><span style="font-style: normal"> of those ribs was cracked and the other was just severely bruised and even a bit dented. The arm break was a hairline fracture. </span><span style="font-style: normal">Neither were </span><span style="font-style: normal">nothing that a stim pack, some bacta gel, </span><span style="font-style: normal">and a bit of rest wouldn’t see me walking off in a day.

<p class="cnNkMWRkZDA3MjQyMzQwYzQ5Y2QyM2JmYzc1ZGFjZWI4" style="margin-bottom: 0">Shifting my focus away from my wounds, I checked my energy reserve and sighed. I was running on fumes. The Force, for all my problems adapting formulas to it, worked surprisingly similarly to mana. The body generated it naturally, typically regenerating with food and rest. I’d had a short little blackout, but no actual rest. Nor did I have so much as a protein bar—another thing I’d have to add to any emergency kit. I would <em>not</em><span style="font-style: normal"> be caught unprepared again.</span></p>

<p class="cnNkZmI5YWM2YmFiMTQ0ZTJiYmJiY2Q3NDIwOTM1MTM2" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">Still, being unable to regenerate my energy supply internally at the moment didn’t mean I was out of options. Much as with mana, it was possible to draw the Force in from the environment—and at the moment, I was sitting in the heart of some kind of nexus, wellspring, or meeting of ley lines of the Force. The stuff was all around me. So, I reached out and began pulling it to me.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZGIxNWNlNjdiYjQ1NWZhZDgyOTU1YmJiODdlNTM0" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM5YjZkM2UzMzgzODRhNjBhZmZlZDkzODA5OGE1N2E2" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">The Force jumped, rushing into my body like I’d stuck my mouth onto a tap and opened it up all the way. For a moment, I nearly choked at the sheer volume, but I managed to get it under control. I felt my energy reserves rapidly refilling and sighed quietly with relief.</p>

This was both a blessing and a curse, because the pain came back as I thawed out. Gritting my teeth, I got to the ‘winging it’ part I had been dreading.</p>

I think I know what happened with the flight formula,</em><span style="font-style: normal"> I mused, mentally going back over those last few chaotic seconds. There at the end, I had stopped trying to force it, trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. Instead, I had </span><em>Forced</em><span style="font-style: normal"> it—that is, let the Force itself guide me towards something that would work. </span><span style="font-style: normal">And it had! The problem was that the flight formula was fairly mana intensive to begin with, which meant it was going to drink down the Force similarly. I hadn’t had enough to give, while also sparing enough for a mage blade to open a path in the wall, </span><em>and</em><span style="font-style: normal"> the mental strain of juggling both formulas. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0OTZkZGM5ZDY4MjRlYzRhOTM3NjhiNDgxNWQ1OGU2" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM4Y2FjYmY2ZjRmMjQ0OWZiZDY0MzQ2ZjI3N2QxMzc5" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">Sure, I could mentally juggle three without a computation orb normally—back in the Empire, anyway. And as long as they were simple things I had practiced and drilled to the point of being able to use them reflexively. Flight, mage blade, and a few others such as the shield and explosive formula were on that list. But since I was having to convert from mana to Force, I wasn’t quite there on the reflex part yet. It wasn’t second nature.</p>

Shifting the ball of light to a directed beam, I spotted several large creatures that looked like crabs the size of large dogs huddled around a large pool of water, fed by water dripping from the ceiling, and running off in a stream across the room and into a crack in the floor. A thought to the Force towards food and I grinned as they scuttled towards me, waving their big pincers.</p>

It dropped dead and I dodged back from a snapping claw from the other one, another mage blade taking the claw off at the joint for its attack, before I came in and stabbed it in the head as well. The third one turned and began fleeing towards the water, but I leapt after it, landing on top of its shell and stabbing down before cutting the formula.</span></p>

Eventually, I spotted a corner and frowned as I thought I saw the play of light and shadows. Temporarily killing the output from my light formula, I confirmed my suspicions—green, blue, purple, and a few other shades of light danced off of the wall ahead, along with the familiar ripple of the play of light off of water.</p>

Carefully catching it, I pulled it to myself. A chunk the size of my fist landed in my palm. One of the protruding crystals broke off and I realized that the smaller one was about the size I would need for a lightsaber. The larger one, I didn’t know exactly what to do with at the moment, but having a backup source of crystal would be handy.</p>

My arm and ribs felt a little better, but I wasn’t sure if that was the warm mineral water or the Force, or maybe my mind playing tricks on me. I took a few minutes to catch and eat another fish before setting out again, once more following the Force as it guided me across the cavern to an exit—this one with actual stairs carved out, albeit rough. But it was a good sign. It meant that people had once come down here and this was likely a path back to the surface.</p>

I quickly discovered that it produced more light the more Force I gave it, so I didn’t need my light formula going forward. Instead, I practiced my telekinesis using the Force by holding the smaller of the two crystals in place above me and feeding it enough energy to light the way, while I held the bigger chunk in my hand and felt it out.</p>

Momentum carried it forward and the two halves split as I grabbed them with the Force and yanked, sending them spinning to either side of me.

<p class="cnNhYjVlMGJiMjFkMDRlMGI4MGE1MDI2YmEwOWQxNjk1" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM1MWY0NmNhZDMzMzRhZjliMTRjN2UzZDYxZGI0ODU4" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<span style="font-style: normal">Come on, let’s get you back to the ship,” the girl hurried me over to the speeder </span><span style="font-style: normal">as she began to calm after seeing that I seemed to be mostly okay</span><span style="font-style: normal">. Pulling off her brown over robe, she wrapped me up in it before carefully hefting me up onto the seat and climbing on behind me.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YjZiM2I4OGMwZTQ3ZmI5NzI4Y2FkYWVhZDllOGQ5" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMzN2Y2MDczYjIyODQxOTY4OTRhMTRlYjBiN2Y3MDkx" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">I sighed and relaxed back into the larger girl’s warm embrace as she took off, angling my shield to keep the wind off of us as we went. Looking over the bike, I hummed, a grin pulling at my lips. “You’re going to have to teach me how to ride one of these.”</p>
<p class="cnNmMTA5YjJmY2FiYjQwMWI5ZTQyZmI1NDk4MGVmZmMw" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM1OGExOGQ3ODkzNDRmYTQ5NjI4NDJhYWMwMTQ2M2U5" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<span style="font-style: normal">Sure. Later. When we get back,” she agreed </span><span style="font-style: normal">easily.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNGU2YmM3ZjM5OTQzYzU4YzcwN2ZjMzE0YTJmZGQy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM1MWE4ZDZlYzNiYTRkZDk4NmJmOGY3ZDg2MDJhMTUy" style="margin-bottom: 0">The ride back was quick, with Obi flying us right up the rear ramp where she parked the speeder, before dragging me towards the one washroom. Obi called towards the front of the ship as she shoved me into the bathroom. “Master! She’s back, we’re ready for takeoff!”</p>
<p class="cnMwZWY0NmVmNWY0YzQ0YjM4NmI0YWQ5ZWE3YTJlMDgy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNhNTk4ZWI3ZGViYzQxNmE5ZDQ3NDIyNGNjODUwZDI4" style="margin-bottom: 0">A moment later, she squeezed in with me and I found myself assaulted as she quickly stripped me out of my robes and pushed me into the shower, before joining me. “I can do it myself,” I protested, only for the girl to glare.</p>
<p class="cnMxODljNGQ5ZDUyZDRlMjg5MTA4OTA5Y2IzNzE5ZjY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNmMzYwZTU1ZjBlZDQ0MTJiMGJlYmE1OGEzNjlmNDA0" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Quiet. You’re down an arm and you’re filthy. I’ll clean you up first, then we’ll treat the arm and the ribs. Then, you need sleep!”</p>
<p class="cnNkYzk3M2UyOTAxYzQ3NjBhYjk2YjQxZTFlNjkwODA5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM2MGUzODY1M2UxNzRjNWNiZjMyYTQ2MzQxZDJjNWQ1" style="margin-bottom: 0">Rolling my eyes, I sighed and endured as she proceeded to scrub then thoroughly examine me to check for any injuries she had missed. I closed my eyes and drifted for a few moments under the hot spray and the feeling of hands scrubbing my hair. I must have drifted because I suddenly jerked and nearly slipped and fell a few moments later.</p>
<p class="cnM3YjA5ZDhhNTU3ZDRhMjM4YmEyZmI2ZjAzYWFhNjIw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM5M2YyZTRmOGFlNzQ5MTY5NWE0ODA5MTdkMjM4ZDVk" style="margin-bottom: 0">Obi pulled me out of the shower after that and helped me dry off, before grabbing me a change of clothes out of her room. Once I was dressed, she gathered our dirty clothes and threw them into the ship’s cleaner, after pulling out my crystals. Then, she deposited me on her bed with my crystals and opened up the first aid kit. Soon enough, I had a bacta wrap around my arm and over the ribs and she hit me with some kind of hypo spray type injector that left me pleasantly numb.</p>
<p class="cnNlYjAxNDM3M2Q1ZDRhY2RiODdmNDAwZWM1MWU2MTJl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMyZDY3YWU3YTIxNDQ2OTQ4YzRmY2Y5OTU2NTVkNzYz" style="margin-bottom: 0">With a sigh, I finally dropped the combat stimulant/anesthetic formula. Immediately, I collapsed backwards onto the bed as my vision swam. Everything came flooding back as the stimulants wore off within seconds.</p>
<p class="cnNhNmFiNTBlY2JkYjQ0MDM4NjFiOGE2NGRhNThmNDA5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNlMDRmNDA5MDg2NTQ1Yjk4YmRjNTUzNGM2MGVkOThi" style="margin-bottom: 0"><em>Ah. Right. I remember now. The reason why I disliked using that formula. ‘Methe Tanya’ is a little… extra sometimes.</em></p>

<p class="cnNiNzEwZGRlNzYzMjQ5M2RhYzQ5NjQxNDM3ZjQ3NThm" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<span style="font-style: normal">Sleep,” the older girl ordered, arranging me on the bed and throwing the covers over me as she sat up at my side, pulling one knee up and resting her chin on it, blue eyes studying me where I lay. “You need to rest. Give the bacta time to work.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOTRkYTU3ZWYwZTQxYzU5ZTRjNmFkMzNiZDBhNjgw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM1NzA4MTEyMTYxZDQwNDI4MWE5MWFjMDgzNTU2ZmUy" style="margin-bottom: 0">Yawning, I closed my eyes and shifted a bit to get comfortable. Considering the now much happier emotions radiating off of the girl, I cracked an eye open and studied her.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZDhlMWNiYjlmZTQwZjZhMmRhZGU5MDU0MzU3ZmM2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNkMTYwZTA5NTdhMDRmNmE4NTBlZGE3YTFkMTIxZTcx" style="margin-bottom: 0">“What?”</p>
<p class="cnMyYmU3YjQwNzg5YjQwMzM5N2FhZGUxNTY5OGVhNWU5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM3OWQxZmYxM2NmYTRiMDM4ODM3OWVhZjU1ZGMyY2Nm" style="margin-bottom: 0">Considering how to ask what I wanted to know, I eventually gave a mental shrug and decided to just be blunt. “We barely know each other, but you’ve been <em>all in</em><span style="font-style: normal"> since the moment we met. Why?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNzE5MmE3NWQ3YTQwNmRhOTM0NjQ2M2YyOWNiMDI4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNiZGE1ODBmOGVhZjRjZGNhNTM0YTBiYjgwZmI5Mjcw" style="margin-bottom: 0">The girl hummed quietly, thinking about it. Finally, she smiled. “You’re too cute to wear such a serious face all the time. That’s what made me come over in the first place. Something about that cute face and that too serious attitude makes me want to find ways to make you loosen up.”</p>
<p class="cnNjY2Q2MDJjYzRhNzQyMWNhMzRlNDMwZjE0NDJmOThi" style="margin-bottom: 1em">“Ah yes, of course. How could I forget? It’s a law of the universe. <em>Cute is justice</em><span style="font-style: normal">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNzJlOWRjZjRhYTQ1ZjE4OWE2N2I4ODczZWUxZWM4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMyMWVlM2I3MDcyODRmMjE5MTdhMjc1ZWI5ZDcxOWQ5" style="margin-bottom: 0">Obi giggled. “Heh! I like that!” After a moment, her smile dipped a bit and she looked away. “Also, I felt like if I didn’t, you’d be perfectly happy burying yourself in training, studying, and whatever else and only making <em>acquaintances</em><span style="font-style: normal">, never friends. You seem like the kind of person who needs someone to look after them and make sure they don’t focus entirely on work. Which is </span><em>really weird</em><span style="font-style: normal"> for a kid, you know! Everyone else was too busy giggling about stupid things to see it, so I did it myself.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOGY3OTFhNjZjYzQ4ZTA4MjFiMjk1YmVmNjMwNGY2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNmZGE5OTQ4ZGRkMzRkNjFhZTFiMWQxODIzNjBjOGJi" style="margin-bottom: 0">She hadn’t done it to gain anything, or leverage any connection in the future. She had just reached out because I looked <em>too serious</em><span style="font-style: normal"> and </span><em>alone</em><span style="font-style: normal">. Because she felt like it was the right thing to do, and because she genuinely cared. That much was obvious, by the way she felt. Obi didn’t exactly conceal her feelings most of the time and I couldn’t detect a hint of deception or ulterior motive.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjN2YxZDI3NzI3NzQwN2FiYjdhMTczMjRlYTE5YTIy" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNkZDkxY2QyMWYwNzRhYjc5MzlkODNjMjA1M2QxYjhk" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">It left me floored, if I’m being honest. Viktoriya was the closest I had come to a friend in the years since my forced reincarnation, and that relationship was burdened by the distance of rank. I didn’t know what to say, except perhaps, “Thanks.”</p>
<p class="cnM3NzQ3YzdhZTZmMDQzMDE5NDI4NTJkYzcxZGI1OWUy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NzMwOGJkZWQ2NzRhYzk4NjllOGQ0OTYzMDJlZjdm" style="margin-bottom: 0">Chuckling, Obi shifted under the covers and, minding my arm and ribs, carefully wrapped herself around me like a human dakimakura. “You’re even cuter when you’re all embarrassed and don’t know what to say. It kind of makes me want to embarrass you more, just to see that cute face!”</p>
<p class="cnM4YWQxMTVmZjM4YzQ4N2I4OWM1MGRhNmM4ODMyZTEx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM1MGQwZTU5ODMzYzRkNmNhMDM2YjAwNGJjNTlhMzc5" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Isn’t bullying against the Jedi code somewhere? Something, something,<em> bullying is the path to the dark side</em><span style="font-style: normal">,</span>” I grumbled, closing my eyes as Obi giggled.</p>
