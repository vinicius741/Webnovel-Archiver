<p class="cnNmMDgxYmJjMjMwYTQwYWE5MzVmZDViZjFhZjc1OWRm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><strong>Osram Time: 11:30, February 24, 2295</strong></span></p>
<p class="cnNjYmZjNDUzN2RiZDQwMDY4OTc4ZDQwNzYzNGJhZmNi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Antechamber, 888 kilometers beneath Door Kaamos, Vault of Primal Urges, Osram</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMGE4ZWM5NzM3NDQ3YmI5YzFhYTU3MzBlNWE5YzFl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The lift stopped with a metallic shudder that Dilinur felt in her bones. Massive doors, five stories tall, loomed before them. She stepped onto the antechamber's obsidian floor, followed by her soldiers - lines of Bloodtroopers and Amber-Eyes protecting Conjurers and Peons.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMzc4NmRhZjhhZjQ5MGQ4ODgzODg1NzM4OTcyZmNi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Ancient warrior statues lined the towering walls. Each statue stood like a sentinel, carved from the same dark stone as the walls but with hints of deep blue that suggested something beyond normal metal. They wore horned helmets with glowing eye slits, and held strange weapons that seemed half organic, half mechanical. Some stood with arms crossed, looking both regal and threatening.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNjRlYTljMmIyYzQwZDA4MGE4MjQzOWQ2YzZiYTFm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur's gaze followed the murals to the center - a massive scene of cosmic battle. Beyond that, something pulsed. It was a giant crystal, as tall as the doors behind her, jutting from the ground like a piece of frozen sky. It glowed blue, scattering light in complex patterns. The inside seemed alive - shifting and refracting like it contained a storm.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYzdjYTNiNGFiMjQxY2FiNzI3MzVjYzJhOTMzZjlj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur had to look up to see its full height, taking in the jagged structure that narrowed to a sharp point. Cracks ran through it, but instead of looking weak, they seemed to radiate power. A faint hum filled the air, as if the crystal was breathing.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMjFmNzQ4ODM5NjQ2NmNhOWE2M2YxNWI1NDUxNDYy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As she adjusted to the sight, she realized what it was. The Moondust Crystal.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTNhNDc0MWYzZTRkMmM4MmYzNzRlNTRlNGFhMTJk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The projection in our data didn't do it justice," Kaori said, her high voice echoing off the walls. "See those cracks near the bottom? I bet someone was here before and cut away a piece."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDgyODk4MWMxMTQ0ZmM4YTljZDk5YzY2MGQ5MTA0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As they approached, Dilinur felt dread growing in her chest. The guardians she'd read about were waking up.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDdhZTEwYzk1NzRlMDA4MWMyNzIxMGM2YWY2OTUz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Hulking forms began to move in the shadows. At first they looked like part of the walls, but then stone cracked and shifted, revealing massive limbs. Each golem stood nearly three meters tall, with bodies made of gray stone streaked with glowing blue lines.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYWQ5MzEzZjUxYzRlMWRhOTYxZWU0YzY0YTgwZDBm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The light pulsed as they moved, slow and deliberate. Their hands were huge and clawed, scraping the ground. Their heads looked insect-like, with segmented plates and single glowing orbs for eyes. Each step made the ground shake.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMzEzNzEwODU0MTRmNTNhMjY0YTM0OWMzNjdjNmRj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Stone Guardians, Prefect," one of the Conjurers said. "The data mentioned they're - extremely protective."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOWMwZTllNTNmNDRiZmRiMmQ0YzA5YTYwODIxN2Zh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Disturb not the sanctity of what lies within," boomed a deep voice from the golem facing her. The words resonated in her bones rather than her ears. Its eye glowed as it spoke. "For the Moondust Crystal is not meant for configuration by mere Earth-dwellers."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYTFhY2I2OGMwMjQyOWJhYmM1OTU5NzM5NGQ4OWUy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Energy rippled from the Crystal. Dilinur noticed how the light intensified when Joon-Seok moved closer, the cracked surface rippling with possibilities.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NmM4NjA1ZGY3MTQwYzViN2VkMTA2ZGNiM2NiYTUw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She gripped her Psi-Fan tightly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ODQ0YmIwNzgxYjRlMDU4M2QwMTkxYjEyMDBjYWI1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Bloodtroopers! Advance!" Dilinur commanded. Her troops surged forward, breaking formation. Their boots pounded the ground, leaving dust clouds behind. Their Thermal Battleaxes gleamed in the crystal's light.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OGUxNmRhMDAwNTQzZWI4NzBlZWYzZWMyZDE3M2Q0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Their strikes landed hard, but the ancient guardians didn't budge. Their rocky bodies seemed immune to the attacks. Sparks flew where metal hit stone, showing how futile the Imperial Legion's efforts were.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNzU4ZjkzNzZlYjQxNzVhOWMyZWNhMmQzNWIyN2Vk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Concentrate on the joints!" Dilinur shouted over the noise of battle. But her words were lost in the chaos; the Bloodtroopers continued their useless attacks against the Stone Guardians.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMmM5Nzk3OTk5YjQ5ZmM5MDVkNTE2YjZjMzE1NzQ0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A Guardian swept its massive arm in a wide arc. Troopers went flying, crumpling under its power. With each effortless move, the ancient giants decimated her forces, sending soldiers sprawling across the floor with dented and broken armor.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYWE5NjIwYmEzOTRhNThhODdmYjI5NWJkYmM1ZTlj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Numbers mean nothing here," Joon-Seok said quietly, almost to himself. He rested his hand on his Psytum Sword. "But we will not relent."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYjY4NWIwY2E0ODRkMmY4NWNiNmMwZGY3NzE5Nzc3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"No. We try another strategy," Dilinur looked at the eleven archers behind her, their black armor accented with red.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNTQxNTNjZmU3MDRlMWJiMjQwMWJlZDBlMjQzZmM3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The archers held their Kinetic Crossbows steady. Their dark hair was tightly braided, their faces focused and determined. The crystal's light reflected off their intricate armor, casting sharp shadows.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMTkwZWRhNjFhNjQzOTdhYTgxZTk1OTk4MmQ3ZmE3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Amber-Eyes, to formation!" she called, raising her folded Psi Fan. "On my count - fire in sync!"</span></p><span class="cjk2YTRmMjAwYTA0MzRiZGZhZjVjMGMxNmJjNTUwNmE5"><br/>Reading on this site? This novel is published elsewhere. Support the author by seeking out the original.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNlMjhhZmFhNjZlZTRjYWE5MzdhYmM4OWM1NDQwZmI1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Chā!" The Amber-Eyes responded in unison as they took position precisely. They waited for her signal.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZmMwZDg0YjNkMzRkM2M4ZGZjZWQ1Y2I1M2UwNmY5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Beside her, Joon-Seok nodded in approval.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDkxMDUzNjA1OTRkZjViZDBkMDA1ZTg1MjMwZTVj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Three... two... one... release!" Dilinur commanded, pointing her Psi Fan forward.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYmI2ZmI3OGYwMDRlOWU5NTRjNzZhYWM5NjQ0ODQ3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A volley of bolts flew through the air, trailing kinetic energy. They struck with deadly accuracy, piercing the Stone Guardians' rocky bodies. One of the five giants stumbled, cracks spreading across it before it crumbled into rubble.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNzg2ZGFlNDU4NjQ5ODdhYTQyYmJkZDdlNWE2MmM0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A wave of triumph passed through the ranks. Dilinur turned to Joon-Seok with a fierce grin.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYmVmNTczNWQ1MTQwZWJhYTQ0NDgxNDY3NGNkMjhm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Reload! Ready your bolts!" she called, raising her hand. The sound of crossbows reloading echoed through the cavern.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMDNhYzJiY2ZlNjQ0YTliN2VhNDE0Nzg5MTQyYmE5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Chā!" The archers announced as they finished reloading together.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZGVlNTRmYjBlZDQ1ZWY5Mjg1N2E0OGI1ZTNiMWM3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Two - one - release!" Dilinur gestured with her fan.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMWY3ZDRmZDM5MDQ2OGE4YzJjYzlkNTBiYWY5ZmM4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Another wave of bolts hit the remaining Guardians. Two more shattered and fell.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYTg3OWFlZGU3NDQ2ZDRiOGYyM2ZlMmU3ZDU4OTkx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Only two remain! Reload!" Dilinur's voice rang with pride and excitement.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZWQ3NDgyNjQzYjQzZjM4ZDNjMmY5OGJhZTE2ODgx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The cavern shook as the two remaining Guardians moved closer together, casting long shadows.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMTQxZGM4NzBlNTRmYThiNzk5YTM4ZmY2NzE4Mjdj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">They began to chant in an ancient language, their deep voices filling the chamber.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhM2EzYzQ3NGIzZjRmODA5OGIxYzhjMmFkZGM2NGNk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Kavacham!" they intoned.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDVhZDlmNDE5MTQ5NjViODNkZmYzMmUxOWNjMWUw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur's heart raced as she watched. Their words formed a shimmering barrier around them, pulsing with energy.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMmY5YzY0OGZjODQ4YWJhMTNiZDE3MTk5N2UyZGE1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Two - one - release!" she commanded again.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzdmNDgxZmI5MjQ0ZmM5NWQ2N2RkMzI5ZWU5M2I3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">But when the archers fired, their arrows bounced off the barrier and flew back toward them. Bolts struck her own troops, piercing through armor and helmets.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZGRjYjVjMTVmYTQ0MGRiNzdjZmYyYmFlZmIzYzc3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Velum Purpureum!" Joon-Seok reacted quickly. His hand rose as he whispered the spell. Red energy gathered at his fingertips, forming a bubble around himself and Dilinur just as a bolt nearly hit them.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDY1ODZjNmJhYTRmZDViYjdjYjk0YjcyMmEwODJh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Chaos erupted as three archers fell behind them. Dilinur caught her breath.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDE2MWQ0MmJkZTQ5OWE5ODg5NTg1NmI5YTQ3MTdj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Stay close," Joon-Seok said calmly despite the chaos. His arm wrapped around her for balance, pulling her against him. Her pulse quickened at the sudden closeness.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYmExYmNkZDVhODRlN2U4ZjBjZTQ1MTFkMjVmMGY1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She leaned into his chest, their robes brushing together. In the middle of chaos, they found a moment of calm.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYTEzZWNlZWIxMjQzNzE4ZTRhMGI4MDFhODliZWIy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Thank you," she whispered, her cheeks warm not from battle but from their contact.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMDZlYjY2MDE3NjQ3MmI4ZjQ0YmI5Y2YxZWQwYTBi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Kaori. Is your Phoenix Submachine Gun ready?" Joon-Seok asked, his voice steady despite maintaining the shield.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MGE4ODkyZmYzODQzMzFhYmUzYTBlOWZmNDU0NTAx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur recognized the term. The Imperium's variant of compact machine gun was one of the weapons that their society had inherited from the old world. Only a few individuals knew how to operate it while tolerating the recoil.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOTQ4M2M2ZDZlNTQ3NGZiMmMxMzMxN2UyYTcxZjJm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Always!" Kaori replied, drawing her weapon.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YmY4ZmUwZGIxMDQxYTQ5NzU3YTEwMmJiYmMzNzg2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Her custom-made Phoenix SMG gleamed under the red light - a beautiful weapon with rich red lacquer and intricate patterns on the stock and barrel. In the eyes of the uneducated, it could at times be mistaken as an assault rifle. She loaded a magazine with a sharp click.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNmYwZTEzNGFhMTQ1NzA4MTUyMTY3NzU3OWUwM2Qy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Fall back! We will handle the rest," Joon-Seok ordered the remaining Amber-Eyes. They retreated toward the cavern entrance.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MWFkYTU3OGRhMDQ3OWFiZjYzNGY0ZTc4YTcwNjI0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The two Stone Guardians stood tall, casting long shadows across the chamber.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMTc1MTU0ZDYyZDQxYjI4ZDU3YTliYTY2ZjMzYjc5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Joon-Seok looked at Dilinur intensely. "Dinu, your Tarim Aytün."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNThiNzM2ZWRiOTQ2NDk4MTAwYjRiODI3MGI0MTM4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yes," Dilinur's cheeks flushed. She nodded and moved from his embrace, holding her weapon at chest height.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDRjNDZjODcwZDRiNmRiMmY1YTBiN2ZiY2M2Nzg0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">With a flourish, she unfolded her Psi Fan. Its silver surface glittered as red psychic energy flowed from it, rippling through the cavern.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYmMzOGYzYTE2YTQ1YmY4ZTgyMTFiMmQ1YmY3YmVi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">They stepped away from each other, ready to fight.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MWFjYjFhYzA5ODRlZGU5YjY3MDliNmUxOGYxYzc1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur's heart pounded as the Stone Guardians advanced.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDFlNzk1OTU5ZDQyOGZhZDI2OGUwYjRkNGYyYWNm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Rakta Phiniks, hanatu!" Energy swirled around her as she moved her Psi-Fan. With a flick of her wrist, a phoenix-shaped energy wave formed and flew toward the Guardians.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNWZhMTBjZGM2ODQ3ZDA4YzdhNTY5Y2M0MzllNmUy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Beside her, Joon-Seok ignited his Psytum Sword, slicing through the air. Each swing broke the Guardians' gray limbs. Where their attacks crossed, the Crystal pulsed differently, as if trying to combine their powers.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMTQ4YmUwNzc0YjQ2Nzk4NTMyMjcyMTRkYTYzNWQ0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Kaori laughed wildly as she fired her SMG, chipping away at the rocky armor. Her grin was fierce, her amber eyes bright with battle-lust.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNzVjZDQzMWM0NzRmNTVhOGY4NTAzODE4ZmRkYmMz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As Dilinur fought, she felt the distance between herself and Joon-Seok. Their movements were in sync but separate, allies by necessity but divided.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNGNhZWFkODIwYTQ1MDBiZjc4MTVhNzVjZDg0OGZi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Rakta Unmāda!" she shouted over the noise, casting an enhancement spell on Joon-Seok.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNWY1NGQyNTg5ZTRmNjhhN2JjMjYwODRlYWM1NTAx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"My power knows no equal," he said as ruby energy surrounded him, strengthening his attacks.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MmM4YjFjOWI5MTQ3MmE4NDNhMDM2YTYwYjNlNzZj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Agni Śūla Hana!" she chanted, sending a scythe-shaped flame of psionic energy at the last Guardian, shattering it.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZjUyMDc3MDg3ODRlOWU5NzZkYjVhNmM5MmE0NWRm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Joon-Seok's jaw tightened, briefly looking contrite. "My apologies, Dinu," he said sincerely, though his eyes remained intense as he moved closer. "My attitude at Door Kaamos was...inappropriate."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOTkxNWVkZTU2NjQ2OGQ5NGY1NDk5MzgxMzAzY2Vi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The promise hung between them amid the battle.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MWFiMzYxYjQwNzQ1YTA5NmYyNDZlZTJjMTA5MmFk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Standing shoulder to shoulder, Dilinur muttered, "It's alright, Joon-Seok. I'm just glad to be by your side."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjNmYWUwZGM5NzQ3ZTlhNGEyNTI3OTU4ZGI5ZDdm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As the last guardian crumbled, Dilinur noticed the Crystal's light changing. Its steady pulse now seemed more complex.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MjhlOGI3MDFjNzQ1OTRhMjg5YzQ0ZjIwYTYwZjk2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The surviving Amber-Eyes, Bloodtroopers and Conjurers emerged from the shadows, their black-and-red armor dulled by the fight. They moved purposefully back into formation.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OTg5ZTYxZWNhNjRmZDU4MGQ2Y2M5YWVhMmI3NmJl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Secure the perimeter," Dilinur ordered. The archers and soldiers nodded and moved into position.</span></p>
