<p class="cnM4OWUxY2MxNzYwMDQ0ZWM4ODY3MGZhZWNmOWQzMzM1"><span style="font-weight: 400">With Futaba’s words ringing in my head, I tried to play my favorite high-octane shooter to try and curb those thoughts. Still, they kept crawling back over and over.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YzM0YjM5YzY5NjQ4MjY5NDFjOThlNjBkM2RlYTA0"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s not like I’m looking at the situation the wrong way. What Ayumi wants to do is reckless. She’s messing with something we don’t understand. It’s dangerous no matter how the situation develops. But the way my mom and Futaba explained the situation made it seem like it was my fault. That, despite knowing Ayumi for so long, I didn’t understand her at all.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNlNWViNWJhYWIyNjRmZWY5NTljODBiMmYzZGM3YzBh"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Wait, could it be…? Has Ayumi always had a firm grasp on reality? If... if that’s the case… she must have known that angels existed all along. And I just bet that that relates to the reason she’s so obsessed about them.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnM4ZGUwNDIwZmI2YjQ2NDE4MDRjNTYzNDUwMTI2YmZh"><em><span style="font-weight: 400"> She must know some crucial information she’s never shared with me. She’s not “riding the fantasy” of angels and the supernatural. No, she knew perfectly well from the very beginning that angels exist.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnM2YjFiNGY1NWMzYzQ5OWQ4ZDQ3MThhOTI5YzE5MjJl"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">And that’s what I didn’t get.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNiM2QyYmVkZjUzNzQ2ODFiNTJlZjU0MTFmMGEyMWNi"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Why, Ayumi? Why didn’t you trust me with this? How am I supposed to trust you when you don’t trust me back?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnMyNzFhYWUyM2QyOTRmOGViNTBmMWVhZGIzNjhmZjVh"><span style="font-weight: 400">These ideas kept running in circles in my brain for hours. Who was at fault? Who should give in in this battle? Heck, were either of us even wrong at all? And what “lie” is she living?</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOTZhYjM1YmQyZTRkMzA5YzRjMTQ0NDA1Njg0Njg5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, I decided to stop mulling about it and take action. I was going to get to the bottom of this mystery called “Ayumi”, once and for all.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMDhlM2M0YWNkYjRiYWViMjBmNmNlN2VmYTU1ZGM0"> </p>
<p class="cnM1MzcwMmZiMjNlNTRlZjU5Yzg2ODFkYmI4ZWI3YmNm"><span style="font-weight: 400">* * *</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOGIyMWQ0NjA1MzQzYTQ4Y2NmNDFmNDdhMjM4Nzli"> </p>
<p class="cnM4ZmIxMThhMjcyZDQ2NGViODYxZjJlM2E2OTkyZTM5"><span style="font-weight: 400">After a night of little sleep, I decided to return to school. I also texted Ayumi in the morning and asked her to wait for me as soon as classes ended that day to make sure she wouldn’t disappear.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMTE5MjJkMTYzMDQ4ZTI4NjFhZWI3YzBiNmM1Mzhj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Since most people thought I had a cold, my return to class was met with absolute indifference. Futaba and Daichi did come to talk to me to make sure I was fine, but that was it.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4M2RmNTAyNjFiMzRhNTA5NjJmNzQxZDg5MjE1NmQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">After an anxious day, I left the classroom before Ayumi did and waited by the school entrance for a few minutes. She showed up not long after, smiling and laughing with her friends. As soon as she saw me, she excused herself from them and went past me with a sour expression that struck me as purposely forced.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMjM3NGM4YzNmMzQ3MmVhMGM1ZWFjOGI2MDVjZWJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">It didn’t feel weird being with her after so long; what felt weird was the fact that she was quiet. The awkwardness prevented me from saying anything concrete too. After a few minutes of silent walking, I knew this tense situation was reaching a tipping point. Ayumi was walking ahead of me, but I could feel her rising irritation in her gait.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZWU0NmUwODdiYzQwNGI4ODE1MmJmOGQ4NzgyZjQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So? What did you want to talk about?” She asked with a rough tone.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZmJiZWM3M2FlYzQ2YzBhYzE0MzcxNDcyNDkxZGNk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I…” Despite my resolve, my words got stuck in my throat.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YjIxMjhiMTkwNzQwYmViYjYwNGQ3NmYxMmIzNzA3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What, are you chickening out of admitting you were wrong?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZmE4MWEwMDI3ZDRjNWVhMGY2ZTYyNzcyMjYxODlm"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Jeez, this girl has an unparalleled way of pushing my buttons.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNlMzJhMGJlY2I2NDRhYTNiMjlhMDUxZDY3YzRiNDk5"><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a deep breath to calm myself down.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0N2RlNGI4ZjU2NjQzMmZhZjBjZWMwYmZlMzc3NzQw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I still don’t think I’m wrong at all.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZDZkN2JkMzA0YjQyODE4YzQ0YjJmMDlkNTQ0MTAy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing this, Ayumi turned around and revealed her definitely-for-real-this-time sour frown.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNjRkYTVkMWVjYzQwOWE5Nzk3ZmJlY2RhMDhkZDY2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then why did you want to meet with me? If you don’t have anything to say, I’m going on ahead. I've got a lot to do and time’s not on my side.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YWIyMWY0YjFlNDQwNWRiMWM4MjgwYmRlYWVlZGZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">She began trotting away, but before she could get too far, I grabbed her arm.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMTcxNjZlOTYwNjRmODI5NTA5N2E0ZDMzMzZjOWI5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait a second. I haven’t said everything yet.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ODljOTkxZTM2NDQ2MTFiZTAzYjY2NjFmNGY2NDdi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ayumi, forced to stop, turned back to me with narrowed eyes that told me to go somewhere else.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNDJhNjU1MDdjZTQ2MjdhZDBhMmU5ODQxNDhlM2Q5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“At least hear me out.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxY2ZjNzk3YjlmNTQxNGJiZWJmODE3ZjUwYmM1YmZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">She relaxed her expression a bit, as if saying I could go on.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNmVmYzg5YjJlZTRkOGU4YzliYjVjMTZjOTM0NjY0"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">This is it. I can’t fail now.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNhZjNiMjlmZjI3NzRjNDFhMDhjOTRhMmQwZWQwNjIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a deep breath. The chilly air entering my lungs helped clear my head somewhat.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZmI3MmI5NjRmNjQyYTA5YWE1MjU2MTI2OGYxMWM1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Despite disagreeing with you, I’ve decided to trust you. I trust that you have a good reason to be doing something so rash. That was where I was wrong. I’ve been wrong for a long time. So for that, I apologize. I’m sorry, Ayumi.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNzhhNDdmZDkwZDQxZTlhNGI1N2M3MWE3ZTM0YTRl"><span style="font-weight: 400">I gave a deep bow, half for honestly apologizing and the other half to avoid looking at her face.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZTQwMjkwMTA3NDQwODQ5N2NjNDRhZDNlZTNkYjFi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, silence.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNGQwZDY4MmQwNjQ0YTk5N2YzM2MzMjQzNmVhYTcw"><span style="font-weight: 400">On top of those heartfelt words, the silence that befell upon us made my body feel like it was going to collapse at any moment.</span></p><span class="cmU1ZGU2MDQ0YmRhZDQ5ZWU5NGI0NGNmOWIwODBkYjEz"><br/>Stolen from Royal Road, this story should be reported if encountered on Amazon.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM5NDM3Yjc3ZTM1ZjRiNGFhMGU0NjQyMGNjNzE3OGI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">When I raised my head, Ayumi lowered hers, hiding her eyes behind her messy bangs.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZjlmOGUxZmM3NzQ2YTFiNzBjY2E5ZGUzYjYyMmQ4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really… you always have a way to come around at the end of the day. Do you know how long I’ve been waiting to hear that?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Zjg5Y2I2MWQxZjRiMDJiZTc1YmE3Njk5YWRjZGFl"><span style="font-weight: 400">I rattled my brain, trying to find anything I could use to answer her words. But before I could, she raised her head.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmM2ViNWFiOTE1NjQzY2Q4ZmM1NzdmMWNlZmJlMzJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ayumi’s expression was so unexpected I couldn’t respond even if I had something prepared.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NWY0MGFmZTA0NTQ1N2NiNjRmY2RkYTUxYzM2MWQx"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Is she… blushing?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnMzNjg4ZTM5NzkzNjRjNGQ4ODExZTA5YzU0NDUxNTE0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her emerald eyes were shining, on the verge of tears. A light-pink tint was painted on her cheeks. No matter who it was, at that moment, they would have said she was ridiculously cute.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTVhNWNjNTNiZTRkYjNhZjk2NTlkMGY3YmRiNTY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you, Takkun,” she said with a childish, innocent smile. “Thank you for finally understanding.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MGRlMWQ4NzhjNzQ3NjdiYzBjNjc2Mzc1MDlmZjZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">I was speechless. Despite her blissful look, a deep, gnawing darkness made me feel sick to my core.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMWI2ZTFjNmVhODRlYmZiZWUzZWRiNGQwY2ZiM2Ni"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Who knew such simple words could make her so happy? Where have I made a wrong turn in my life to not notice something so simple?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnMwN2Q2MmI5NmRlMjQ0NzU5ZjI1ZTQ5MzVhYTM1MDI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">If I had known that ephemeral expression would disappear along with her next words, I would have burned it into my mind for all eternity.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Yjk5Nzk0OTZiODQwZWI5YmU4YWQ5NDU3NTlmMTQ0"><span style="font-weight: 400">But this was Ayumi. Her mood changed faster than the weather during the typhoon season. She rubbed her eyes with her oversized sleeves and forced herself to speak normally.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZmEwYTA5ZDU1ZDRjMDA5MjFkMDQ2NjI1MjY1NTkw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, now that that’s over with, you won’t mind helping me get to the bottom of this, right?” she said, returning to her usual light-hearted smile.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNDU2ZjhkZGJmNDQ0NzI5YTA1YmVlNzcxYTBkMDg3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I… guess,” I said with self-doubt.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZjhkMDE2MTVmZjQ4ZjY5NzU5NzBkZWUxZjFkNzIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was still something else on my mind.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZDUwMjRkMjA5OTQzNTk4YjBiNDRmNGNiMmE5NTZk"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">If this was the answer, then…</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNlNDEzMTkyMzAzZjQwYWQ4NmY3ODM3MTU4MGE5NDAw"><span style="font-weight: 400">I decided to take a gamble. “But you have to promise me something first.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MjIzZThiY2ZmZjQ5ODdiZTVjOGQ1ZWMyMTNiNmUz"><span style="font-weight: 400">This time, she was the one caught off-guard. “Huh?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMTFjMTk2YzEyNTQ5ZDlhYjg5Zjg1YmY5YzlmY2Q0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t know what it is, but… whatever it is you’re hiding, the reason why you’re trying so hard to meet an angel, what this ‘lie’ you mentioned before is—I want you to tell me.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OTQyMzUyYWFmMzQ0NWZhMTYzMTY5YzYyY2RiYjEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ayumi’s eyes opened so wide that I thought they might pop out of their sockets.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZTcyMDQ1MTliNzQxNDNhYmYzYWVlZTNhZGI5ZWQ4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ve decided to trust you on this, so… I hope you can trust me back. Otherwise, I won’t help you.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTg1N2UxZGZmYzQ3N2FiM2IxZTlmZjM2ZDhmZmZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl stared at me for what seemed like minutes with an inscrutable expression.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NTI0OGViOTNhNDQ5YmM4MDM4ZDAyMjZiYmFmNjE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, she opened her mouth.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNzkzMjEyY2ViYjQ3MjNhY2VlYjllOGNhMDAwOTI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright. When this is all over, I’ll tell you.” Then, she extended her right pinky finger. “Pinky promise?” she asked with a cutesy voice while staring at the ground.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOGMyMzk0M2U1MDRiMDc5NDZmNDQ4NjEwNjc2MTA5"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Really, you’re such a child.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnMzMzAwZjNjMDhlZjQ1ODg5NzNmZGYwNzAxODA0Nzlk"><span style="font-weight: 400">The pinky embrace didn’t last even a second. Ayumi, maybe feeling embarrassed by this childish ritual, returned to her brisk pace in the direction of the bus stop.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NGMxZjhlMzZiYzQ0NzA5OTBmOTliNjEwMWFmNzFl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Since you’ve promised to help me, I guess I have no choice but to catch you up to speed,” she said with her usual impish tone. “That said, nothing much has changed. I’m trying to find information about Shiina, but my investigations have been kind of fruitless.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NDVjNWY4NDRmNTRiYzg5YmEzNzhiNGVjOWU3OGFl"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Even you, the queen of poking around, are stumped? </span></em></p>
<p class="cnNkZDE1MGM5MDlkZjQxZGI4ZjE0ZDAzMTkzZWM3NjBj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No one I talked to has spotted her recently or knows where she might live. So lately, I’ve been making rounds around the shopping street, but no luck so far. It’s like she’s some sort of ghost.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ODM5MzcwYjRlZTQ0MTk5NDY5NTAyODk3NmM1NWNm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You think she knows we’re onto her?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyY2U2YTEzYjQ2NzQyYjlhMWZmZTU4NDJkOTBlZGNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nuh-uh, not likely. If they knew anything, we wouldn’t be having this conversation right now. The only thing we know about her in the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">real</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> world is that she goes to the bookstore. I’ve been staking out the place, but no luck so far.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYWI0MjJiYTNhNzRhMWZiZTlhNWE2M2IxMTk0MDI5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I haven’t been going to work either, so I can’t say if she went there or not.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNGM2MDBjZWZiNTRiMzRhNmFhNDExOGVlNTcwODg5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, that’s a bummer. I was hoping for an easy breakthrough, but it seems that won’t happen anytime soon.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTBmZGIyZWJlNDQwOWJhYTlkMjExMDU0YWJlM2Jh"><span style="font-weight: 400">With a swift motion, Ayumi turned back around to face me. “However! With you on board, we can change tactics,” she said as she wiggled her finger in my direction.</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m having you stay put at the bookstore. Preferably every afternoon. It’s our only point of contact with her, after all.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYmJmZmQ4N2E5ZDQxYmZhY2ViZGI4YmViZjZhODky"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...What?” I questioned with a furrowed brow.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMDMxNTFjZDQxNjRkYzFiZjgzZjdhMDg1ZWZmOWE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The more you’re there, the better the chances of meeting her. If she does show up, try to extract as much information as you can from her.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMjc0MTFjZWZkMjQzNjc5ZjRjYmRhZGI1YWZmMWQx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, wait a sec.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMTU0ZDcxMzk5MzRjNDk4ZTI3NzM2YzRiODYwMTE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? You can ask the owners to let you work more days. Say you need the extra money or something.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MTg1OTUwNmU1NzQxMDhiYjE1MzcwZTczMzU5ZDU2"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">What about my free time? Or my study time? Any concern for that at all?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNlNTNlM2Y4NjkwMDRmZmRhZDZiMmIyMTIxNWE5NWVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You want me to get information out of her? She’ll suspect me if I do that,” I tried to explain.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYTliMzUxMjdmZjQ1MjlhZWVkZmNjODU5ZGJlMGVk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She won’t. Remember, if she’s here in the human world, it means she has some intention of blending in. Since we’re in a rush, act like you’re hitting on her or something. That won’t look </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">too</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> out of place.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMGViMjgyZmE0MzRhZTlhMjVkY2VmM2JlMmQwMmI3"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">What the heck is with that suggestion?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnMyNWU0ZWNjM2Q3YzQ3MDhhNzc4OGEzNmJhMWQxZDNm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Despite being a closet nerd you don’t look half bad, so she might just take the bait.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYTBhODA0MWRkZTQzM2FiYjAwZGZiM2RiMGYzMWU1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, no way. That’s impossible.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Nzc2MmZkNDgyMTQ1M2ZiM2FmOTg0ZGFkMmI2YmE3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aren’t you always playing those du— I mean, interesting dating sims? Surely that helps a bit, no?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NTUxZmE5Yzc4NzQzNGQ5YWM5YzExYzRjMjhhMzJm"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">You were about to say “dumb,” weren’t you? Also, I’m not </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">always</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400"> playing them, come on. Okay, maybe I play them quite often, but the point stands.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnM5MWIxNjYxMGJlNzQwZDI4ZWM0ZGU3NDExY2NmNTE3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No way. I’m not Daichi. Dating sims are one thing, real life is a completely different beast.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZDk2OTQxMmFhZjQ0MTlhYTgxYWVlZTllYTFhNDE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ayumi sighed. “Fine. Just do your best. You aren’t actually hitting on her, so you can fail miserably as long as you still get the information.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlODdhYTQwYjE2ZjQwM2M4NjIxYmY0OTc3NmNlOTA4"><span style="font-weight: 400">I elected to ignore her assumption for many reasons, and asked a very pertinent question. “What will you do in the meanwhile?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmM2NiYTkxODJlZjRlNzZiZDg2OTJiMjE4ZTIwNzBm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll be looking around for her too, of course. You do the passive search, I’ll do the active. It’s the best of both worlds. You should be glad I’m not forcing you to be on the lookout in this weather. Do we have a deal?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZjY1MGE5NTEyYzQ3MTk4NmZkNTA2ZDRkYTNmNWM3"><span style="font-weight: 400">With her eyes shining like that, I had a hard time saying no. Not like I was planning to reject her anyway.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNzU3ZDNhMTZlMzRmOGFiOTRkYTVkM2Y3YWE4Mzc2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fine, but I don’t know how many additional hours the owners will give me.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOGEwMzc2Yjc5ZDQwYjRiMzExYTgxZjkxMGQzMzY3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“As long as you can do it for a few days, it would be fantastic.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYzI2OTZlZDdjMzQ0MDQ4YWFiM2Y1MDlmZWFlYTVj"><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, in just a few minutes, Ayumi and I went from being on bad terms to me getting, yet again, involved in her crazy plans. I dreaded the prospect of working every day for an undetermined amount of time. But the darkness consuming me over the past week had vanished.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZTE1NTJhNjJiNjQ2Mzk4MWYwZjI3NTI1NTIwNDAx"><span style="font-weight: 400">This craziness felt right.</span></p>
