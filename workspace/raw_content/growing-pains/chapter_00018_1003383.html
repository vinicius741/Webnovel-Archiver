<p class="cnM1ZWFjNjNhYTVmYTQ3ODNiMDNjMTk1Nzc0Y2FlN2I2">Sure, there had been alien invasions in the past. But all of those had been relatively short affairs that ended quickly.</p>

<p class="cnMwYTQ4ZTI1M2JkNTQ0MWQ5NWE3OWY1Y2E3NTA3NjM0">The Imperium had infiltrated and sabotaged Earth for years before launching their main attack and it had taken a collective effort of several of the greatest heroes the world had seen working together in a way not seen since WWII to push them back.</p>

<p class="cnM1MDhkZTdmY2JiYzQzMDk4Yzg2MDU4MzI1YTY1ZDM2">A man spoke on a podium while several brightly costumed figures stood behind him. To many this was the first time that they had seen several heroes standing together without some major crisis getting in the way. That proved attractive enough that the normally dull U.N. press conference was drawing in record numbers with the public across the world.</p>
<p class="cnNlM2M1NjE1N2FiNzQxYjI5MWY1OWJlOWQzZDljM2M3"> </p>
<p class="cnMwNTJlOWRlYjVlMTQ1Mzg5MTc5Y2Y4NzgyNDQ4ZDFi">"...and when we needed them most, the heroes behind me and many more that could not be here today stepped forward to protect our world. We cannot thank them enough, but today I am proud to offer these heroes a medal of valor for their actions and a symbolic one for each and every person that stood against the Imperium." The man stepped back and after a brief award ceremony, Superman stepped forward.</p>

"A few weeks ago, we faced a threat unlike one we had ever encountered. A hostile force that had not only set their sights on conquering our planet but draining it dry of everything it could offer. A threat that did not come boldly from the stars, but one that hid among us and waited until they were too widespread for one hero to deal with.</p>

<p class="cnMzMWUyYjVkYjdhYTRjYzZiYzdmZGIwZDE4Y2UwMGM1">"There will be some things that are too big for one person, one hero…even me, to handle. When those times come we will look to each other for help, and when that isn't enough…you can look to us," Superman turned slightly and held out a hand to the heroes standing with him. Wonder Woman, Batman, Green Lantern, The Flash, Hawkwoman, and Martian Manhunter all stood tall and proud. "For times when one hero isn't enough, more will come. Members of the United Nations, it is my great pleasure to announce the formation of the Justice League."</p>
