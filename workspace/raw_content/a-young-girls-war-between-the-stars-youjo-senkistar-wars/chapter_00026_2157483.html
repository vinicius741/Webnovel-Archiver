<p class="cnNiNzYyZGI2NjZlZTQwNjZiODUyZmZiZjk4YjgxMjJi" style="margin-bottom: 0">“That’s a lot of droids,” Jango mused, studying the army arrayed before us, set in position to defend Ramil’s home. Or at least, the home of someone working with Ramil, who he had confiscated the home from after they died under mysterious circumstances.</p>

<p class="cnNjZGE0ODQ1ZGMxYjQ0MDRhYWY5MDY4Yzc4NTNjNmY1" style="margin-bottom: 0">“I count just over five thousand,” I nodded. They were divided into easy to count battalion sized formations of one thousand each, further sub-divided into two hundred unit companies, all lined up in neat little square and rectangular blocks. “Are we ready?”</p>

<p class="cnNiZmMxZTg0ZjRlNzRjMDA4ODgzNTEzYzA5NjgxNzVm" style="margin-bottom: 0">Master Dyas glanced over at me from the side. Sending me a grin, his feelings radiating amusement and a bit of exasperation, he asked, “I suppose there’s no point to asking if you’re sure you want to go?”</p>

<p class="cnMwMGYxOWRmMDUzMjQ0MzViOGVkMTVhYjk1YzdlMzEy" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Then I’ll make sure the rebels make enough noise to keep them from looking up,” the Jedi chuckled, moving back away from the ledge we were laying on and making his way down the other side of the mountain, to the waiting rebel army below—all that Jenza had been able to muster for this final confrontation.</p>
<p class="cnMwNjQwNjk1Y2NiNTQ0OThhMDlhYWIzMmQyZmY1OWU0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMwNjkxNWUxMmY3NjQwM2JiMGFlOWMwMDJiYWY4YTk3" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Let’s get into position for the jump,” Jango instructed, and I followed him back, then a bit further up the mountain on the opposite side, to where our group of eight other Mandos equipped with jetpacks was waiting. I took a moment to strap mine on, before sitting down to wait for the signal, checking over my weapons in the meantime as the rest of the group made their own final ready checks. Unlike the others, my jetpack had been modified since I’d gotten it—removing the missile and adding a fuel tank in its place, giving me much more range than their own jetpacks. Not that it would matter for this mission.</p>

<p class="cnNiYTc0Mzg0ZWRiMjQxZThhZGU1NWI1YjlhNjU1ZGYw" style="margin-bottom: 0">“We should get her a helmet,” one of the Mandos spoke up—a darkly tan woman I believed was named Sheena or something along those lines. I only recognized her because she had been in Jango’s group since this mission started and I’d caught them sneaking off for recreation when they thought no one was looking a time or two.</p>

<p class="cnM0NzZmY2Q5YTNlOTQyOWNhYjBiYTY5N2U2OTcxNjkz" style="margin-bottom: 0">The woman’s sentiment was echoed by the others and I shook my head. “No point. Once this is over, we’re going back to Coruscant. I won’t be able to bring it to get it resized and I’ll outgrow it in a year, two at most. I’d rather wait and get one commissioned when I finish out most of my growth.”</p>

<p class="cnMyMmIyNjBkZDUwNTQ4MDU4MzdlMTQxM2IzNmYwMmYx" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Tradition. Yes, I am aware. I have enough armor to count, according to Jaster,” I pointed out, tapping my chest hard enough to make the beskar under my robe top thump. “It will have to be good enough for now.”</p>

<p class="cnNkY2QzZDJlZWY4YTQwNjdhZWFkMWRkNGFiMjgzYTkw" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Come on commander, don’t you have an opinion?” one of them asked Jango.</p>

<p class="cnNhOGMwNDBjZDY2NjRhYmM5MmJhNTVlZGExY2E5ZmMz" style="margin-bottom: 0">I turned an amused look on Jango. “Yes, Jango. Please share your opinion.”</p>

<p class="cnMyZjk4YzIwODI4NDQ0OTJiOWM0ZTM0MGYxOGM2OGIw" style="margin-bottom: 0">The man in question refused to look up from where he was checking his wrist-mounted flamethrower—for the third time since this conversation began, by my count. “If the girl who can smack my own blaster bolts back at me thinks she’s fine without a helmet for now, I’ll take her word on it.”</p>
<p class="cnM4NTExNWJhMDljMjQ2Njk4YjRkZmRiMjUxZGUwMGE4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNkZjUxNWVhODdmMjQ4YWI5NGE3ZWYxY2E5MGI3Njg5" style="margin-bottom: 0">The banter continued, with them now mocking Jango for being ‘afraid of a little girl.’ I smiled, mostly tuning it out as I focused and centered myself, preparing myself mentally for the mission ahead.</p>
<p class="cnMxMzdkNmRmNmIyYjQ5ZDE5Mjg0YmFhMjZhMzRkYThj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM5MWUyNjgyZThlNjQ0ZjBiMjUyZmQ5YjAxZDgwM2Yz" style="margin-bottom: 0">The plan was simple, really. After capturing and interrogating the Abyssin leading the last of their mercenary forces, I had sent in a request under his name to meet with Ramil to discuss a plan ‘the commander’ had for taking out the Jedi and rebel forces on Serenno in one fell swoop. He had approved the meeting and given us the location and a time.</p>
<p class="cnNjMTNmZjgwNGU1NzQ2MDM4YzdhOTA3NDhjYmU3ZWUw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNjMTlhZDc0YjU1ZjQ0NmU4ZmI2YzRlZmExNjY0OTAx" style="margin-bottom: 0">Then, I had sent a secret order using the commander’s credentials ordering the remaining Abyssin forces to leave the planet if it looked like the rebel forces were going to make a push against Ramil—they were to cut their losses and run. The reasoning being, they couldn’t spend their credits if they were dead and Ramil had already fucked them by not paying for reinforcements. Unsurprisingly, they had agreed.</p>
<p class="cnM3MWU5MGE5NmM4MDQwM2Q4N2I3M2IxNWI0ZDhkYjg3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNiMDM0OWY0NDQzODRhYTBhZDE3ODc3OWUyOTk2MWY2" style="margin-bottom: 0">The first team was to go in and deal with Ramil directly. That job was for Master Dooku, Jaster, and the others.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZGM4MzBjNGRhNzQwOWRiMDI3ZTAxYzUwZGQ5ZDE5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMzYWMzZWE2ZTQyNjRjNDRiZDczNWExNjQxM2JhNDBi" style="margin-bottom: 0">The second team was made up of the rebel army, led by Master Dyas. They would serve as a distraction for the droid army ground forces.</p>
<p class="cnM1OGI2ZTQ3NDZiMTRiNzZhNDFmNTE4NjNjNWQyNjA2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM4NTFiNDRkZDA1ZjQ5NWVhNmEyYjM4YzBhMzI4ZTdi" style="margin-bottom: 0">The third team—myself, Jango, and our best Mando troops—would be making an insertion by jetpack to take out the droid command vessels. They didn’t have a mothership, so control of the droids was left to a group of five command and control vessels—four, now that we had captured one and proven that shutting it down would shut off the droids connected to it. All four of those were sitting safely behind their army—at least, <em>they believed </em><em>they were</em><em> safe</em><span style="font-style: normal">.</span></p>

Distantly, we heard the sounds of fire from various sized blasters—a constant stream from small arms, the steady thump of larger crew served weapons, and the rhythmic pounding of cannons. The others looked to Jango, who in turn looked to me. I shook my head, even as I checked the chronometer built into my computation orb.</span></p>

The rebel forces swept in from the southwest—maybe two thousand men strong, on top of a mechanized battalion worth of tanks and other vehicles with mounted weapons. Blaster fire swept across the battlefield like rain—a chaotic mess of men, droids, and machines all hammering away at each other.</span></p>

Not the distant booms of explosions—</span><span style="font-style: normal">that was a familiar sound that I could fall asleep to. No, this was new—at least, at this </span><em>scale</em><span style="font-style: normal">. The anger, terror, horror, rage, righteous fury, and so much more of men and women pushed to the brink and finally given an outlet, unleashing all of that pent up emotion upon the enemy as they fought with their hearts as much as their bodies.</span></p>

<p class="cnM4NTY4ZWQxMTgxNDQ2NzhiMGI2YjFjNmZjNzE3ZDM1" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">“Dive!” Jango ordered, and the men abruptly changed course, breaking off into small groups their individual targets. I followed, accelerating ahead of them into a powered dive. I scanned our targets as Jango’s voice came over my earpiece again. “Tanya, the ships—”</p>
<p class="cnM5ZjMwMmY3ZDY2YTQ0YjY4Yjc3ZGUyN2NjNjUyZWNh" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNkZmU1NDhhMjM2MDRjYzhhODhkYjVmZmE0ZTVlYjU1" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">“I see them,” I murmured in acknowledgement, pulling my carbine up and spinning up a sniping formula. Locking on, I fired as we descended—four white-silver bolts flying out and turning an equal number of droids manning turrets on top of the ships into so much scrap.</p>

I had one to myself while the others all went three to a ship. We moved almost as one to where our investigations had shown was the best location to breach from to quickly disable the ship. While the others set breaching charges on theirs, my lightsabers floated off of my belt and turned on, blades pointed down.</p>

Blaster bolts flew through the air, nearly intersecting in the area over my head that an adult’s torso would have occupied.</span></p>

Droids were cut into glowing parts and blasted into fragments as I rolled away from my initial landing position to reposition behind a central column in what passed for a bridge or control room.</p>
