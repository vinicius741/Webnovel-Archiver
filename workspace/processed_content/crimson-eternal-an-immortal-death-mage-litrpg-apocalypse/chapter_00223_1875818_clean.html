    Vortel
   </span>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<strong>
    Description:
   </strong>
<span>
    The World of Vortel is a world where one tenth of the population will be born with a special ability. These ability users are classified in two different ways. Special Class Ability Holders, or SCAH, who have a unique ability that no one else has ever had before, and Regular Ability Holders, or RAH.
   </span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The abilities come in various different classifications:
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Physical: Physical Ability Holders gain an increase to their body in some physical manner such as superstrength or speed.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Magical: Magical Ability Holders gain the ability to use one magical element and gain a mana pool to go along with the element.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Special: Special Ability Holders are the in between. The abilities that cannot be classified in the other two classifications but are still abilities. These can include a hybrid of Physical and Magical, or neither. Some examples include the ability to use a single powerful attack, the ability to set yourself on fire but feel no pain and take no damage, or the ability to nullify abilities. But these abilities do not give the user any mana to use.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   There is only one continent on Vortel as all of the others have been destroyed over the years through war, leading to the Great Acclaims being established, banning the use of strategic abilities and strictly enforcing it within both nations to lock down any person with a strategic level ability and restrict the use of their ability.

Death is seen as a reward in the Dynasty and not a punishment. Only those who have done enough for the nation are allowed to die. Meanwhile those who do die yet have not done enough are raised as undead and forced to work until they have done enough if they killed themselves, or they will be resurrected if they were killed by other means such as murder. However, various other factors may influence it as well, such as how much benefit the being in particular may grant the nation.

    Shengshi Dynasty
   </strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<strong>
    Description:
   </strong>
<span>
    A harsh nation on both natives and non-natives alike with a level of technology on the lower end of the universe. It is ruled by the emperor with a council of state officials who got the highest scores on various tests to earn their positions.
   </span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The nation has no measures in place to help out the poor or the struggling, and purposefully uses them to benefit the higher ranking members of their society. Whether they got to where they are through birth or skill. And the nation does not trust outsiders in the slightest, only allowing them in unimportant cities while banning them from more important cities to the nation.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The military is led by a single general who has the same ranking in regards to military decisions as the princes of the nation. Meanwhile the emperor has the authority to direct where a war will go, however he has no control over what exact actions the military will take in any particular war.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The governing of the nation is split between the state officials, the emperor, and the consorts, with each having their own responsibilities. Meanwhile the consorts are all titled off of different flowers.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The nation currently has six consorts, including the Rose Consort, the Daisy Consort, the Lily Consort, the Orchid Consort, the Chrysanthemum Consort, and the Azalea Consort. Meanwhile there are two princes and no princesses within the nation.

    Grand Silvanian Empire
   </strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<strong>
    Description:
   </strong>
<span>
    The second largest empire in the world in terms of pure number of owned planets and citizens, with the Dread Empire being the largest. It largely specializes in healers and protection and has a strange focus on medieval aesthetics. One beginning with its emperor. And it is ruled absolutely by the Emperor of the Grand Silvanian Empire, with the other nobles each having some sway with him as he does truly listen to his noble court.
   </span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The nation makes up the majority of the healer market around the universe, providing healers through the Healer’s Order to every world with ties to the nation. Meanwhile they fund themselves largely through the Spires and the magical iron and magical steel within, which are leagues below the powerful magical silver but still incredibly powerful for a naturally found metal, and worth an extremely large sum. One large enough to fund the running of thousands of worlds.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The Grand Silvanian Empire is in a constant cold war against all of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse except for Aria, who of which the emperor considers like a niece to him.

<strong>
    Dread Empire
   </strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<strong>
    Description:
   </strong>
<span>
    The Dread Empire is in a constant state of starvation. It is ruled absolutely by the Horseman of the Apocalypse, Famine, who has zero cares for his own people outside of their use as a source of famine to level him up. However, he tries to stop killing as much as possible for no other reason than to have more people to starve. So the nation still has the lowest death count out of most nations in the universe despite it being the worst place to live.
   </span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Additionally, the Dread Empire is the largest nation in the universe in both number of worlds owned and population. With tens of thousands of worlds under its control and quadrillions of people.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Meanwhile every last citizen including the nobles are required to sign a body contract blocking them from killing themselves or allowing others to kill themselves in any way whether directly or indirectly. They are also forced to obey incredibly cruel laws meant to put them in a constant state of starvation and fear.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The military is directly under the control of Famine’s Nine Generals and his Grand General, who of which has a perfect cloning ability reliant on illusion magic, unlike the Crimson Empire’s Class S perfect ability user that uses life and death magic.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   There are no officers in the military as the Dread Empire’s method of fighting often tends to be simply throwing their soldiers in numbers at their enemies without a care for their lives. Then reviving them afterwards by paying a massive price to their levels with void mages, their nation having been banned from the Void Temples long ago.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Every single world at the end of the day is governed by one of the Grand General’s clones. With a substitute governor assigned from the upper class nobility.

     Revival is possible if a strong enough void mage or a Void Spirit is present. They are capable of pulling a soul from the void and placing it back in the body at a significant cost levels from the one revived. However, conditions have to be fulfilled for the revival to work. Such as the being who is getting revived needing to be at least level 10 if it is a void mage doing the resurrection. However, a Void Spirit can revive most people with only a few restrictions.
    </span>

</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<em>
<span>
     Every world has a World Core where the users of the System are allowed to reset or lower their levels. However, these changes are permanent and cannot be revoked. Furthermore, people are not capable of forcing others to reset their levels as the System will detect attempts to do so.
    </span>
</em>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<em>
<span>
     Invasions of new worlds are considered an honor for those who participate, and entire forces are created just to prepare for invasions, filled with people who have either stopped themselves from leveling or have had their levels purposefully reset to 1 at a World Core.
    </span>
</em>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<em>
<span>
     Coordinates of new worlds are found by spatial magic users, and the worlds are classified by a division of seers from the Arcadian Society into five different Tiers. Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Epsilon, with Alpha being the highest Tier.
    </span>
</em>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<em>
<span>
     These Tiers are decided based on planet size, population, quantity and quality of Ability Holders, and resources.

<p>
<span>
<em>
<span>
     Level of the user plays an important role in society outside of Vortel. Meanwhile most adults are already at least level ten, with the higher level average adults being around level 20.
    </span>
</em>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<em>
<span>
     Raising the level of someone’s class has various effects on the user in question. Some of them include but aren’t limited to raising their physical strength, their mental capacity, their magical power, their mana capacity, and their lifespan.
    </span>
</em>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<em>
<span>
     Every user in the System tends to live for around 100 years on average, with every 100 levels doubling the user’s total lifespan.
    </span>
</em>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<em>
<span>
     Worlds across the universe vary in their levels of technology and magical understanding, with Vortel’s level of technology being just a small amount above the average level of technology in the universe, and their understanding of magic a little above that.

However, all of the money of the household was taken away by those who killed her family off, and she is the only one left because it is impossible to kill her. So as the only way the Emperor could think of to get rid of her, he sent her to the frontlines where she is expected to fight for eternity for the Empire.

He acts kind and jokes with everyone but when it comes to his job, he is ruthless and follows Striker’s orders to a T. He sees Aria as a weapon to be used, just like himself. So he has nothing against her joining the team and welcomes her. He has gray hair and eyes and is in his late thirties in age. Psionic Inquisitor.
