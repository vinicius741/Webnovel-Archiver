   “Checkmate,” the dragon said.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Before Emma could even react, Lunaria climbed across the table, and knocked the pieces over. The half naked dragon pressed her lips against Emma’s in a wet kiss. Lunaria’s hands snaked behind Emma and let free the restraints holding Emma’s top.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The vampire was attacked by a relentless and long tongue that pushed into her mouth. Emma’s body was on fire, and each second was worse than the last.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Lunaria cupped Emma’s shamefully wet pussy possessively. The dragon pulled away from their kiss and released a husky breath onto Emma’s ear. “There is no running away from me this time.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma couldn’t voice any protest. Her fangs bit down into her own hand to stop the yelp of pleasure threatening to escape her. She felt Lunaria’s hand operating on the vampire’s lower lips. They dug playfully into the skin on her wet labia, and it sent a jolt of electricity through Emma’s body.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Lunaria pushed Emma down against the wooden floor and climbed on top of her. The dragon’s tongue trailed a line up Emma’s chin and pushed back into the vampire’s mouth.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   All of the teasing Emma was forced to endure had brought her close to the edge. She was full of anticipation. Her toes coiled, and her legs felt like wrapping around her attacker. A sweet whimper left her throat, and the dragon used that as her cue.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Lunaria pressed a large finger into Emma’s tight entrance. She coiled it, trying to get Emma to spread wider for her. Her thumb pressed against Emma’s clit in the same motion.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   This pinch felt on both sides was enough to send Emma over the edge. She cried out as she climaxed, and her body tensed. Her legs wrapped around Lunaria like a vice grip.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma felt Lunaria digging out her insides as she rode out her orgasm. The vampire’s moans of pleasure had become a nice background noise. It was like the buzzing of bees for their sweet nectar.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The dragon playfully pinched Emma’s hardened nipples. “Don’t think you can escape from me yet, little vixen.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   A whine was drug out of Emma’s throat. She grew afraid to speak, fearing that if she tried it would come out embarrassing.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Lunaria dragged herself down Emma’s body, licking the vampire on the way down.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   It occurred to Emma just how long the dragon’s tongue was in that moment, and a new anticipation struck her core. She realized how much she wanted that inside of her.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   However, the dragon decided to use this opportunity to tease her. She stopped just below Emma’s belly button. “You haven’t said much since this whole thing started.”

  <p align="left">
   Emma’s face heated up. Her hands gripped the dragon’s horns, but she found that no matter how hard she pushed them down, she couldn’t move the strong Lunaria.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The dragon chuckled. “You’re such a cute little thing, but I can’t understand the sounds coming from you. You’ll have to say it clearly.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “I want…”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma bit down on her lip as the dragon pressed her finger against the vampire’s clit. Emma’s mind had tuned out everything in the world, and there was only one thing she wanted. So she tried again.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “Your tongue…”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Luckily, the dragon didn’t tease her anymore. Lunaria smiled. “You’re such a greedy little thing, but I’ll help you.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma felt herself being spread even wider by Lunaria’s impossibly long tongue. It was even longer than the dragon’s fingers, and it pushed far inside.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   As Lunaria started to eat the sweet honey, she pulled down her own skirt and panties. The dragon played with herself while she pleasured Emma.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   <em>
    I’m already getting close again.
   </em>
   Emma didn’t care that her moans made her sound slutty in this moment. Her high pitched cries only spurred the dragon onward. Emma couldn’t believe how great the dragon’s tongue felt writhing inside of her.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The vampire’s insides clenched tightly around the invading tongue, and Emma found herself grabbing hard onto the horns of the girl beneath her. Her body shivered and released more sweet honey for the dragon to enjoy.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   It seemed that Emma’s reaction was enough to send the dragon over the edge as well. The horns in Emma’s hands vibrated with the pleasure of Lunaria.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The dragon pulled her tongue from Emma and lapped at Emma’s sensitive pussy. She cleaned Emma with a satisfied smile on her lips. When she was done, she leapt to her feet and picked Emma up in a princess carry.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The vampire's face was flooded with heat, and her heart thumped in her chest. She grew keenly aware of the dragon’s gaze as it roamed over her body. It was as if Lunaria was planning whether or not they should go for another time.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “I can’t believe you,” Emma said. “First, you attack me, and now you treat me like a princess.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Lunaria grinned and kissed Emma on the forehead. “You are very welcome, my queen.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “Your queen?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The dragon placed Emma on the bed and shuffled up next to her, wrapping them both in a thick blanket, and wrapping her tail around Emma in the process. “Right now, you’re the greatest queen in all of the lands.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma felt her heart continue to throb as the dragon pet her head. “I still can’t believe we did that…”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “We can do it again, and then it will be certain that it happened.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   <em>
    This fucking dragon!
   </em>
   Emma bit down into Lunaria’s neck without hesitation, pleased with herself from the shivering of the dragon’s body.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “You little rascal,” The dragon said. “If you keep doing stuff like this, then I will use my tail next time.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma looked down at the large tail wrapping around her and shook her head. “No way! You would never fit that inside!”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “I don’t think we could say for certain, unless we tried…”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “Don’t! That would break me in half. Believe me, I’m certain.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The dragon raised her eyebrow and grinned smugly. “Okay, but can I have another kiss instead?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma nodded shyly, not caring that she might taste herself, and raised her head to meet the dragon’s lips in a sweet peck. Despite being hesitant at first, Emma found herself unable to resist the temptations of Lunaria. The temptress dragon had completely capture the poor vampire in her clutches.
