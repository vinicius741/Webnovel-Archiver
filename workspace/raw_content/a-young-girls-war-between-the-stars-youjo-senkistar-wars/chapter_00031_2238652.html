<p class="cnMzNmNlZmQ3NDYwYTQxMzdiOWVhMTEyZmFhNmQ0M2Q4" style="margin-bottom: 0">With Obi gone on a mission and having been told to avoid the temple, I found myself a bit at loose ends in the days following my debrief with the High Council. So, I fell into a bit of a routine: morning exercises followed by study and breakfast, lunch and some time spent exploring Coruscant, then more training in the afternoons, followed by supper and meditation with my computation orb.</p>

Very much a tomboy though—not that it was a bad thing.</span></p>

<p class="cnNhMDNjMDY3ZTUwZjQ4NjJiMGFkNmQzZjQxN2FhOTg0" style="margin-bottom: 0">As for the droid, I’d purchased an R3 astromech. T<span style="font-style: normal">hose were reserved for military or government agencies due to their much higher specs and better sensors than the R2 unit, but the Jedi happened to be a</span> government agency <span style="font-style: normal">and a little </span><em>gentle persuasion</em><span style="font-style: normal"> was enough to get one fresh out of the box. Before I even activated it, I did a little digging on the space internet for </span><em>unlicensed and definitely illegal</em><span style="font-style: normal"> modifications that one </span><em>absolutely should not</em><span style="font-style: normal"> make to their R2 droid, to see what the current consensus was on arming them.</span></p>

<p class="cnM5ZWM1NTVkYTRhMDRkZjg5ZTc3MDUzNjQ5NTliZWJl" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal">There were a frankly shocking number of modifications possible, but I quickly sorted through the wheat from the chaff. The most popular and most useful places for larger weapons were all exterior. Apparently, </span><span style="font-style: normal">with a little bit of modification to install a universal hardpoint adapter,</span><span style="font-style: normal"> the upper section of the legs where they connected with the main body made for an excellent mounting point for a variety of weapons from missile launchers, to flamethrowers, to blaster rifles—and power and data for any targeting system could be spliced right into a data port on the leg.</span><span style="font-style: normal"> While you </span><em>could</em><span style="font-style: normal"> mount something on the domed head, that would defeat the purpose of getting an R3 model just as surely as replacing the clear dome with an opaque one, or painting over it like an idiot and in so doing, </span><em>obscure the sensors I paid goo</em><em>d</em><em> money for!</em><span style="font-style: normal"> </span></p>

<p class="cnM0NDk0ZDEzNjBkMzQ1OTlhMzk4Zjk4YzJkY2U2Njdm" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">Internally, there were all sorts of modifications one could make, but one of the most popular was a hidden storage compartment carrying a variety of tools—from a holdout blaster, to grenades, extra ammunition, or in my case even a spare lightsaber. There were also mentions of adding an extra manipulator arm that could wield small tools that were otherwise impossible for that type of droid to use, or even pick up.</p>

<p class="cnNmNmNhN2I4ZDRkZDQ2M2Y4NTVhOGRiNTQyOTE0NjY3" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">I also did a deep dive comparison between the various astromechs available on the market to see what features had been added—or cut—from them lately. Then, I made a list of components that other R-series had and the R3 lacked, and found some instruction manuals for conversion and installation, so I could upgrade mine.</p>

Then again, I had been busy dealing with Arthree and installing parts, so it was entirely possible I hadn’t heard the sound of my holocom beeping over his complaints in binary. I didn’t speak machine language, but the tones were easy enough to understand—</span><span style="font-style: normal">and while I was </span><em>tempted</em><span style="font-style: normal"> to install a module to let him speak in Basic, everything I’d read online had </span><em>strongly</em><span style="font-style: normal"> advised against it.</span></p>

<p class="cnM4MmU2ZjkyMzVjNTQ2NDY5OWFhMjg0NWRmOWQyMWUy" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">“I pointed out the same thing,” Master Dooku shook his head. “None of them can be recalled in time to complete this in a timely manner, and most of them are either doing something they can’t simply walk away from, or they are out of contact. Instead, Jedi from nearly every part of the Order have been tapped for this mission—most of them volunteers.”</p>

Tython is the birthplace of the Jedi Order—or rather, the home of the Je’daii, who then became the Jedi. They were much more… open in their approach to the Force then, than we are now—working with both the light and dark sides of the Force, until the Force Wars divided the Je’daii Order along ideological lines between light and dark and led to the creation of the Jedi and Sith orders. There is a worry that something, a temple, library, holocrons, or other artifacts may be intact—along with leftover ancient technology spanning over thirty thousand years of history. That is, again, in addition to the potential danger of wildlife or those who have made it their home since the Jedi last left.”</p>

Am I allowed to hire contractors or outside forces, or am I supposed to do this solo? Obviously, you can’t realistically expect a single Padawan to conduct detailed scans and investigation of things I’m not even aware would be important. What materials and resources are the Order providing? If I purchase materials myself, will I be reimbursed?”</p>

With the emphasis on information security, that ruled out any of the large, private survey firms on Coruscant—or most places, really. Nowhere that would have to write down where money came from and account for their location.</p>

Eventually, I would design a small system to install different loadouts automatically, instead of doing it by hand, but that may have to wait until I got a bigger ship, because I wasn’t sure I could fit it on the <em>Rusted Silver</em>.</p>

Well, let’s start with the basics. You’ll need a ship, a pilot, a mechanic or engineer, and a medic.

Thankfully, I’d be forwarding that to the Temple and letting them handle it.</p>

<p class="cnM2M2MzZTk1ZjU1ODRkODNhMGZlODQzYmQ2NzMyN2Q2" style="margin-bottom: 0">Once they got the units down, the freighter pulled away and broke orbit while a group of four troop transports landed. I put away my canteen and stood, getting back to work. Pulling out my lightsaber, I made quick work of the tree trunks, cutting them down to the lengths I wanted and using the Force to move them around the camp. The Force was a very handy tool to help dig a trench around the camp to place them in for a base for the wall, then make more holes to stand supports for the wall up. It wasn’t long before I had a group of six Mandos going behind me, working on the finer details with power tools—something I knew they were all familiar with, since we’d had to construct more than one temporary fortification and shelter on Serenno.</p>

<p class="cnMzNzhlZjJlNjU2NTRjYzNiZGU4ZTEwNmVmZWQzNzUz" style="margin-bottom: 0">Eventually, one of the Mandos came up and pulled off his helmet, before giving a sloppy salute. I stood and returned it, waiting. “Everything’s all set up, commander. Gear checks out. Power’s connected and water lines run to the river. The eggheads are setting up their lab how they want it and figure they’ll start taking initial samples within the hour. Squad Two’s on babysitting duty for now and manning the comms and security gear. Squad Three are going to help set up fortifications and our defenses—they’ll have an observation tower and our emplacements set up soon. Air support is currently doing aerial recon and taking photos, if they find anything they’ll call it in. Squad One is going to get chow and rack out in an hour so we can get into a proper sleep rotation.”</p>

<p class="cnNhMjRiMGNjOGJmNjQ3OTVhNjVkYjM4MThjZTIzZmQ3" style="margin-bottom: 0">“I’m aware of them. They’re not ‘freak’ storms. They appear to be caused by fluctuations in the Force.” I brought my hands up, “Positive and negative energy rub together,” I brought them together to do just that, “and create lightning. It is something to be concerned about. If we get one in the area, make sure whoever is on watch brings up the shield.”</p>

<p class="cnM0NmZmY2Q1ZTU4ZjRmYzE4YzU5YTIyMThiOTAxMDI3" style="margin-bottom: 0">It was honestly rather intriguing, the natural interplay of light and dark and its effects here. Given my own nature and how every Master I’d spoken with had noticed the balance of both light and dark within me, it left me wondering if I couldn’t duplicate the effect and thereby skip some of the effort required to make Force Lightning the normal way. But that was something to test later.</p>

<p class="cnM5NGU2Zjk2NTAyMDQxYmJhZTA4YTA5Zjg4NDY1ZTcz" style="margin-bottom: 0">I chuckled. “Let’s hope we brought enough weapons to deal with it. I’d rather not have to face off against another dragon,” I murmured, and the man nodded. “Dismissed.”</p>

Stretching briefly, I turned back to my work of securing the camp after sending off a quick message to Taria letting her know that the camp had been established and my team would start work soon. As I worked, I focused on my Force senses and just listened, feeling the natural interplay of Force around me—like swimming in the ocean as the waves came and went, washing over me as I mentally floated there.</p>
