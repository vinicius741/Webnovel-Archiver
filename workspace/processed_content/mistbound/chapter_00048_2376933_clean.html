   Terrance struggled not to grind his teeth as he guided the group into the inner city, where his family used to live. His steps were brisk, almost forceful, as if he could stomp out the anger simmering inside him. He didn’t need to look over his shoulder to know that Maeryn was moping, emotionally injured by his straightforward expression of his feelings.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   She had no right. How dare she act like she was the injured party, when she was the one who put the idea in his head? The idea that made all too much sense, if he could just put aside his feelings and look at the greater goal.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance hadn’t known she was capable of that kind of cruelty. Sure, she’d hesitated before speaking. Yes, she’d tried to apologize. But at that moment, Terrance just flat-out did not care.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Guess she took that little lecture of focusing on the mission to heart,” he muttered uncharitably under his breath as he made a right turn, ducking into a side-street that he vaguely recognized from his childhood. In fact, that was the old bakery he used to love. They had the best sweet rolls in the city, or so he’d thought as a kid. It was nice to see they were still in business.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance shook off the old memories, focusing on the present. They were almost there. They were almost home.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   His heart skipped a beat at the thought, and Terrance grimaced. He didn’t know what to expect here. Or what to hope for. Did he want the building to look exactly as he left it, all those years ago? Did he want it to be torn down, destroyed like his childhood had been? Did he want it to be under disrepair, but able to be restored, like his family name?
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   His heart offered no answers, and Terrance cursed it silently, clenching his jaw and his fists to try to contain the volatile emotions that threatened to overflow within him. It didn’t really matter what he wanted, did it? It wasn’t as though that would change the outcome.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   It never had before. Not when it mattered.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Um, Terrance?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The rogue blinked, refocusing on the present, and realized that Ernesto was trying to get his attention. “Yeah, what is it?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “You know we… don’t really have to do this, right? We can try to find something else.” Ernesto’s expression was both pained and empathetic as he made an aborted motion to reach out and touch his arm. “I… lost my Master and had to bury him myself. I haven’t been back there since. I don’t know when I’ll be ready to do that, and…” He shook his head. “You shouldn’t force yourself.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance swallowed the lump in his throat that had formed at the necromancer’s words. He took a deep breath and let it out slowly, trying to find his words, trying not to let his grief and anger take control; Ernesto didn’t deserve that. “My parents died eight years ago,” he said quietly. “It’s past time for me to face that. And much as I hate it, this really is the best option for now. I’ll be fine. Eventually.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Ernesto looked at him thoughtfully, then nodded. “Okay. But… if you want… once we’re all safe inside or something… I can try to use
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Summon Spirit
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   to call for your parents? Let you say goodbye properly?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance flinched, then swallowed the bile that rose in his throat. He wanted it. Skies above, he wanted it. And he knew that Ernesto was being sincere and benign with the offer, which made it worse. But he absolutely could not allow a necromancer, no matter how friendly, to bind his parents’ spirits in any way.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “No thanks,” he forced himself to say. “Maybe another time.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Ernesto nodded slowly, and Terrance wondered if the necromancer had somehow perceived his thoughts and fears. “Okay. Offer stands, whenever you want.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Sure.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “By the way, speaking of spirits,” Frankie joined in, “what happened with Keith? I couldn’t see him when I woke up, and no one’s mentioned him, and I haven’t felt any weird patches of cold air, so… is he gone or something?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Oh. I’m not completely sure, but… I think I’m not skilled enough to hold the spell when I’m unconscious,” Ernesto answered quietly. “So Keith vanished when I fell asleep. I can summon him again using the same spell, I think, but I did promise that next time I’d have a good book for him to read.”

   Terrance felt a flash of irritation at the necromancer. Part of him wished the guy would stop being so damn likable and friendly. Necromancers weren’t supposed to be friendly. They weren’t supposed to be altruistic. They weren’t supposed to be kind or gentle or anxious!
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   He’d been watching Ernesto like a hawk since learning his nature as a necromancer back on Airspire. He’d spied on Dan and Ernesto for entire afternoons at a time, followed Ernesto discreetly the few times he went out on his own to get food, and all of Terrance’s efforts had given him absolutely nothing to suggest that his fears were founded.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   He really was… just a humble necromancer who wanted to make the world a better place, and make his Master proud. With a penchant for cheese. Honestly, Terrance hadn’t really believed him about making cheese via necromancy until he’d witnessed it for himself one night. Cheese made by death magic had no right to smell so tasty.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Back to the point, it made Terrance feel kind of slimy for still harboring prejudices against necromancy. Especially when Ernesto so kindly offered him the gift of talking to his parents one more time, no strings attached.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   But… he couldn’t let go of his fear. His parents’ souls were sacred. They mustn’t be touched. What if necromancy did something to them? Changed them? Warped them? Bound them? What if calling their ghosts prevented them from moving on? What if it hurt them, like in some of the stories he’d read as a child?
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   No. Ernesto was a good guy, but Terrance just could not trust necromancy. Not at all.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Well, necromancy relating to spirits or the dead, anyway, Terrance mentally amended as he spotted Maeryn out of the corner of his eye. That
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Vitality Boost
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   spell that Ernesto had apparently used on Maeryn was kind of cool.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance was so lost in his thoughts that he almost didn’t realize it when they arrived. He stopped in front of the ornate fence that lined his family home and - swallowing and wishing that his heart would stop beating so hard - looked up at the place he’d spent the first several years of his life.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The mansion before him… looked virtually unchanged from how he remembered. Three stories tall, with windows in every room of the house. Terrance’s eyes flicked to the window to the bedroom that had once belonged to James, then to the master bedroom on the top floor where he used to pounce on his parents if they were sleeping in and he was bored.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   A single tear trailed down Terrance’s cheek as he took in the sight of his childhood home. The paint was a little less vibrant, the yard a bit less well kept, but… it’d been maintained. It was still recognizable. It was still his home.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Part of him half-expected to see his parents bustling out the door - his father running late for some appointment, his mother trying to call Terrance inside to put his things away and not make so much work for the staff. James would chuckle and offer to help Terrance put his toys away so he wouldn’t feel alone.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   And when none of those figures emerged from the house, Terrance’s heart clenched. He gripped the fence in front of him with both hands, squeezing with all his might, trying desperately not to fall to his knees as his vision went blurry with tears, as his lungs rebelled and refused to draw enough breath. He was finally home… but his family was still gone.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   A hand on his shoulder jerked Terrance’s attention away from the house, and he looked back to see Frankie and Ernesto side by side right behind him, offering understanding smiles and silent support. Terrance turned his eyes on the rest of his companions, too. Dan offered a somber nod, Peter a pained grimace, and Maeryn… When Terrance made eye contact with Maeryn, she closed her eyes and lowered her head.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   It wasn’t a gesture that Terrance had seen her make before. But… he could tell what it meant. It was a silent acknowledgment of his pain—a blend of sorrow, remorse, and respect, giving him the space he needed to just be.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The anger he’d borne just a few minutes before flared within him - Maeryn had brought him here. So what if she was trying to be respectful now, he wouldn’t be hurting right now if she hadn’t…! Terrance closed his eyes and breathed. No. No, that wasn’t fair. He’d agreed with her. He was the one who’d brought everyone here.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   He still wanted to give Maeryn a good punch to the face, but that was the pain talking, and in the end that wasn’t Maeryn’s fault. Or at least not hers alone.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance looked back at the house. The home that his family would never return to. His heart ached, but he breathed through the grief. He would survive this. Just like everything else. And then… and then what? Was he supposed to just forgive Maeryn?
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance closed his eyes again. He knew what his father would say.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   There had been an incident when he was six or so, and one of his father’s friends had done something that really hurt the Nightshade’s finances. Terrance had asked his father why they were still friends after that.
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    “Friends won’t always get along. And sometimes you’ll hurt each other. It’s inevitable. And that goes double for our line of work. The trick is figuring out your friend’s intentions. Was it to hurt you, or was it just a necessary consequence? If it wasn’t intentional, and if they try to make amends, then… friends are worth holding on to, Terrance.”
   </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   … Maeryn hadn’t tried to hurt him. And she’d tried to apologize. Terrance let out a long sigh, opening his eyes again to look at his old home. It hurt a little less now. Maybe that was a sign. “Okay, dad,” he whispered. “Okay.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   He turned back towards the others, and purposely made eye contact with his Captain. “Maeryn. Come on, let’s go explore my old home.”
  </span>
