I spent the day with Jenza showing me around, until a minor earthquake collapsed the building we were in on top of us. We were eventually rescued by Master Yoda and it was then that we learned the truth from our father. We kept in touch by letter after that.”</p>

<p class="cnNiZThhMmIyNmY0ZDRiNzA4MzQwMzE5NTcxZDUyZDJi" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Is that it?” Satine asked quietly, sitting in the top of a tree and looking through the branches, leaves, and hanging moss of intervening trees between them and a well-lit base in the swamps to the south of Serenno City. Beside her, Obi-wan stood, one hand resting on the tree trunk as she looked through a set of binoculars.</p>

<p class="cnNjMzhlMDZlZjM1ODQ2MWI4NTgyODNhNWQ1MWM0YmUy" style="margin-bottom: 0">Satine held up the binoculars and blinked at what she saw. Several groups of humans patrolled the exterior—natives of Serenno from the look of it. All of them looked like they would rather be anywhere else and didn’t appear very attentive. They didn’t bother looking too closely at the area outside of the base—only occasionally looking that way when a jungle sound caught their ears.</p>

Looking down, Tanya faded into view, sitting on a lower branch. The red girl wore a cloak covering her distinctive red skin and white hair that would have been visible even this far out if the light happened to catch it. She had apparently done a bit of modification to her cloak to add grass and moss, leaving her looking more like a lump of plant growth sitting there than a person.</p>

Ramil was promising to deliver on the protection from pirates, slavers, and others that the Republic had promised but failed to deliver. He was using his own hired mercenaries to terrorize the locals, then having his legitimate forces come in and drive them off—but there were a <em>surprising</em><span style="font-style: normal"> lack of casualties on either side after any engagement between them. They were also claiming that our Mando forces </span><span style="font-style: normal">and the Jedi working with Jenza to attempt to secure the planet and negotiate a cease fire</span><span style="font-style: normal"> were here </span><span style="font-style: normal">as the enforcement arm of the Republic trying to prevent Serenno from leaving the Republic and declaring its independence.</span></p>

I carefully used the Force to undo the grate and slipped out, falling lightly to the floor with nary a sound. The Force closed the grate up again and I looked around the room, taking in the multitude of cardboard boxes full of generic office supplies. A smile stole over my face as I spotted an empty box.</p>
