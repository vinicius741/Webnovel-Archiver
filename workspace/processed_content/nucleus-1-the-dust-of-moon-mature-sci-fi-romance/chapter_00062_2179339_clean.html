    Osram Time: 07:15, February 24, 2295
   </strong>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Bunk 239, Outpost Tumi, Zeeman Crater, Far Side, Osram
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari bolted upright at the harsh blare of an emergency alert. The Crystal fragment in his pocket felt warm against his thigh where he'd kept it through the night.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The announcement system crackled to life. "All Kimaris Warband officers report to the war room. Repeat: all Kimaris officers to the war room immediately."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari dressed quickly, making sure the Crystal fragment was secure. The corridors were filled with personnel moving with purpose, tension on their faces.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   In the war room, Laurent N'Guessan stood over a holographic display with Seydou. Wilhelm leaned against a wall, arms crossed, his usual carefree look replaced by something more guarded. Ume stood quietly in a corner in her black and red robes, watching.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What's going on?" Jabari asked.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Laurent looked up, his expression serious. "We received a communication request. From someone who claims to have information about the Crystal fragment."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Someone?" Jabari raised an eyebrow. "Who exactly?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Sand Lotus," Seydou replied.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Laurent turned to Seydou. "The terrorist organization that's been at war with the Imperium for decades? Why would they contact us?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   An awkward silence fell over the room. Jabari and Seydou exchanged glances.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What am I missing?" Laurent demanded.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Wilhelm spoke up, his tone stiffer than usual. "What's that old saying...'The enemy of my enemy'?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "May as well be Radi-Mons." Laurent's voice was dangerously calm. "Care to explain why everyone here except me seems unsurprised, Major?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Wilhelm stood straight, leaving the wall. "During your absence, Prince Laurent, certain decisions had to be made."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Such as allying with a religious terrorist organization?" Laurent's voice rose.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Sand Lotus helped us secure U6-M9," Seydou said, raising his hands. "Without them, she could have been in the scrapeyard by now."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I assume consulting me wasn't an option?" Laurent's jaw tightened.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Before he could continue, Seydou interrupted. "The transmission is coming through. Should we accept?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   After a tense moment, Laurent nodded. "Put it through."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   An Imperial woman appeared in the hologram. She had short, straight-cut black hair framing an elegant face with high cheekbones and full lips painted crimson. Her eyes were bright beneath straight bangs, and she wore a flowing kimono with floral patterns. She looked both young and somehow timeless.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Fuuka! It's been some time." Jabari stepped forward, unable to hide his relief.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The woman smiled. "Lieutenant Adomako. I'm pleased to see you well." She looked around the room. "Wilhelm, Seydou." Her eyes lingered on Ume. "And Ume, of course."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari stiffened, noticing her formal tone with him.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Rishi Natsukawa," Laurent cut in. "This is unexpected."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Prince N'Guessan," Fuuka bowed slightly. "Your return brings joy to many hearts. The rumors of your death were greatly exaggerated."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "As were reports of the Sand Lotus's commitment to peace," Laurent replied coolly. "How did you know my current state?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "We have reliable sources."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Without disclosing those sources, cooperation would be difficult."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It'd involve disclosing details of your...recent visits to Venus." Fuuka smiled slightly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari noticed Laurent's eyes narrowing. Wilhelm tensed. After a brief silence, the Prince gave in. "In my absence, you've formed a pact with the Kimaris Warband. An explanation?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Times of crisis forge unusual bonds. The Fenris Horde grows daily, and the Moondust Crystal fragments must be retrieved before they fall into the wrong hands."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The wrong hands," Laurent repeated with a sly grin. "Last I heard, you don't even plan on using it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Not in its full form, no," Fuuka replied, raising a finger. "The Crystal is a sacred artifact not fit for human or Radi-Mon use."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yet despite that, the Sand Lotus have decided to aid us, a faction with every reason to deploy it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "After the Imperium annexed Taiwan, we know we can't fight them alone." Fuuka stepped aside as a new figure entered the frame. "I've brought someone who can offer more insight."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The man who appeared was tall with a weathered face that looked centuries old rather than decades. He had beige-colored skin that appeared properly sun-tanned, and his neatly trimmed beard was streaked with silver, and his green eyes carried the weight of countless experiences.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Elder Thorin Hǫggsson," Fuuka introduced, "Sand Lotus High Council member and our foremost expert on the Moondust Crystal."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Foremost living expert," Thorin corrected, with a faint Nordic accent. "The true experts are long gone."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari stepped forward. "Elder Thorin, we've secured the fragment as discussed. But its markings are concerning."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Show me," Thorin said.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   With a nod from Laurent, Jabari took the Crystal fragment from his pocket. It pulsed with soft blue light as he held it up to the scanner.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The image appeared beside Thorin and Fuuka. The Elder leaned closer to examine the runes on the surface.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "'Harald var hér,'" he read aloud. "Harald was here."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You know what this means?" Jabari asked.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I used to know the man," Thorin replied grimly. "Harald Omdal, the Archimage of Buskerud. A man with limitless ambitions."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Laurent interrupted. "The mad Nordling scholar who disappeared after the Nucleus Virus outbreak in Scandinavia."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The very one," Thorin nodded. "Though 'mad scholar' is too simple. Harald infiltrated the Vault of Primal Urges and divided the Moondust Crystal in '84, when the Fenris Horde began conquering Earth's Arctic Circle. He wanted to study it, hoping to defeat the Fenris Horde on his own terms..."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A third figure moved into frame beside Fuuka. This man had deep bronze skin and wore traditional emerald and ivory robes with golden embroidery along the borders. Ceremonial beads hung around his neck, and a small black bindi marked his forehead.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Forgive my delay," the man said. "I am Amir Talwar, Warstaff Master of the Inner Sol Sangha."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Another high-ranking Sand Lotus member," Laurent said dryly. "Is this a diplomatic call or a show of force?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Amir's eyes hardened slightly. "Neither, Prince Laurent. It is a matter of mutual survival."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "If you want our help restoring the Crystal, simply banning us from using it won't work," Laurent said firmly. "Such restraints are impractical when our enemies won't play by the same rules."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari nodded at Laurent, grateful for his assertion. The Crystal fragment pulsed warmly in his pocket. "We're willing to negotiate if you are," he said.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Thorin stroked his beard, his face concerned. "Our intelligence suggests the Imperium has already breached Door Kaamos using the forbidden Blood Rain Aria. They'll soon secure Moondust's main body."
  </span>
 </p>
 <span>
  <br/>
  You could be reading stolen content. Head to the original site for the genuine story.
  <br/>
 </span>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Meanwhile, the Alliance has opened the seal on Door Valkyris, though with a more appropriate method," Fuuka added.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "But Valkyris has been infested by an Exo-Horde since Harald's infiltration," Amir said to Fuuka. "I'm surprised the vault door even works."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Exo-Horde?" Jabari asked, catching the unfamiliar term.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Radi-Mons from outside the Sol System," Fuuka said. "Not your concern."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "As if the Five Realms weren't big enough already," Wilhelm quipped with a grin.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Silence hung between them, broken only by the hum of the holographic projector.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "See? Our opponents are already ahead," Seydou cut in nervously. "I mean, they might soon be ahead. Technically." He raised a finger.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "But with the Directorate's firepower, you shouldn't need to use Moondust," Fuuka said to Jabari.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Well..." Jabari's cheeks flushed. "I guess not."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Logical fallacy!" Seydou leaned forward. "Eventually we'll face those who have parts of Moondust. They use it, we don't. Guess who wins?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Suddenly, an urgent sound chimed in with red lights and sirens.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Urgent message from an allied settlement!" Seydou announced, working the controls. "It's from...the Sepulcher of Ysolde?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Put it through," Laurent ordered.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The hologram of an Ologun marine appeared next to Fuuka and Amir. His green exosuit looked battle-damaged. "To all nearby Directorate settlements! The Sepulcher is under attack! We need immediate help!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Sir?" Seydou looked at Laurent.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "This is Kimaris Warband from Outpost Tumi. What's your situation?" Laurent asked.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Prince Laurent! Thank the gods—" The hologram flickered with static before resuming. "Fenris Horde. Multiple Draugs leading the assault. One of them — Skarn! He is here!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Fenris Primarch?" Wilhelm's eyes widened. "That's a bad joke."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Private, Skarn was defeated in '93 in Oslo. Him showing up suddenly is...unlikely," Laurent said calmly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Sir, I swear! I've never seen Draugs that big—" The Ologun turned around. "Shit. I think he's here—"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   With a screech of static, the hologram disappeared.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "My people rarely lie. But surely the Imperium would have kept Skarn locked up?" Laurent looked between Thorin, Fuuka, and Amir.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "We heard similar claims from Taiwan last week. I thought they were just militia wanting more weapons," Fuuka said.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That changes things," Amir said, looking at Thorin.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Nordling Elder sighed and put a hand to his forehead.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Elder Thorin," Jabari said firmly, standing next to Laurent. "I think we all agree on stopping Radi-Mons when they attack."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "By my right as Elder, servant to our First Priestess Mu-Shan, I authorize you, Directorate's people, to use the Moondust Crystal BEFORE its full restoration," Thorin declared. "Use it only against our shared enemies, never against Sand Lotus members or allies."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Thank you, Elder Thorin," Laurent smiled triumphantly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "We won't let you down!" Jabari said.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He noticed Fuuka looking at him with interest. "I suspect you won't," she said.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Fuuka, Amir. We need to prepare," Thorin said. "If the Imperium and Alliance get their pieces of the Crystal, we must intercept them."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Amir and Fuuka bowed to Thorin. As they straightened, Fuuka's eyes met Jabari's for a moment longer than necessary. Something in her expression shifted—a subtle warmth that hadn't been there before. The corner of her lips curved in a smile that seemed meant only for him.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari felt a flutter in his chest and stood straighter. An unspoken connection hung between them through the hologram. He realized belatedly that she might be deliberately cultivating his interest—and it was working.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "May the Great Void Beyond guide your path," Thorin said, breaking the moment.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "And yours," Laurent replied with a nod.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The hologram flickered and disappeared.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Laurent immediately turned to Seydou. "Check our Moon Yam supplies. Power up all defensive turrets."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yes, sir."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Scout ahead with your Anioma. I need to know what we're dealing with," he told Wilhelm.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Wilhelm saluted before heading for the door, while Ume stood quietly next to Jabari.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   No one had noticed the exchange between Jabari and Fuuka. Jabari touched the Crystal fragment, finding it warmer than before.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Laurent turned to him, hand extended. "The Crystal shard, Lieutenant. Only psionics like Celine and I can use it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari hesitated briefly, his fingers closing around the shard in his pocket. The warmth had become almost comforting. But orders were orders. With a nod, he gave it to Laurent. "Here you go, sir."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Thank you," Laurent said, studying the pulsing blue light. "We'll need every advantage if Skarn really has returned."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Prince put the Crystal in a special pouch on his belt, then paused at the door. He looked at Ume.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Ume, get dressed in your combat suit," he said, his tone softening. "Make sure your Plasma Handgun is charged. We don't know what we'll face at the Sepulcher."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Ume nodded. "Understood, Prince Laurent. I'll be ready in six minutes and fourteen seconds."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Laurent almost smiled before leaving, already giving orders through his comm. "This is Laurent to all DSC troops at Outpost Tumi. Anansi to Dahomey squads, prepare for immediate deployment. Eshu and Faro squads, stay and guard the outpost—"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As Laurent's voice faded, Ume moved to Jabari's side. "Your vital signs show elevated stress," she said quietly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Just processing," Jabari replied. "A lot has happened in the last day."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Indeed," Ume agreed. "And now we might face Skarn himself."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I'll need to repair your Scarab," Seydou said, turning off the projector and going to a storage unit. "But I have something else that might help." He returned with what looked like a long golden staff. "I was almost done working on this before we left Earth."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Is that..." Jabari stared at it, recognizing it from his training. "a Vibro-Spear?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Standard Kimaris issue. The last Scarab Rider didn't want it, and Wilhelm said it's 'not his thing,'" Seydou grinned.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Vibro-Spear unfolded and hummed to life as Seydou gave it to Jabari. The shaft felt cool in his hands, with intricate geometric patterns etched into its surface. The spearhead had a deadly edge with a green, pulsating jewel at its core.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Anything I should know?" Jabari asked, holding the spear carefully.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "For when you need to fight without your mech." Seydou pointed to a small black button near Jabari's thumb. "Press here to increase the vibration – it'll cut through most armor easily."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari nodded. "We need to get equipped fast."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Right." Seydou headed for the door. "I'll keep things running here. Celine should be awake by the time you get back."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   After Seydou left, Ume hesitated, then said, "I've analyzed data on Radi-Mon Primarchs. Our chances of survival in direct combat are...concerning."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Then we'll just have to beat the odds," Jabari said with more confidence than he felt.
  </span>
 </p>
 <hr/>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <span>
    Osram Time: 08:50, February 24, 2295
   </span>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Outside Outpost Tumi, Zeeman Crater, Far Side, Osram
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari's boots crunched on the lunar soil, sending up small clouds of dust in Osram's thin atmosphere. Earth hung like a blue jewel in the starry sky. The Moon Yams' warmth still flowed through his body, giving him strength despite the morning's events. His Plasma Rifle and new Vibro-Spear were folded and ready on his back.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Ume walked beside him, her gray combat suit adjusting to the low gravity, Plasma Handgun secured on her belt.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Laurent was ahead, his green robes billowing as he checked a device tracking seismic disturbances.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   They caught up to Laurent. Soon, the Sepulcher stood before them, its towering pillars and dragon carvings showing a mix of Maridian and Imperial architecture.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "This Sepulcher was built after the Svalbard Concordat of '93. In exchange for sealing Ysolde here in Zeeman Crater, the Imperium shared their Draconic Fusion Core blueprints with us," Laurent said as they walked.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Was that some kind of deal between us and the Imperials?" Jabari asked.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Terra Alliance was part of it too. The Imperium would seal Skarn, and the Alliance wouldn't interfere in their internal affairs," Laurent shook his head slightly. "I never liked it, but Chairman Kofi said it was necessary for our new Scarab production."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "My Scarab is KM-233. The techs mentioned that fusion core thing once," Jabari said, walking in step with the Prince.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Seydou told me the KM-2 series can run for 7 days on one battery. No recharge needed." Laurent half-smiled. "The older models only lasted 2 days max."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Wilhelm's green Anioma jet roared overhead, descending quickly as his voice came through their comms: "We have a situation. The Sepulcher's entrance...you need to see this."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The scene at the entrance was grim. Green-armored bodies lay scattered, pools of blood staining the lichens and gray lunar soil.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Shango's Schlong!" Jabari swore as they took in the carnage. Several Ologuns had been decapitated, their helmeted heads arranged in a pattern around their bodies.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Skarn's work," Laurent said, with an odd note of respect. "See how clean the cuts are? How the heads are arranged? He loves showing his dominance."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Skarn." Jabari tried to remember what he'd heard about the name. "The Atomic News said he was defeated."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Atomic News says lots of things. We know better than to trust it," Laurent grinned. "Though this would mean the Imperium failed to contain him on Earth. So much for the Concordat."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "These deaths are recent," Ume said, examining a body. "Based on the blood and tissue decay in the lunar environment — less than forty-eight hours old."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Such convenient timing," Wilhelm said through the comm. "Almost like someone knew exactly when to strike."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Is my assessment wrong, Major Wilhelm?" Ume looked confused.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "No, no. It's quite accurate!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Laurent looked up at the sky. "Get back to the outpost, Wilhelm. Keep Celine informed. We'll continue as planned."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Are you sure, sir?" Jabari asked. "If Skarn's really in there—"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "In a dungeon, air support won't help. But having Wilhelm watch from above could," Laurent cut him off. "We should hurry, before whatever Skarn's planning happens." He started down the bloody steps without waiting.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari felt Ume touch his arm. "Let's go," she said softly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He nodded, drawing his Plasma Rifle as Ume readied her handgun. Above them, Wilhelm's jet flew away, leaving them with their leader and whatever waited in the depths of the Sepulcher.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The last thing Jabari saw before descending was Earth hanging in the black sky, a reminder of everything they could lose if they failed.
  </span>
