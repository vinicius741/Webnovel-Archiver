   ith sweat beaded on his forehead, Jabari opened his eyes to the soft glow of his sleeping compartment. For a moment, disorientation claimed him. The ship's environmental systems simulated dawn, gradually increasing light levels in his compact quarters.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He sat up, careful not to hit his head on the compartment's low ceiling. The room was efficiently designed — a fold-down desk, integrated storage panels, and a viewscreen displaying Earth below. Blue oceans and white cloud patterns swirled across the homeworld, Africa's distinctive shape partially visible as the ship maintained its geosynchronous orbit.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Eleven days in space. Eleven days of equipment checks and waiting.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Stretching, Jabari accessed the small personal terminal beside his bunk. Several mission updates awaited his attention, but his thoughts drifted elsewhere. To the memory of a Spirit Lantern's golden glow. To amber eyes set in porcelain-white synthetic skin.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Fuuka and Ume. Two women—one human, one android—both of whom had begun occupying his thoughts in ways he hadn't anticipated. He glanced downward at his sleepwear, irked by the involuntary bodily discharge.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari slipped out of his bunk and padded down the narrow corridor to the hygiene pod. The door slid open with a soft hiss, revealing the compact but efficient space. He stripped off his soiled sleepwear and placed it in the cleaning receptacle. A burst of ultrasonic waves and nano-cleansing agents would have it fresh within minutes.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He stepped into the shower alcove. "Quick rinse, thirty seconds!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The pod responded with a fine mist of ionized water droplets that dissolved any residue from his skin while using minimal water.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dry within moments thanks to the air circulation system, Jabari pressed his palm against the uniform dispenser's biometric scanner. The panel slid open, presenting his standard-issue attire. The base layer, a moisture-wicking graphene weave, molded to his form as he pulled it on. Next came the reinforced gray suit, its smart fabric automatically adjusting for optimal fit.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Wonder if they have amenities like this, too, wherever she's from." he muttered to himself, recalling Fuuka's last smile as she disappeared into Nusantara's rainforest, her promise to meet again hanging in the air.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The emerald green combat armor pieces clicked into place over strategic points—chest, shoulders, forearms, shins. Each segment connected through magnetic coupling points, eliminating the need for traditional fasteners. A soft orange glow pulsed once along the armor's edges as the power systems initialized, confirming proper installation.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Less than five minutes after entering, Jabari emerged from the pod fully dressed and ready for duty. The cleaning receptacle chimed, his sleepwear now fresh and automatically folded, ready for the next use.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Ah, the sleeping lion awakens," Wilhelm's voice cut through his thoughts as the compartment door slid open. The Valoran pilot leaned against the doorframe, already dressed in his emerald uniform, golden rank insignia catching the light. "Pleasant dreams, Lieutenant?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yeah, well. It was alright." Jabari straightened, shaking off his contemplation. "Just thinking about…things."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "About a certain Sand Lotus lady with the glowing lantern?" Wilhelm's smirk was knowing. "Or the synthetic damsel we rescued from Imperial clutches?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Heat rose to Jabari's face. "About the mission," he lied, swinging his legs over the side of the bunk. "Any updates?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Right, right. The mission." Wilhelm let the topic slide, his expression shifting to something more serious. "Seydou's finally ready. Been preparing Ume for the memory extraction all night— says he's reached a critical stage in the process."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Memory extraction?" Jabari felt a sudden unease. "I thought he was just going to access her data banks."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Not so simple with a Da-Ji model, apparently." Wilhelm pushed off from the doorframe. "Whoever stored the data about the Moondust Crystal in her embedded it deep within the positronic matrix. Seydou says it's entangled with her personality subroutines."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari took a step forward. "Is she in danger?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Seydou says no, but..." Wilhelm hesitated. "He's put her into a state he calls 'deep sleep.' Says it's necessary to access the encrypted fragments without triggering security protocols."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "And Celine approved this?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "She did." Wilhelm checked his Quantum Watch. "Chairman Kofi is joining via hologram for the procedure. Must be important if it pulled him away from his Moon Yam investments."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari pulled on his boots. "Where?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Tech lab, Deck C. Thirty minutes until they begin." Wilhelm studied him with unusual seriousness. "I know you've grown attached to our synthetic friend. But remember why we brought her aboard. The data she carries could change everything."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "She's not just a data carrier, Wilhelm," Jabari said, perhaps too quickly. "She made her choice to help us."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Wilhelm raised an eyebrow but didn't press further. "Seydou said once he starts, he can't interrupt the process."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As Wilhelm left, Jabari moved back to the small washroom, splashing cold water on his face. In the mirror, his reflection looked back—determined, but with a shadow of worry in his eyes.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Isazi had been their home since escaping Nusantara, stuck in Earth orbit while waiting for specialized equipment for Ume's memory extraction. Eleven days of tactical meetings and system checks. Eleven days of getting to know the android who now trusted them with her existence.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Eleven days of wondering why the thought of her being harmed bothered him so much.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Quickly finishing his morning routine, Jabari headed for the corridor.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As he navigated toward Deck C, Jabari passed several Ologun marines, their armor bearing the distinctive Kimaris Warband insignia—the Protea King White emblem.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Good morning, Lieutenant Adomako," one of the marines intoned, saluting with a gauntleted hand. "Heard we'll be heading for Osram soon?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "So I heard." Jabari nodded at the soldier as he took a few more steps before pausing. "You guys had breakfast?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yes, sir. Jacked up and good to go." the soldier held up his Plasma Rifle passionately, safety on. "The millet porridge was fantastic!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Good, good." Jabari wasted no time as he pointed down the corridor. "Got an important meeting with Madame Celine. I'll catch you later."
  </span>

   </span>
   he tech lab hummed with energy as Jabari entered. Walls lined with holographic interfaces, crystalline memory banks glowing with stored data, and at its center, a specialized diagnostic chair where Ume sat motionless, eyes closed.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Optical cables snaked from her temples to Seydou's Android Modifier, a device resembling a complex crown of gray and blue. Each component pulsed with subtle light as it interfaced with Ume's positronic brain.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Just in time," Seydou said without looking up, fingers flying across multiple holographic panels. His technical medallions clicked softly as he worked. "Final calibration sequence initiating."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Celine stood nearby, arms crossed. Wilhelm leaned against a console, casual posture betrayed by tension in his shoulders.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari moved closer to Ume, studying her dormant state. Her synthetic features were perfectly composed, as if in peaceful sleep, but her stillness and lack of breathing were unsettling. The kimono she'd worn since their rescue had been replaced with a medical garment in Directorate emerald.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "How long will this take?" he asked, unable to mask his concern.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The extraction process should complete within the hour," Seydou replied, adjusting his protective goggles. "Though with Imperial encryption, one can never be certain. Whoever put the data did lots of hard-coding stuffs. Either they were short on time, or simply assumed nobody would hack through."
  </span>

 </span>
 <p>
  <span>
   Celine's checked the comm device in her left ear briefly before continuing. "Chairman Kofi will be joining us shortly. He wants immediate updates on our findings."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Any word on Prince Laurent?" Jabari asked, his voice carrying an edge that made Celine turn toward him.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Even with the Crystal on our list, My priority is finding the Prince," Celine stated firmly, her posture straightening. "The moment this extraction is complete, I intend to set course for Zeeman Crater, regardless of what's in the android's memory banks."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Wilhelm raised an eyebrow. "Rather decisive, aren't we, madam?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Laurent is Kimaris Warband's commander. Your commander." Celine replied, her tone leaving no room for argument. "Without him, we are operating at reduced capacity. The Crystal, whatever its value, is secondary."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A holographic pad nearby activated, coalescing into the imposing figure of Chairman Kofi Mensah. His emerald robes caught the light in complex patterns, traditional gold medallions gleaming against his chest.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Kimaris," Kofi's suave voice filled the space, his accent emphasizing certain syllables in a rhythm like traditional drums. "Status report."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Seydou straightened, adjusting his posture almost unconsciously. "Extraction procedure at seventy-eight percent, Oguamtrani. We've bypassed the initial security layers, but Imperial encryption remains formidable."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Intels says the Imperium and the Alliance are both on the move. How quickly can you complete the process?" Kofi asked, attention focused entirely on Seydou.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Chairman," Jabari interjected, stepping forward, venturing a statement that he felt would sound just right to anyone. "Ume's systems are delicate. Rushing could damage her consciousness."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kofi regarded him with mild surprise. "Your concern is noted, Lieutenant. However, the data that U6-M9 carries may be vital to Directorate interests."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Agreed, Oguamtrani," Celine added. "Once we've extracted what we need, we should immediately set course for Zeeman Crater. Prince Laurent's last known coordinates—"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "One mission at a time, Dr. Kamara," Kofi replied smoothly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Android Modifier hummed louder, its components glowing brighter as Seydou continued the extraction. On multiple screens, cascades of code flowed—strings of data so complex they resembled abstract art more than any meaningful strings to Jabari.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Five nested For-loops? Please, whoever compressed this data, I could do better when I was sophomore!" Seydou announced suddenly, excitement overtaking his usual measured tone. "Oh wait, oh wait, yes yes yes, and breakthrough achieved! Accessing primary data nodes now."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The main display shifted, showing fragmented images—crystalline structures that pulsed with inner light, ancient stonework, and maps of Osram that focused with increasing detail on two distinct locations: Mare Imbrium on the Near Side and a smaller site within an unassuming crater on the Far Side.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "There," Seydou highlighted a segment of the map. "The Moondust Crystal's primary mass appears to be located in this Vault of Primal Urges beneath Mare Imbrium. Extensive security systems, likely Neptunian in origin."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "And this second location?" Kofi's hologram moved closer to the display, his interest visibly piqued.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Seydou enlarged the image. "A fragment, separated from the main Crystal. Located in Zeeman Crater, Far Side. Much smaller, but potentially just as important. Someone must've gone through a lot of work to separate that shard."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Celine studied the display, her expression shifting subtly. "Zeeman Crater. Where Laurent disappeared."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Two objectives in the same location," Wilhelm murmured. "Convenient."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Not necessarily," Seydou cautioned, bringing up new data streams. "The fragment is at the crater's edge, while Prince Laurent's last transmission came from deeper within. Different sectors entirely."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari watched as more information materialized on the screens—schematics of ancient structures, energy readings, and fragments of what appeared to be warnings in multiple languages.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Chairman," Celine stepped forward. "With respect, our primary duty must be to Prince Laurent. If he's still in Zeeman Crater—"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I understand your loyalty, Dr. Kamara," Kofi interrupted, his tone suddenly decisive. His hologram expanded slightly. "Kimaris Warband will proceed to Zeeman Crater—not for Prince Laurent, but for the Crystal fragment. The other powers will be too occupied fighting over the main body to notice our acquisition of the shard."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Sir," Celine's voice remained steady despite the clear disagreement. "Prince Laurent—"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Will have to wait," Kofi concluded firmly. "I've dispatched Nyame Warband to conduct search operations. Your priority now is securing that Crystal fragment before anyone realizes its existence."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Celine's expression remained neutral, though Jabari could see the conflict behind her eyes. "Understood, Oguamtrani."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I'll expect regular updates on your progress," Kofi continued. With that, his hologram flickered and dissolved, leaving the tech lab in momentary silence.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Wilhelm broke the tension, pushing away from the console. "Seems our course is set, hey?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari remained by Ume's side as Seydou began disconnecting the optical cables from her temples. "Will she be alright?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "More than alright," Seydou assured him, his earlier urgency giving way to professional confidence.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "She returns to her quarters afterwards," Celine interjected, already moving toward the exit. "Her role is complete."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Ma'am. Ume chose to help us." Jabari said, feeling heat rise to his face. "She deserves better than to be used and discarded."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I agree," Seydou said, surprising everyone. "Besides, Ume may be essential to locating the fragment."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Celine turned, one eyebrow raised. "Explain."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The resonance frequency we extracted—it's not just data, it's a sensory input," Seydou explained, removing his protective goggles. "Ume's systems could be recalibrated to detect it. She could lead us directly to the fragment, even through interference that would blind our instruments."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You're suggesting we bring an android—an Imperial android—on a critical mission to the Far Side?" Celine's skepticism was palpable, her voice rising.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I'm suggesting we utilize every advantage," Seydou countered.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "To some more than others," Wilhelm remarked with a knowing glance at Jabari.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Celine's expression hardened. "This isn't about what an android 'deserves'. It's about mission parameters and security protocols."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Dr. Kamara," Jabari pressed, "She did fight alongside us in Taiwan."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "She's a machine programmed to simulate emotion," Celine replied, an unexpected edge in her voice. "Don't confuse programming with loyalty."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Actually," Seydou interrupted, "11th-generation synthetics like Ume possess advanced neural networks that allow for genuine emotional development. Their consciousness isn't programmed so much as cultivated like those 22nd Century models — "
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Save the technical lecture," Celine cut him off. "I've seen what happens when people anthropomorphize these things. Nothing good comes of it." Her gaze flickered toward Ume's still form.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Before Jabari could respond, a soft sound drew everyone's attention. Ume's eyes had opened, amber irises adjusting to the light as awareness returned to her features.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "How... how long was I offline?" she asked, voice slightly mechanical before self-calibrating to its usual timbre.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Approximately forty-three minutes," Seydou answered, monitoring her vitals on a nearby display. "How do you feel?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Ume's expression shifted through subtle changes as yellow lines of energies danced in her amber irises. "Memory banks fragmented. Some data corrupted. But core systems intact." She turned to Jabari, recognition warming her features. "You stayed."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yeah." he replied simply, nodding.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Ume attempted to rise from the chair, movements stiff at first. Jabari offered his arm for support, which she accepted with a nod of gratitude before her small feet touched the floor.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "We're heading to Zeeman Crater to retrieve a fragment of the Moondust Crystal." Celine stated, watching Ume with undisguised caution.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Crystal," Ume repeated, her expression momentarily distant. "I remember now. The data showed a shard, separated from the main body."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The guy storing the data in you did not want you to have read-write access those partitions. But I've — 'added them back'." Seydou commented eagerly, raising a hand to adjust his goggles. "Any other details you can recall?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Ume lowered her head briefly before turning to Seydou's gaze. "The fragment resonates at a specific frequency. I can... sense it somehow. Like a song I've heard before but can't quite name."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Precisely why she should join us," Seydou declared triumphantly as he turned to Celine. "She's essentially a living detector for the Crystal's signature!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Far Side of Osram isn't exactly a pleasure cruise, though," Wilhelm countered, standing between Jabari and Seydou. "Radi-Mons, magnetic anomalies—not to mention whatever defenses might surround the fragment itself."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I want to help." Ume said quietly but firmly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Celine looked between them, clearly calculating variables and risks. Finally, she sighed. "You have three hours to prepare her for…whatever roles you decide to assign her to." With that, she exited the lab, leaving tension in her wake.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Don't take it personally," Wilhelm told Ume once Celine was gone. "She has... history with Da-Ji models."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I understand," Ume replied.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Thank the Elder Gods she said yes," Seydou moved to a nearby workbench, retrieving something, "This is for you, Ume."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He held out what appeared to be a modified Plasma Handgun. It gleamed with an emerald hue accented by polished gold inlays along its frame and barrel. The upper chamber housed a specialized energy core, visible through small illuminated ports, while featuring a textured grip with the Directorate emblem subtly embedded at the base. Small status indicators glowed softly along its side, and the barrel's aperture was slightly wider than standard models.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Your personal firearm, modified from what Jabari gave you." Seydou explained. "I've made some improvements based on my studies on how androids hold and operate objects like it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Ume accepted the weapon, holding it with unexpected familiarity. "It feels heavier than I remember."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Enhanced stabilization core," Seydou nodded, pride evident in his voice. "But the true modification is the overcharger module. Hold the trigger, and it builds energy for a concentrated blast. Release, and it creates a small explosive impact."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The gun seemed to fit perfectly in Ume's hand, as if designed specifically for her proportions. She examined it with analytical precision, then looked up at Seydou. "Thank you."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Test it in the firing range on Deck F when you get a chance," Seydou suggested. "I've calibrated it to work optimally with your neural processing speeds and targeting algorithms. Uploaded some custom knowledge on weapon usage and field operation into your long-term memory while digging for the Moondust data, too."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari watched this exchange with mixed feelings. On one hand, arming Ume further integrated her into the team. On the other, it suggested Seydou had plans for her beyond simply detecting the Moondust Crystal.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Before he could add to the conversation, Wilhelm called from across the lab. "You all! Prep meeting in thirty minutes. Need to go over Scarab and Anioma deployment protocols for Far Side conditions."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   With a nod of acknowledgment to Wilhelm, Jabari turned back to Ume. "Rest if you need to. Whatever Celine thinks of you, we'll figure something out."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I don't need rest, Jabari," Ume said with unexpected determination. She adjusted her grip on the modified Plasma Handgun as her small lips bloomed into a smile. "I need purpose."
  </span>
