<p class="cnM5NDBkNGVmMjEwOTQzOWE5YzQ5N2MzM2ZmYTJlMTU1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><strong>23:01, February 23, 2295</strong></span></p>
<p class="cnM0NzAyODFjNzAwZTQxNWNhNTBmZGUyZWI0Zjg5ODgw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Zhongshan S Rd, Taipei, Taiwan, Imperium of Dragons territory</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMjUwODVmYTY3OTQ4OWRhYzNmNjNlMGVmMjhiYzE1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As they walked, the night air was chilly despite the approaching spring. Joon-Seok walked beside Dilinur along the hotel's garden pathway, their footsteps creating a rhythm against the stone. Below them, Taipei's cityscape glowed with fusion-powered lights.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTkxM2I0MWMyZTQyZTNhMjA0Yzc0MTkzNGQ0NGZi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The meal was quite revealing," Joon-Seok said quietly. "Food speaks truths that words often conceal."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNGRhNzUzZTJhZDRjZDE5YzQyMzJjODM4ZGZlMGRk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur watched him from the corner of her eye, his features highlighted by a nearby red lantern. "And what truths did you discover about me, Your Highness?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM5M2RlNDAxMGRhNTQ5NTU4ZTc2ODEyN2M2ZWY0Mjll"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">He turned slightly, his profile outlined against the city lights. "That beneath the Imperial Prefect lies a woman who remembers the warmth of her homeland's hearth, even as she serves in palaces of jade and gold."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNDM3NzBiZjM5YzRiOTlhNzQ2ZjVlMTE5ZjExM2Fh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Something stirred in Dilinur's chest—a feeling she'd long suppressed. Her fingers instinctively touched the jade hairpin at the nape of her neck, an old habit she'd never quite broken.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDdmYjcwM2RhYTQxNmY4NmExMTgzNDQwNWJiNjU0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">They walked in silence until they reached the government complex next to the hotel. The doors opened automatically, recognizing Dilinur. The corridor walls displayed holographic murals of Imperial conquests—Taiwan's annexation, the Mars Campaign, the Lunar Incursion—each victory shown in gold and red.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYTUzODhiNzQ0NTQxOTk5NmY1OTUyZTdmMWRkYmE5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"My study is at the end of this passage," Dilinur said. "The specimen is housed there, under my direct supervision as Governor Qin ordered."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMzUzYzJkMmMzNTRkMmFhOTUxZmYwMzg3Zjc0ODQ1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Joon-Seok nodded, looking at a hologram of Eclipse mages defeating Taiwanese fighters, labeled 'February 28, 2277'. "A wise precaution. Biological assets require constant oversight."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMDExODhhNzlhYTQ4NzdiYjhjN2I3YjQwYzNjZjg5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">They reached a mahogany door with jade panels. Dilinur pressed her palm against it, and the door opened silently to reveal her study.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNmU2NTAzMWE1ZDQ4NzU4YzdkNTcyZTFjMTRhYzE2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The room was lit by amber panels in the carved ceiling. Traditional wooden beams crossed overhead, reflecting the warm light. The walls held scrolls and leather-bound books, along with data terminals and holographic displays. A large obsidian desk dominated the center of the room.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMTNmYWRlNGE1ZDQxNzFhYmVkMTlkYTkwYmQ5Yzg5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Please," Dilinur gestured for him to enter.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYThiZWE4ODU4NzQ1ZTI5ZWYwYzdhY2JiYWM1MzM4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Joon-Seok stepped inside, immediately noticing the Genome Sequencer on the eastern wall. Its circular interface glowed with Reikan script scrolling across its surface. The room smelled of sandalwood and ozone.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTdhNDU1YTNjNTRhYmRiNTY2MWFkMGYwYTQyYzE1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Your collection of texts is remarkable," Joon-Seok observed, noting "The Art of War" beside data crystals. "Sun Tzu alongside quantum theories... and is that the forbidden 'Necromicon of Chang'?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZDNjODU3M2ExNzQ4MzA4ZWY2OTI2NDc5ZWRmNTUy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Different perspectives on power," Dilinur replied, pleased by his recognition. "I find wisdom in understanding how various minds approach the same questions."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZWU5ODFjMGNhMTQ5YjBiMDllZDBjNjQxZWNlZDFj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She moved toward the Sequencer and activated it. The interface expanded into a holographic display as panels shifted on the wall, revealing a large cylindrical chamber.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZDg2YTRmYjRmOTRjNWVhYWRiNmE2MzBjNjRiM2Q0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Genome Sequencer, display Flesh Pot current status," Dilinur commanded.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOTBmZjg4Y2JmYjRkZjliYThhZmExMzM4NTY2ZWU2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Displaying Tissue Culture Container contents. Development progress: 93% complete," the machine responded in a neutral female voice.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTJhY2M1ZDg3YjQ5ZTI4MGZmOTdhMWE1YjMyMmYx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The chamber lit up, showing Flesh Pot suspended in amber fluid. Nearly three meters tall, it had raw red skin covered in overlapping plates like armor. Its massive head hung forward with eyes closed, but its mouth—rings of teeth—was partly open. Its multiple limbs ended in sharp claws that occasionally twitched. Tubes connected to its back, feeding it nutrients and genetic material.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOWNiMTVjZjZlODQ2ZTViYmZiMGM0MjFhMWIyOGY4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Joon-Seok stepped closer, looking fascinated rather than disgusted. "Extraordinary," he said, studying the creature. "The integration of the donor materials is seamless. Your design?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM5M2U1NjgwNWE0OTQyOTZhNTBiMzVmMjliZjE2ZmIw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yes," Dilinur admitted, unable to hide her pride. "The basic template was mine, though the Sequencer handled the genetic recombination."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2M2MyMjkyMDQ1NTQ3ZWM4YWIwYjM4YzVhNTZjNTI3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"And the human contributors?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NDg3NTJhNjIxYjRiOWE4OGRhYmNjZGI0MGQ2Yjlm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Traitors. Rebels." She answered automatically, then added, "Their genetic structures were compatible with the mutations we wanted to develop."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZDU4ZjA4ZjE2NjRjNGE4NTRhNTg0YWIwMDUyMWU0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I see," he said neutrally.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNGUzOWZkYzAxYjQ2YTg4YmU3N2ZjZjc1NjdhNDBm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur pointed to a control panel beside the container. "Once awakened, Flesh Pot responds primarily to my commands through a psionic link established during its formation. The neural pathways—"</span></p><span class="cjc3ZDQ5NjJlNDIxMjQwYmNiMzQ5YmI3OTllM2Y4NzRi"><br/>This novel's true home is a different platform. Support the author by finding it there.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNmZTBlNjM5N2E2YTQ5ZDQ5MDE4NjM1NTQyMDAwMWZi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A sharp alert from her desk interrupted her. She quickly moved to check the holographic message. "Forgive me, Your Highness. A security alert from the lower levels requiring immediate attention."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Y2VjMTIyOGMzYTQ2NzNhZjRmMjU2MDI0YmE2MTMx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">While she dealt with the notification, Joon-Seok explored her study. He walked beyond the Sequencer to a partially hidden alcove behind a folding screen with dragons and phoenixes. There, a smaller but equally sophisticated device hummed, its cylinder also filled with amber fluid.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYjA3ZDBkZjU1YzQ0OGNiOTdjN2M3YTVjMzgxYjdk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur felt her heart race when she turned and saw him standing before Skarn's tentacle. The severed limb—black and thick like a muscular worm, nearly arm-length—floated in suspension. New cells were visibly forming at its cut end, reaching outward.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMmE4NWI3YmY3YTQ0YWJhOTBkMTcwN2NkOThlY2Jk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Fascinating," Joon-Seok said carefully. "This appears to be Draug tissue. Alpha-class, if I'm not mistaken." His finger hovered near the glass, tracing the tentacle without touching it. "The regenerative capabilities are... remarkable."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OTQwNDU2ODI5ZDQyYTA5OGJlYTg1MGM5MDMzYzJh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur crossed the room quickly, thinking of possible explanations.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZmRjODlhZTgyNzQ3NWY5OTUzNTgwODQ4ZjFiZjA0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Subject S," Joon-Seok continued, "The Primarch who escaped from Amber Moon Spire."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZjRhNGQ4MjRkZDRiYzdhNzdiNDkyMGFjZjRiOTc0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Your Highness—" Dilinur began tensely.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MTQ5M2MxNTljYTQ2YzQ4NjVhYzQ5Y2Y5NDk5OGNl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The cellular structure is unique," he continued as if he hadn't heard her, studying the tissue analytically. "Unlike any Radi-Mon specimen I've examined. The chromosomal configuration suggests advanced adaptive capabilities." He looked up at her directly. "You're attempting to grow your own, aren't you?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NDRiNDRjNWVmODQ0NGU4OWFjMTgzNjNiYmJiMzdh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The accusation hung between them, but he sounded more curious than condemning. Dilinur made a split-second decision based on instinct rather than calculation.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NmQ4YWVlMzI3ODQxY2JiZjY2YTUzMWRiYWUxNGM0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yes," she admitted, stepping closer to the container. The tentacle pulsed, as if responding to her. "A controlled replication. If successful, it would create a being with Skarn's capabilities but without his connection to the Hivemind."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNGE1YjA1YTAzYTRlMDQ4NDlhNGQ0ODQ0Nzk5Yzdl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Controlled by you," Joon-Seok stated.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYmIzZjc4ODI0NTQxMWE5YTg3ZjhiNTcwMTI5YTJk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"If we claim the Moondust Crystal, yes." She held his gaze.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZjkwZTMyMmYxNTRlYTk5MWFmZjM0ZWFmM2I1ZDZl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"And does Governor Qin know?" he asked gently, almost sympathetically.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNGI4MDc0NGVjMDQyMzRhMDAwNmFiMmJkZWMwMjUx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur's silence answered for her.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOWIzN2I1ZWQ5MTQ1MmU5OTA5NDBjMWVmMzkyM2Mw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">To her surprise, Joon-Seok turned back to the container with renewed interest. "The cellular division is extraordinarily stable," he observed professionally. "You've solved the degradation issues that plagued similar experiments in Choson's labs for years."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDk0ZTdiZWM1MDQwMWFiOWQwYzA0ZjhiOTFjNDk2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur found herself trembling. "You're not... disturbed by this unauthorized project?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMjFhY2E5Y2Q3MTRmZGQ5NDg3YjE5MGFmOTgxMGZh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Disturbed?" A small smile appeared on his lips. "The Imperium has always advanced through the bold actions of those willing to venture where others dare not tread." His gaze followed the developing mass in the container. "History remembers the visionaries, not the rule-followers."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MzA4NmZkMjc4YjRhMjliYTBhZjdhNDg2NGRlZjFk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">He stepped away from the container and faced her directly. In the amber light, his features seemed warmer. "Your secret is safe, Dinu. May I call you Dinu when we're alone?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOGVmMmY3MWVlMTQ1Y2E4NjNmMzgyNGEzZDVjY2Jj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The informal address—and its intimacy—surprised her. "Yes, of course, Your—"</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZjgyOTk2Y2I5YjQ5NGNiZDI1NmJmNjNkMDY1MGRk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Joon-Seok," he corrected gently. "If we're to share confidences."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNTYwZGM3NmJlZTQ2Y2E4ZDZkOWY4ZThhNzEzM2Qy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur nodded, feeling strangely light. "Why would you protect my secret? You could gain considerable favor with the Emperor with this knowledge."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYjRhNmI5NWVjNTQ3YWViMTFiNmFiZGExYjNmYWRl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Joon-Seok held her gaze before reaching into his robe. He pulled out a small object that caught the light—a crystal vial containing what looked like quicksilver, but which moved with unnatural awareness. Tiny characters were etched into the crystal's surface, shifting as the contents pulsed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZWE4NDI2MmE1OTQ5ZmM5MjBhOWY2YjRiYTE4MzY3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Blood Rain Aria," he said quietly. "The first half of an Ordovox incantation forbidden since the Svalbard Concordat. It amplifies Eclipse spells beyond natural limits, but costs the caster."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MTQzODE1NmY5MzRiNjBiNGM5NTdmYzAxZDgxZDBh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Emperor ordered all copies destroyed," Dilinur said, amazed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZjNiN2YwYmYyNTRmOWY5NTc0OWYyMjgxZDA2MmNj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yes, he did. Yet here we are." Joon-Seok put the vial back in his robe. "Luckily, few know the chant. Even fewer would recognize if I cast it."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Nzk5MDY0MWJkZjRjY2I5NjA4Mjc0ZTlkZTY5NTRi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The implication was clear—they both had secrets, creating an unexpected bond.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MWNiMDIyZjExNDQxM2Q4ODA5YmNkMjEzZTQwMTBj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"It seems we understand each other better than either might have expected," Dilinur said softly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYjdhMTc0MWYyOTQxYmU5OWU2YjEwNWQ5MTIxNWUx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Indeed." Joon-Seok moved closer, making her highly aware of his presence. "I recognize in you a kindred spirit, Dilinur. Someone who sees beyond the constraints of the present to what might be possible."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYTk3NTM5NDEyMzQ4MTRiNTFiM2NiN2IxMGVmYmZh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Behind them, Flesh Pot shifted slightly in its amber prison. The tentacle in the smaller chamber pulsed in response, as if acknowledging a distant sibling.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NWI0MmY4ZGEyYjRlMjQ4MDY0MWY0ZDNjNDgwZGFl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I can help you with this project," Joon-Seok offered, gesturing toward the specimen. "Choson maintains certain research facilities that operate... outside standard Imperial oversight."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MzUyYmZiODQ2NjQ5M2NhNTU4MmI5NzNlZmRjMGI2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"And what would you ask in return?" Dilinur asked, knowing from years in Imperial politics that all offers had conditions.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZDY3OWFhYTQwOTQ0MTFhMmJjZTI1YWI0NTZhMDRj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Nothing immediately," he replied honestly. "But perhaps, when the time comes, you'll remember who stood beside you when others would have condemned your vision."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDNjMzI2MDYzZjRlMTY4NmRlNzRlMzAwNWVmYWQ4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The proposition was clear in its ambiguity—an alliance that might matter in a future neither could fully predict.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNDNlMzMyOTk5ZDRkOWNhOGQ5OTM1YzQ1MGQzMDQy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I would welcome your assistance," Dilinur said carefully. "And your discretion."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NTMwZWRhZTg0NzQ0YjI5MzhiODRkY2IxYTBiYjNh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Joon-Seok nodded thoughtfully. "Have you chosen a name for it yet? Your creation?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ODcxNDdiYmM0NTRlNmM5NGEyODk1ZTg3M2E5MjAy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The question surprised her. "I hadn't considered..."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YWJkNjM1Y2NhZTRlZDI5MDAxN2VhZWQyMmYxNTk2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Names have power," he said, moving toward the door.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNjc0OTZkNWNlMzQ2ZjQ5Njg2MmRkNzExMTc3M2Ri"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As he reached the doorway, he turned back. The amber light caught his profile, half in shadow, half illuminated. "Until tomorrow, Dilinur. I look forward to our journey to Osram."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOGY1OTRiYmI3MjQwNGM5NDk1ZDkxN2Q0NmYwNzg4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Until tomorrow," she echoed.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMmViODA3MjAyYjQwYmM4NzMyYWQyODJhYWIyM2Nk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The door closed behind him, leaving Dilinur standing between her creations—the monstrous Flesh Pot and the developing tentacle. For the first time in years, she felt something beyond careful survival calculations.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDFiMjkzYTBmZTQyNTc4OTViYzE5ZTE4MjkxOGE5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">In their amber chambers, Flesh Pot's mouth appeared to twitch in a grotesque smile, while the tentacle curled slightly, as if sensing the shift in its creator's fortunes.</span></p>
