<p class="cnNjZGY0MzA0NDgxNTQ5YWU4MWEzYzhkYTJmNTE4Y2Rl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo gawked. Commander had huge, intimidating wings, like an eagle's, and they were mismatched, the right one black and the left a yellow that was almost, but not quite, golden. Even in the midst of battle, even with adrenaline singing through his veins, the sight struck him with profound wrongness. Those wings belonged on something ancient and terrible, not on the man who had taught him to tie his boots and read tactical maps.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYTE5MTkxOWY1NjQwZDRiZjljNDlmZWI5NmFlMzA3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Sakurai tilted his head at Commander, raising an eyebrow with the casual curiosity of someone examining an interesting insect. "I don't believe we've met." There was a pause, during which Commander merely stood his ground, wings spread wide enough to blot out the stars. Then the ice angel's dark eyes widened. "Impossible. How old </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">are</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> you? Why haven't I ever-" He cut himself off, shaking his head. "It doesn't matter."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMTY1ZTQzN2ZhYjRjMGVhOGJkMWJhYjE5NjMzYmUw"><span style="font-weight: 400">A burst of power exploded from Sakurai, strong enough that even Vertigo could feel it pressing against his bones. The air shimmered with supernatural cold, and seconds later winged shapes began materializing in the air behind him. Commander moved faster than thought. One moment he stood twenty feet away, the next his hand was on Vertigo's shoulder while he scooped up Kaelan's unconscious form like she weighed nothing. The world lurched sideways, reality folding in on itself with a sensation like falling upward through ice water.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYThkZDdkMWIxOTQyYjg4ODE3MWJhMTkzZTljM2Fj"><span style="font-weight: 400">When it stopped, they were somewhere else entirely. A barren hilltop under different stars, the air cleaner but thinner, touched with the metallic taste of high altitude. Vertigo's stomach rebelled violently and he dropped to his knees, dry heaving as his inner ear tried to make sense of what had just happened. Teleportation, he realized dimly. Commander could fucking teleport.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YjRkYzJkNDg5NDRjMGI4YjIzZDE3YjE0ZGVmMzYw"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Get her out of here." Commander's voice was already moving away as he laid his hands over Kaelan, golden light flowing from his palms into her still form. The healing energy was warm, familiar. Vertigo had felt it before when Commander patched him up after particularly brutal training sessions. "Find someplace safe. Tell her I'll meet her when this is over. I might be away for a while."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNzQzNTFiN2Y2NDRjNmZhOWQyMThjNTdmM2ZjZDBl"><span style="font-weight: 400">The casual way he said it - </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">might be away for a while</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> - sent ice through Vertigo's veins. Not the supernatural cold of Sakurai's power, but the deeper chill of abandonment, of being left behind by the only constant in his chaotic life.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYTZjY2QwZmE5YjRmY2Y5MDZmMTJjNjcwYTI0ODMw"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Wait, what are you going to-"</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYzE3ZDk1ZGZhMTRiZjc4MzkxOWJhMmU4YjkxZThj"><span style="font-weight: 400">"I'm going to go back and take care of those angels." Commander took a few steps away from Kaelan, staring into the star-filled sky. His wings flared without conscious direction, seeming to have a mind of their own, feathers ruffling in a wind that touched nothing else. "I assume those Talents I sensed means you succeeded in your mission."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMTYzYTkzY2MzOTRiMmY5ZWUwMmE2NGNmYzU3YzY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">The comment was so typically Commander, focused on the tactical situation even while preparing to face down a small army of hostile angels, that Vertigo felt something break loose in his chest. This was really happening. Commander was really going to leave him. "Despite what you might believe, Vertigo," Commander continued, his voice gentling in a way that made everything worse, "I've always had your best interests in mind. Trust Kaelan. She has a good heart, even if she's shit at showing it. Take care of everyone while I'm gone."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NThlNzk1MmI5MjRkMzU5MDUyZjNhMDRjZWQzNDNm"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Take care of everyone.</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> As if Vertigo had any idea how to hold together a mercenary corps that looked to Commander for everything from tactical guidance to fatherly advice. As if he could fill boots that had been walking these wasteland paths for longer than he had existed. "Fuck that, I'm going with you." Vertigo scrambled to his feet, reaching toward Commander with desperate hands. "I can fight, you know I can. Whatever this is, we handle it together. That's how it works."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YmFjY2Y2MTk0MzQ0ODk4YzI0Zjk1MDAwOWE4MjE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Commander shoved him roughly in the direction of Kaelan's still form, and the rejection stung worse than the physical hit. "No. Take her and let me deal with it."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NzJkMTM1NmU4MjQxOGE5NTZmNDQ2YTBkOWJjNDg0"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Why?" The word came out broken, younger than Vertigo had sounded in years. "Why can't Iâ€¦ why won't you let me help you?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Yjk3NzFkNTRjYjRlNzNiZTg2MmZkNzk2MTMyYzBk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Commander didn't answer, turning away, and as Vertigo stared at him, those massive feathered wings blotting out the stars, the rigid set of shoulders that had carried more burdens than any one being should bear, memory struck like lightning. His conversation with Argent about wings, her casual comment that had seemed meaningless at the time: </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Demons never get feathery wings.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnMyZGZiZjA5NTM0MDQwZTE4YjViODFkODYxZDgwMWNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">The implications crashed over him in waves. Commander was an angel. Had always been an angel. Every lesson, every moment of guidance, every scrap of affection or approval, all of it came from one of the creatures who saw him and his kind as enemies. Vertigo hesitated, paralyzed by the weight of revelation and betrayal, and Commander's patience finally snapped.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZDZkMmQ1NDRjODRjZDdhN2NjZDhhOTMzZTYxMGY1"><span style="font-weight: 400">"GO!" The command carried supernatural force, like a hand pressing against Vertigo's will. Commander disappeared between one heartbeat and the next, leaving only the fading scent of ozone and the whisper of displaced air.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzM2I2NDFhYTcxMTQ5NTRiYTc5OTA3ZDc2ZDljYWM0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaelan was still where Commander had left her, unconscious and vulnerable in a way that sat wrong with everything Vertigo knew about her. He knelt beside her, studying the peaceful expression that made her look younger, less sharp-edged. It was the first time he'd seen her face without the armor of constant vigilance.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNTk3ZWIyMWVjYTQ0OWJhODkxMDM5MzM1NmRiZGJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Hey." Left without any other option, he shook her shoulder gently. "Hey you." No response. "Fuck. I bet you're just pretending so I have to carry you, aren't you?" Silence. He sighed, the sound heavy with exhaustion that went bone-deep. Everything hurt; his body from the fight, his head from the teleportation, his chest from Commander's casual abandonment.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDM0M2M3ZjI1OTQyZjI4YzVlYzFiOWIyMWFiNDk0"><span style="font-weight: 400">He started to sheathe his sword onto his back so he could have his hands free to pick her up, when he realized there was a problem. Kaelan's wings had vanished when she lost consciousness, dissolving into whatever otherworldly space angels kept their inhuman appendages. Vertigo's wings, however, were still there, still fluttering behind him like restless thoughts made manifest. "Oh shit. How do I turn it off?" He thought about it for a moment, trying to recall how Kaelan made hers appear and disappear. It seemed effortless when she did it, as natural as breathing. "Wings go away?" Still there. "How the fuck do I make them go away if I don't know how I made them appear in the first place?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNjllZWFlOGQ1YTQzNzViYWUzMjZlNTJlNjIxYTAy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe if he just sort of willed them to disappear, they would. That was how Kaelan seemed to do it, a moment of focus, a subtle shift in posture, and then the transformation. He closed his eyes, trying to feel his way back to the moment they'd emerged. The memory was chaos and pain and desperation, hardly a reliable guide. He focused on his shoulder blades, searching for the point where flesh became something else. The wings twitched in response to his attention, sending unfamiliar sensations along nerve pathways that shouldn't exist.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNzBiYjg4NzdkODQxYjE4ZDQ4OTVhOGFmNjNhMjEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Gradually, he began to envision them shrinking, compacting, sliding back into his skin as though they'd never been. The process felt like undoing a knot in reverse, unraveling something that had been wound tight. A painful pop jolted him out of his concentration, followed by the warm trickle of blood down his back. "Fuck," he swore, reaching behind to grab at where the wings had been. They weren't there anymore. His probing fingers found only two tender lacerations where the appendages had torn through skin and muscle. "I guess that works." He bent and scooped Kaelan into his arms, grunting at her weight. She was taller than most women and solid with muscle. "Goddamn, you're heavy." </span></p>
<p class="cnM1Y2M5NmMxZmJmYTRhNTY5NDNiM2QyNzFkNmNhZDZh"><span style="font-weight: 400">No response. Her head lolled against his shoulder, silver hair spilling across his arm like liquid moonlight. Up close, he could see the faint lines around her eyes, evidence of years and experiences he couldn't imagine. How old was she? Centuries? Millennia? He remembered the last time heâ€™d carried her unconscious form. Millennia might well have passed since then for everything that had changed.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYzY0YzE4YTczZTRkMzU5Y2JkNDI2Y2VkOTc4Njlk"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Fuck," he said again, more quietly this time. The word carried all his frustration, confusion, and bone-deep weariness.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NGNhYmNiYTU3MzQ3OWU4ZTViZWY3M2Y1ZWIxMjk0"><span style="font-weight: 400">After a while, as he picked his way down the mountainside with his unconscious burden, he sent out a tentative mental thread. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">::Commander?::</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> The psychic touch felt thin and desperate in the vast emptiness around them. There was no response, not even the faint sense of presence that usually accompanied Commander's mental voice. Either he was too far away, too busy fighting for his life, orâ€¦ Vertigo bit his lip and kept walking, trying not to think about what else might account for the silence.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZWU3ZDY2YThhNzRjNWJhMzExZTk1ZjAxZTRhMTI5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually they made it back to civilization, a border town whose name he didn't know and didn't care to learn. Vertigo's arms and back were beginning to ache seriously by the time he spotted the first inn, so he went for it without bothering to scout alternatives. The girl running the place gave them a strange look, and well she might. Vertigo was covered in blood and carrying in an unconscious silver-haired woman who looked like she'd stepped out of a storybook. But she was wise enough not to ask questions of armed strangers with coin to pay.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZDZlMjUwMDQ0NTRmNDJiZDhjMDkwMmMzZDljNjk2"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Room," he said simply, too tired for politeness.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MDIwOGQ3Y2M4ZDQyYjc5ZmVmNzEyMDA3YjY2MWEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">"One or two?" she asked, eyeing Kaelan's limp form.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NzA1Y2M5ODhlYjRkNTlhODEyM2Y3N2IwZjQ4MDRk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo opened his mouth to say two, then caught himself. He had no idea how long she'd be unconscious, and no idea what might come looking for them. "One. And a bath."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYmE4NzUwNzMxYzQzNGQ5NWUwNzc1Y2FiNzVkOWRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">With a sigh of relief he dumped Kaelan onto the bed. Kaelan shifted and made a small noise, as though coming awake, and for a moment hope flared in his chest. "Aw, the sleeping princess awakes. And I didn't even get to give her a kiss," he said sarcastically, but she only moved slightly and fell back into quiescence. The joke felt flat, wrong somehow. Nothing about this situation was funny.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MThjODhiYjdkNjQwMDFhMDI3NjU0OTdmNzYyYzBi"><span style="font-weight: 400">He poked his head into the bathroom and saw that there was indeed a god - there was a good-sized bathtub available, and it looked clean. The luxury was unexpected in a place like this, but he wasn't about to question good fortune. Setting a chair against the door to hold it shut, he stripped down, tossing his clothes on the floor as he filled the tub with water as hot as he could stand. His shirt was starting to look pretty ragged, especially in the back where the wings had ripped through it, but there was really no help for that. His whole wardrobe was going to need replacing soon.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ODBhMjMxODhlYTQwNWVhNjZkM2QyMjcyYWRkZjY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Stepping into the hot water, he sighed as heat soaked into abused muscles. Then he gasped as the water contacted the various cuts and scrapes covering his body, as well as the two larger wounds on his shoulders. Dust and dirt floated out in a dark cloud around him, evidence of how thoroughly he'd been through the wringer.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMmJjZWY0NjE2NjQxZjNiNjZmZmJjOWFkODQyZGFh"><span style="font-weight: 400">He washed mechanically, paying careful attention to the wing wounds. They were already closing up, the edges pink and healthy. He had faster healing than any normal human, but these were healing quickly even for him. The realization brought another unwelcome thought: Now that he thought about it, he remembered seeing scars in those exact spots on Commander's back. But Commander's torso was such a roadmap of old wounds that he hadn't thought it significant at the time.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YWRhYzk2ZjZjZDQxOTFhNTExNjc2MmRkYzc2ZGZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">How many secrets had been hiding in plain sight? How many clues had he missed because he'd trusted Commander implicitly?</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MzVhNTBkOWI0NDQxZjE4ZWRmYjhmNjE5OTYyMTQ4"><span style="font-weight: 400">The thought of Commander sent what he supposed was his human half into emotional free fall; a tightness in the throat and a burning behind his eyes that he refused to acknowledge. He tipped his head back against the side of the tub, letting the ends of his hair drag in the water, and closed his eyes. Told his human half to take a hike. Much as it felt like abandonment, Commander hadn't left him to die. There had to be a reason for the secrecy, a purpose behind the deception. Commander always had reasons, layers of strategy that only became clear in retrospect.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMzU2ZDFjNGEzMDQ2NjRhNGE5ZTcyMjVmODI5ZDg4"><span style="font-weight: 400">But he couldn't quite suppress the hurt entirely. What would they do without Commander? Even if it was only temporary, Vertigo didn't think the corps would hold together well in his absence. Who would make the hard decisions? Who would keep Bliss and Nathan from killing each other during planning sessions? Who would...</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OTE0ZjQ2ZDBiODQ0NTk5MTE4N2I1MmNiOTJhMmQz"><span style="font-weight: 400">A noise from the other room interrupted his spiral of worry. It sounded like Kaelan was awake and moving around. Sighing, he stood and sluiced the last of the grime from his body before stepping out. It felt counterproductive to put on his dirty clothes again when he'd just gotten clean, but he really had no other choice. The blood would come out eventually, and the tears could be mended.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4M2QxZTg3MTNmNzQ5MzZiN2IyY2JjZWM1Yjg2ODM5"><span style="font-weight: 400">He dried himself off with the thick, fluffy towel provided and pulled on his clothes but left his boots off. After unblocking the door, he opened it and stepped through into the main room.</span></p><span class="cjkzMDRmZTI3ZGQ2NzQ3NzE4NGQ5OTIzYTlkNGNlMTcw"><br/>Ensure your favorite authors get the support they deserve.

<p class="cnMyMTJjYmJlN2ViZTQxNjRhNGQ2NGFiYzhkZDkyYzJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaelan sat on the edge of the bed, fully awake and aware. Her silver hair fell loose around her shoulders, still mussed from unconsciousness, and her clothes were wrinkled. But her posture was alert, guarded, back to her normal state of vigilant readiness. Vertigo was overcome with a rush of anger so intense that he was sure his eyes were glowing red again. The fury came from nowhere and everywhere at once, a storm of emotion that had been building all day and finally found its target.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYzdiNGI1YmJiMTQxNDc4NzViMjczMWM1MDgxNGY2"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was because of her that Argent was dead. Because of her alliance, her mission, her precious angelic war that had nothing to do with him. Commander was walking away from everyone - from </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">him</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> - all for her. She had dropped into his life like a fucking meteor and destroyed everything he'd built, everything he'd believed about himself and his place in the world. And she hated his guts on top of it all, looked at him like he was some kind of dirt she couldn't wait to scrub off.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMmZlMTBhNTljYzQwMTBhZWViY2EzZWEwNjBlNjE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">He was tempted to grab her by the throat and shake her until some of his pain leaked out through her broken bones. Instead, he remembered Commander's last order and went to the window. Clutching the curtains in the death grip he wanted to perform on Kaelan, he cursed Commander thoroughly and inventively.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZWQ5NWNjZTEyZDRhNDNhZjQ2NDFmMjRkMTVmYTUx"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Vertigo..." Her voice was soft, and for the first time held a note of uncertainty that he'd never heard before. As if she wasn't entirely sure of her welcome or her safety.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYzZiNGJjMGE0MzRkMjU5MGM3Njk5MzY4MTZjYTRj"><span style="font-weight: 400">"So you're calling me by my name now, huh?" He couldn't keep the bitterness out of his voice. The words tasted like acid. "No more 'half-breed' or 'hey you' or whatever other charming endearments you've been using."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NGRhODdkMjQwMDQxNzM5YjYzMzZjZTFjM2JjN2Mz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaelan hesitated, and he could feel her watching him in the window's reflection. Her silver eyes were unreadable, but her hands were clasped tightly in her lap, a tell he was learning to recognize. "What happened after I lost consciousness?" she asked quietly. "How did we escape?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZmJhYmMxYWI2MDQ0YzZiYzg1NGMzZGRmOTNhNmMy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo's jaw tightened, the memory still raw. "Commander happened," he said flatly, not turning around. "Sakurai was about to finish me off, had an ice spear aimed right at my chest. I thought I was dead." He made a vague gesture with his hands, struggling to describe something that defied description. "Then suddenly Commander was just... there. With wings." The words came out strangled. "Huge feathered wings. One black, one yellow."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZjBiYWQ5YWNmYTRiYjU4NWZhMzZhZTlhYTQ0YTc1"><span style="font-weight: 400">The silence stretched between them, heavy with implications. Finally, Kaelan spoke, her voice carefully neutral. "I'm sorry about Argent. Sakurai would have killed her no matter what happened with Jaeli. Once he was involved, her fate was sealed."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNzM2ZmY5NDBjYjQwYjdiZGFhMTBiZDQzNjEwZGRk"><span style="font-weight: 400">"But you didn't care, did you?" The accusation burst out of him like poison from a lanced wound. "She wasn't useful to you. She wasn't on your side in whatever fucked-up angelic politics you're playing. Her life wasn't worth risking yourself to save."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3M2EzMzhhMjAyYTRmMWQ4YjkxNDI3MmQ2YWJlYjE3"><span style="font-weight: 400">"I didn't want her to die-"</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Mjg3YTQ0MGI5NzRiMGJhNjUyMTVmMGI1NzQ0MzM3"><span style="font-weight: 400">"But you didn't try to save her, did you?" He finally turned around, and the pain in his eyes made her flinch. "You calculated the odds and decided she was acceptable losses. Just like every other angel, just like Commander. Everything's a game to you people, and the rest of us are just pieces to be moved around the board."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTIyZDllNDRkMDQ3NTI5MjBhY2M5NmY0NWY4MjQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaelan opened her mouth as if to argue, then closed it again. What could she say? The quiet stretched between them, a chasm that seemed impossible to bridge. Vertigo turned back to the window, unable to look at her anymore. The rain had started again, droplets streaking down the glass like tears.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMmRhNWFkYzkyZjRjMzQ4Y2VhZjU4YmU2MGQxNDc4"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Commander's one of you," he said eventually, still staring out at the night. He could hear her sharp intake of breath, but didn't turn around. "I know. He didn't tell me, but I figured it out."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNjVhNGJmY2NiNTQxOWU5MDdlMGE3MzY0NTk3N2Qy"><span style="font-weight: 400">"How?" Her voice was barely above a whisper.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZDljODcwNTQzZTQyZWQ4MWVhNjVkZmMyZDk1MDUy"><span style="font-weight: 400">"The wings." Vertigo's mouth twisted into something that wasn't quite a smile. "Argent told me that demons never have feathery wings."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZmNlODVhYTNlMjRjNzU4Zjk5ZjMwYTIwOGRmNDQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Ah." Kaelan nodded slowly, though he couldn't see it. "Commander is... complicated. Even among angelkind."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NDg5MGQ2YjlhNDRlY2RiYjg0ZDc4Njk3YjI2MzMx"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Clearly," Vertigo said dryly. "Fifteen years. Fifteen fucking years he's been training me, teaching me, and he never once thought to mention that little detail. 'Oh, by the way, kid, I'm one of the immortal beings you're supposedly descended from. Also, I've been lying to you about literally everything.' " The bitterness in his voice could have stripped paint.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NjNjMTk4ZDlhYTQxOTFiY2I0ZmIzZmYzNDMwYmI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">"He had his reasons, I'm sure." Kaelan's voice was carefully neutral, but Vertigo could sense there was more she wasn't saying. "Commander doesn't do anything without purpose."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOGEyYTRmNDU3NTQyYzhiZjBkMTllYWQyYjdlNWY4"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Yeah, I'm starting to figure that out." Vertigo pressed his forehead against the cool glass, watching his breath fog the surface. "Makes me wonder what his purpose was with me. Was I just another weapon to be sharpened? Another tool for his collection?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZjM4NDlkNzAyYjRjYTY5YTIwMGUwMTEzNDk2OTBk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Silence reigned for several more minutes, broken only by the drumming of rain against the window and the distant sounds of the inn settling for the night. Then, unexpectedly, Kaelan spoke. "Thank you." The words sounded like they'd been pulled from her by force.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYmRjMzUwZjE2NDQ5MWZhYzQxOTk3YmE2YTQzOTE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">He blinked, surprised but not willing to show it. "For what?" he asked guardedly, still not turning around.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjAwNTcxNWM0YTRmYjlhMzNjZDUyNmRlMjFhMmE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">"For fighting with me. For bringing me here safely. For..." She paused, seeming to struggle with the words. "For not leaving me for Sakurai when you could have. I know you didn't have to do any of it. I know what you think of me, and maybe you're right. But I wanted you to know that I understand what it cost you."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OGFiZGM4ZDdlODQ5MGQ5Zjc0NmRhOTgzMjRkMDlj"><span style="font-weight: 400">The acknowledgment hit him harder than he'd expected. Some of the anger drained out of him, leaving behind only exhaustion and confusion. "Commander told me to keep you safe," he said gruffly, deflecting the gratitude he didn't know how to handle.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YzUwNzZmYjQ5ZTQxNjc5Y2QwMzNmZGFkN2UxOGM5"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Even before then," she pointed out quietly. "You didn't have to help me fight Sakurai. You could have grabbed those people and run. Let us kill each other and been done with both problems."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMjkzN2UzZjdiMTRkMjk4OTA5ZDlhZjIyMGE2Y2U0"><span style="font-weight: 400">The words forced him to confront something he'd been avoiding; the fact that somewhere along the way, his feelings about Kaelan had become complicated. She was still arrogant, still infuriating, still looked at him like he was something scraped off her boot. But she was also brave and competent and willing to put herself between innocent people and danger. And underneath all that angelic superiority, he'd glimpsed something that might have been vulnerability.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYmEyZDBhOWUzODQ4MGU5OTdlZTNjZjcwNjFiNzE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">He bared his teeth, wishing she would shut up and stop talking. She was making everything even more awkward and uncomfortable than it already was. He hated being thanked for things; he just did them because they needed doing. Resentment welled up inside him once more, a familiar shield against emotions he didn't want to examine. "Forget it. And I mean that." He crossed his arms, unwilling to listen to anything else she had to say. "We don't need to make this into some kind of moment."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZjI0ZDE3MTY4NzQ1NDFhMTZhZjE3YjA5OTY4N2Yz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Silence descended again, heavier than before. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlMGI1YjZjNzBiZTQxMmQ4MmJlMTdiYWI3MWNjNTk3"><span style="font-weight: 400">"I should go back," she said quietly. "To the angelic realm."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZjQxNWE3NmRiNjQ1Mzc4MzI1Y2U1MTM1ZDljM2I1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo stiffened as though she'd driven a blade between his ribs. Another abandonment. Another person walking away just when he'd started to... what? Trust her? The thought was ridiculous, but the pain was real enough. "Of course you should," he said, his voice flat with forced indifference. "Back to get Commander involved in your stupid little war. Use him up like you used up Argent, like you're planning to use up everyone else."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZWFjZTY0MTIwMTRjZDk4YmU2NjVmMTIzMjU3ZjI5"><span style="font-weight: 400">"The stupid little war that's going to save the lives of everyone on this realm, yours included!" Her voice rose, sparked by his casual dismissal of everything she'd been fighting for.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZmIxNzFjNzZmODRhNGE5ZGFkYTEzOTIzOTVlNzhh"><span style="font-weight: 400">The anger was back, burning through him like wildfire. "You can't just drop in, fuck up my life all to hell, then waltz back out without leaving me </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">something</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">!" The words exploded out of him, raw and desperate. "There's obviously a whole other side to fighting that I've been missing all this time. Power, real power, not just the parlor tricks Commander taught me. I want it. I need it." He turned around finally, facing her fully, and she could see the desperation behind his anger. "You're taking Commander away from us for who knows how long. Someone's got to lead the corps, and it's probably going to end up being me. I don't have the strength to hold us together. Nathan's ambitious, Bliss is unpredictable, and half the rank and file barely tolerate me on a good day. Without Commander's authority backing me up, they'll tear each other apart inside of a month."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNWI4MTgzZjkwODQxMWNhMmFmMGFjZjUxZTZmOWYy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaelan rounded on him, eyes flashing with indignation. "First of all, it was your Commander's choice to come to our aid. I had nothing to do with it, he offered help in exchange for me working with </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">you</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Which I've already done. Secondly, do you have any conception of how long it takes to train a novice in magic? We don't die like humans do; we have ages to learn things properly." She stood up, beginning to pace, her agitation visible in every line of her body. "I admit that you're slightly better off than a pure human. You'll live longer, heal faster, and it's possible that you might eventually approach something resembling the power of a full-blooded </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">demonai</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. But it would take timeâ€¦ decades, maybe centuries, and that's time I don't have to spare. I have to figure out how to stop Kaldi from doing something that everyone's going to regret."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZWViMjA0MmI3YjRhNjlhZGIzYzAyZmFiOTM2ZmQz"><span style="font-weight: 400">She held up a third finger, ticking off her points like a lecturer addressing a particularly slow student. "Third, if you go casually throwing around the kind of power you manifested during that fight, someone's going to take notice. Someone's going to see a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">demonai</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> half-breed wielding destruction, and they're going to send a hunter after you. And that'll be that." The clinical way she said it, as if his death would be just another unfortunate but predictable outcome, sent his rage boiling over.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYTMwNTQ0M2I0NDQxMmRiYzMxYzI2NDY2N2FhNmE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Well what the fuck am I supposed to do?" he yelled, spinning around and punching the wall with all his frustration. He was so angry that he wasn't paying attention to how hard he hit, and his fist went straight through the plaster and wood. A sucked-in breath of pain whistled through his teeth as he cradled the injured hand. "Fuck!"</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MzFhYjJkNGY4MTRhNWJiY2Q0NjU3ODAyNzU5YWVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaelan jumped, startled by the sudden violence, but then she sighed. "You're going to wake up the entire city," she said, but her voice was gentler than it had been. "Here, let me see." Gently but firmly, she drew his hand into both of hers. Her skin was warm, and her touch was surprisingly careful. A soft shimmery glow formed around their joined hands, and he felt the pain begin to ebb. "Nothing broken," she said after a moment of concentration. "Just scrapes and bruising. I donâ€™t have much healing but itâ€™s good enough for that at least." The cuts were still bleeding slightly, and his knuckles ached, but the sharp pain was fading under her ministrations.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNzI5ZDZjYjgwNzRjZGI4Y2JjZTlmMjc4NzkyMjM4"><span style="font-weight: 400">He glared at her resentfully, even as part of him marveled at the gentle precision of her healing. "I didn't ask you for your help."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNWM1NGRmYWFlYjQ4YmRhNTRiMzUxNGU5YzI5ZTZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Technically you did," she pointed out, a hint of dry humor creeping into her voice. "When you asked me to teach you magic."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYTdkNjMyZmRkMDRhOTU4ZDIwYjUwYjY5NTJkYWE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Shut up!" But there was less heat in it this time.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTU2ZjFiMjM2NDQ5Mzk5N2Y1MDgyYWM4YjBmMDM5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaelan shrugged, loose hair spilling over one shoulder. "Have it your way."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMzI5YmQ4NDc5ZTQ1YWQ4ZWRhYzMxODExMDM1YTJk"><span style="font-weight: 400">The fight seemed to drain out of both of them then, leaving behind only exhaustion and the weight of everything they'd lost. Vertigo flexed his healed hand experimentally, then sank into the room's single chair. "If I could have it my way," he said quietly, "you would never have showed up to ruin everything I've ever worked for." He pinched the bridge of his nose, feeling a headache building behind his eyes. "This argument isn't getting anywhere."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZjkyMjNlNDEyMjQzYjI5NDBmNzFiNDAxMmY5M2M2"><span style="font-weight: 400">"I'm not </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">trying</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to argue with you," Kaelan said, and for once she sounded as tired as he felt. "You know what? Forget it. I'll go right now, and you won't have to be bothered with me anymore." She got up and headed for the door, her movements sharp.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjliOTY1YjE2YTRmYWFhMTIxYjdhN2MyOWRiMGI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Kaelan... wait..."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNzQxNDZkYjliNTQ4MjVhNzQ5MWViMDJmZDg3Mjkz"><span style="font-weight: 400">She paused, hand resting on the doorknob. She didn't turn around, but he could see the tension in her shoulders, the way her fingers gripped the metal.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ODEzNjY5ODJkODRmZjE4Mjg3N2Q5ZGM5NzhlNGE0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo took a breath, trying to find words for feelings he'd never learned to articulate. "Look, I know I'm just a half-breed mutant freak or whatever," he said, staring at his hands. "But I wanted to say that, for what it's worth, I've never seen anything like you before." He risked a glance up, saw that she was listening even if she wouldn't look at him.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYmI1NTk1ZDE1NzQ1M2I5NmJlYzdhMmI1MjM1MWI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Up until I met you, I never even knew that there were such things as angels and demons. I mean, really knew it, not just stories and legends. But you have power, real power, and that's something I can respect. And I know that technically we're supposed to hate each other's guts or something. I guess that's why you don't like me much. But like I said, I didn't know anything about any of this, so how can I hate somebody I never even knew I was supposed to hate?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YmExZTA5MGE3YTQ1ZTk5NGZkNjExMDI1OGQ5NWFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">The words were coming easier now, like water breaking through a dam. "I mean, yeah, you're kind of bitchy... okay, really bitchy... but I suppose you're just doing what you think is right, trying to save all the humans. Or whatever it is you think you're saving." He stood up, moving closer but not close enough to crowd her. "I guess what I'm trying to say is, if you ever figure out that we're not all the same - that maybe some of us are worth more than just the power we can contribute to your cause - and you start thinking for yourself instead of just following orders... and if you manage to stop this Kaldi..." His voice dropped to almost a whisper. "You can come back and find me. If you want to."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYzk1YTExYTIzMzQzNDg5MmRhNzdlOGRhZTUyMmM0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaelan was quiet for a long moment, her hand trembling slightly on the cold metal of the doorknob. When she finally spoke, her voice was thick with emotions he couldn't identify.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YzJlMThhODM2MjQ1MWI4OWY1NDExYTk1ODI3MTk3"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Goodbye, Vertigo."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOGNlYjJhMTdhZDQ3MjNhNTM2NjExYjdiZDQyNzEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">The door opened, letting in a brief draft of cold air from the hallway that carried the scents of rain and distant woodsmoke. And then it clicked shut behind her, leaving him alone with nothing but the sound of rain against the window and the hollow ache in his chest.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMWM5Y2ZiNzc3NDRhNDVhMWExZDY5YzU2YmI4Mjk3"><span style="font-weight: 400">For a long time, he stood staring at the closed door, half expecting it to open again, half dreading that it would. But it remained stubbornly shut, and eventually, he turned away. The room felt larger and emptier without her in it, the silence more oppressive.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MmFjODcwNDhhMzQ2M2ViNzM1ZDkzMjgyZWM1MDQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo moved to the bed and sat heavily on its edge, suddenly exhausted beyond measure. The events of the day crashed down on him all at once: Commander's revelation about being an angel, Argent's death, the battle with Sakurai, the terrifying emergence of his own wings, and now Kaelan's departure. It was too much change, too much loss, too much truth all at once.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNmMyOGM0MjcxYjQzM2Y4NGY0NWZlMmZkYTk5NDE0"><span style="font-weight: 400">He lay back on the mattress, staring up at the cracked ceiling. The faint scent of ozone still lingered in the air. It was the only proof that she had been there at all, that their unlikely partnership hadn't been some fever dream brought on by too much combat and not enough sleep.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZDcwZTdlNmZlMTRkNTNhZTkxMzczOTQxYzdjOWFl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Outside, the rain continued to fall, washing away the last traces of the day's battles but doing nothing to ease the turmoil in his mind. Somewhere out there, Commander was fighting his own war, one that Vertigo wasn't allowed to share. Somewhere else, Kaelan was walking away from the first honest conversation they'd ever had, back to a realm and a conflict that he couldn't follow her into. And here he was, alone again, with nothing but questions and the growing certainty that nothing would ever be the same.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZjA4MWIzMjU3ZjQzZDg5YmJkMGJmMTZkMDQ4MmM2"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Fuck," he said softly to the empty room, and closed his eyes.</span></p>
