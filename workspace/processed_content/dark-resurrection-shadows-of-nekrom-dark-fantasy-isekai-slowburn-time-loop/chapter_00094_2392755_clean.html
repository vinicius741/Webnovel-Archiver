   “…”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The silence was so profound, so imposing. As if tangible and capable of weighing down over those present.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Seeing that knightess dressed in immaculate armor, that black cape fluttering behind her, would never cease to enchant Tristessa. Nor would her heavenly beauty, that face so precious and shocked by the surprise of the encounter. And her long, blonde-silver hair that invited her to want to comb it and care for it with every fiber of her being.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Tristessa didn't know whether or not she believed in love at first sight. She didn't even know herself. But if there was truly love in her heart directed at that woman… now there was also a shadow that had fallen over it.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She was sure she would never forget all the pain her brain had retained from the two blows that Astoria had given her the night before. The fractures on her face burned despite having healed. The hellish sensation inside her still injured eye, throbbing like a heart, but pumping agony instead of blood. And the confusing, dizzying concussion that had sent her wandering in a horrible limbo of consciousness and unconsciousness that, had she not been rescued in time by Severus and then Auron, would have resulted in her Death at the hands of the Dullahan.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “It's you! The girl...” she heard Astoria say. “I-I…”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Here are the documents, you'll see that everything is in order, ma'am. Would you like to check the cargo as well?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   By offering the passports practically in Astoria's face, Auron had taken the bull by the horns. He wasn't going to allow that woman to have any control there, not even if she was the authority figure.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The knightess took the documents, but didn't even bother to check them: her red eyes met those of the gunslinger, engaged in a silent battle. She knew very well that at least two of them had entered the city by illegal means, and being so deliberately made a fool of would upset anyone.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   If she wanted, she could arrest Tristessa and Auron right there with more than enough arguments.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Tell me something, Silverthorn.” The gunslinger leaned forward a little, not at all intimidated by that beautiful countenance that combined fire and ice alike. “Haven't had enough and want to finish disfiguring the girl's face? Go on, try it, if you have the lady-balls. Let's see if your friends out there will support you in the case of a drunken and violent Imperial knightess forcing her hand against a civilian... Oh, I’m sorry! You don't have any friends, do you?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   But Auron knew exactly where to strike, where to hurt and subdue Astoria with painful and humiliating words.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Yeah, you’re all alone, huh?” he whispered at her. “No one in this world wants you. And the only girl that gave you some of her invaluable time to make you feel like you matter… You beat the shit out of her. Because you are a fucking, vicious bitch.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Tristessa just listened in silence, unable to react or reflect. She was at an internal crossroads, a turmoil of emotions resulting from the sudden appearance of this woman whom she truly hadn't expected to see again after what had happened. Under other circumstances, she would have jumped in to defend her from slander—as had happened at
   <em>
    Roundtable Cabaret
   </em>
   —but now… Now, she didn't know how to feel.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “…”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Without saying anything, without replying to Auron’s insults, Astoria turned her attention back to the gray-eyed girl, and it made her heart twist in pain. Even more so when she entered the coach completely and, leaning slightly forward, walked past the gunslinger.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “You’re a lie, Astoria Silverthorn. Even by helping a million unfortunate souls, you won’t be able to prove to anyone that you’re not a monster like your ancestor…”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Auron continued to press where it hurt the woman the most, wanting to provoke her. Wanting to make her act with unreason, out of sheer violence. Wanting her to make a mistake so that, in order to pay for the damage caused, the Imperial soldiers would have no choice but to let them go in peace.
  </span>
 </p>
 <span>
  <br/>
  Stolen from its rightful place, this narrative is not meant to be on Amazon; report any sightings.
  <br/>
 </span>
 <p>
  <span>
   Even so, the knightess walked past and dropped to one knee on the wooden floor, so she was on the same level as the raven-haired girl, cornered against the seat, with no escape route available.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Sober, she seemed impervious to Auron’s hurtful comments. The same couldn't be said when she raised a tentative hand in Tristessa's direction and the girl couldn't help but let out a small shriek.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “No!”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The fear of being attacked again had returned, even more so coming from that person in particular. It was the fact of having been striken by Astoria that stained her soul with dread, more than the physical pain of her injuries. That's why she pressed her back against the padded chair, a reflex that made her cover her face with both arms and prepare for a new wave of profound pain coming from that woman...
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A pain that never came, as her rejection was enough to break Astoria's spirit. Not all the slander in the world would have achieved the same effect: making her beautiful countenance fall with profound guilt.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The silver-haired knightess let out a sigh that combined tiredness and sadness, knowing that she had failed again in her role, and caused a new stain on her name.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Even so, she had the audacity to close the distance and take her right hand.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “…!”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “You dare…!” Auron almost intervened, even reaching for his pistol, but slowly gave up when he saw that Astoria had no hostile intentions, quite the opposite.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She managed to get Tristessa to stop covering herself with her other hand, so they were almost face to face, terror versus guilt. And she watched as Astoria lowered her head and placed a kiss on her knuckles. A brief kiss, but one that was meant to convey several emotions and messages that, unfortunately, Tristessa was in no condition to interpret.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “W-what…?” she whispered, still feeling the warmth of her lips against her skin when she let go.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Covering herself with the invisible armor she wore to face the world every day of her life, Astoria gave Tristessa a broken smile and opened her mouth slightly to say something.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Two words. She didn't need more than that.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Farewell, kitten.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   That was it. Without waiting for Tristessa to say anything, not caring about receiving more insults or harsh comments from Auron, Astoria turned around and quickly stepped out of the carriage. Without looking inside again, she closed the door behind her.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Everything’s in order, Captain.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Auron and Tristessa heard her give them the go-ahead to leave the city, provoking different reactions among them. The gunslinger sat back, arms crossed, staring straight ahead and fixed against the wall, thoughtful. Meanwhile Tristessa blinked several times, very confused not only by Astoria's decision, but also by herself.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Very well. Take a break, Silverthorn. You have fifteen minutes, I expect punctuality,” the Captain told her, and then he addressed the soldiers at the wall. “Open up!”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   With that command, the double doors began to move, its carved black shield dividing in two and letting the light of dawn come through.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Excellent! Please, hurry up with that door! The black scaled demon-head I bought will go to waste if I don't get there in time!” Severus exclaimed, his calmness evident as he gave the vilecross the order to start moving with a gentle flick of the chain.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Yes, yes, go now, Malak Drakan,” the Captain said, and through the window, Tristessa could see his indifference compromised by a concern he couldn't ignore. “…be careful out there.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “As always, Captain! I know Entrana is not the same without me, don’t miss me!” the elf joked. “Come on, Milla! Give me some speed!”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As the stagecoach was about to pass through the gargantuan wall and leave the city, Tristessa caught a glimpse of Astoria standing on the landing of some stairs that led to the upper floors of the wall.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Their eyes met for that brief second, and the girl had the mad impulse to get out of the carriage and go and hug her.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   An irrational urge to tell her she forgave her for what she did. That she wanted her to accompany her to the Sea of ​​Trees to save innocent people. To stay by her side, so they could get to know each other better, so they could support each other.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   To tell her that she wasn't alone in this cruel world. That she didn't need to be, if there was someone willing to see beyond appearances, to forgive and forget, and fight the future together.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   But that second passed, and with it, the image of Astoria got lost behind the wall, and then there were only cultivated fields and the Maturin River flowing in the opposite direction.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Are you all right, lady?” Auron asked her.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Y-yes... I am. Don't worry.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Tristessa forced a fake smile, unaware that she had brought a hand to her chest and was clutching the fabric of her crimson dress. Not from any discomfort caused by her Baptism in Ruins, but from her aching and repentant heart.
  </span>
