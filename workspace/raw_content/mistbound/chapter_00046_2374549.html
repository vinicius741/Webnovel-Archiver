<p class="cnNkZGFjZGY0NDE3ZDRiNjU4OWJkYmIwMGVmMTg1OWFh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Spirit Walk</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> is the first step on the path of using necromancy’s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Spirit </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">concept on oneself,” Keith lectured, hovering a few inches above the ground as Ernesto sat cross-legged with his eyes closed. “To separate your spirit from your body, you must first recognize that your body is a husk. A shell, containing the spirit. The choices you make in life determine your body’s form - what you choose to eat, how much you exercise, what habits you form, the work you perform… All of these and more are the ways that your spirit imposes changes upon your body. Perhaps most telling is when you suffer an injury in spirit, and your body slowly changes to reflect it.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOTU5YjU3MzdmZjRkMmZiYjExMWVmZDU0ZjYzZTcz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto shivered slightly, both from the cold and the weight of Keith's words. Was he ready to see his body as just a shell? There had been times where he cursed the relative frailty of his body compared to the strength of his dedication - mostly when trying to climb Mount Peace to learn from his beloved Master, Research Master Graves - but… he knew instinctively that his body wasn’t something wholly separate. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkYjM3YWRjYTliMDRiMmZiYjZiMGRmNTI3YzI3YWMz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And yet your body is not merely a tool,” Keith continued, echoing Ernesto’s thoughts as his tone softened slightly. “Illnesses upon your body affect your spirit in turn. Poison, for example. So are we, then, merely a collection of thoughts and chemicals in the brain? But that too is incorrect, or else how am I here, disembodied and yet fully myself? There is more. It may never be fully understood, but there is more, and necromancers like you and I will come closer to grasping the truth than anyone else ever will.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYWY3ZWI3NzgyMjQwODM4ZWQ3ZGQxZmI1NTZhMjc1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Keith’s voice grew more excited even as the air grew colder around Ernesto, a reflection of the ghost’s passion. Ernesto focused on his breathing, trying to steady himself against the chill. He could feel his heart beating faster, his mind racing with thoughts about the boundaries between life and death, of the ties between body and spirit. It occurred to him in a flash of inspiration - just as death brought about life, and life brought about death, the same duality applied to body and spirit. It was impossible to fully comprehend one without also comprehending the other. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmM2M0MTM4OWRjNDRkMTk4NGI1MGFlYTY0YjMxNTAx"><span style="font-weight: 400">The thought struck him with the force of a revelation, and Ernesto felt awe rising within him. He was beginning to realize just how little he knew, how much there was still to understand. Was this the true nature of necromancy? Not merely </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Rot </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Cold </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Acid</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Undeath</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, like he’d grown accustomed to… but something deeper? Something about duality? Or was necromancy, too, only half of a greater whole? </span></p>
<p class="cnM3YjU2NzY2NTQ2ZjRiNjdiMjg5OTdkMjQ4ZDc5NGNk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps its inverted form, the “holy” mana that Dan and Maeryn strove for, was always meant to pair with necromantic mana like body and spirit, like life and death. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyNDI2ODI5OWY1NjQ5MTNiNWNkMzE0Mzk0Y2U2Njlj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto had no words for the strength of wonder that coursed through him, lost in the magnitude of the idea. All he could do was continue to listen, desperate to catch every word that Keith would impart upon him. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzFkMmM2NmY3YzQxMTFhOTE3ZGNhOTg4YjJlYzI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It is undeniable that the spirit is tied to the body through the brain, but there lies the beauty of it! Those ties can be loosened or bound more tightly as we command, Ernesto! To walk the fields of spirit, you must simply loosen your binding ever so slightly, and allow your spirit to walk free - but not too free, lest you die in truth.” Keith’s voice turned grave, and Ernesto felt a cold sweat break out on his forehead, one that almost immediately threatened to freeze into ice in his eyebrows. “You must keep a tether to your body with you, so that you may return when you are ready.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0MmFhZTc4MjMzMTQ1NmU5NWViMmRjNTNiNDFiZjgx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Keith’s gaze bore into Ernesto, his eyes glowing with an eerie light. “Now, young master… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">feel</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Use your mana, and explore that wonderful brain of yours. Find where your spirit is bound, and know the truth firsthand.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5Njg2MGY2ZTg5YTQ2YWE5YjgwMWI0NWM2YjgxMzRj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto took a shaky breath, feeling a twinge of fear and excitement. He closed his eyes and began to focus, letting Keith’s words guide him into the unknown.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NGE4N2YxMjNjMDRkMzViNWI2OTNjY2UxNjU3ZDgz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, a few meters away, leaning against a wall, Dan finished scribbling his notes - in shorthand, of course - into the latest necromantic research journal. It was fascinating to hear the perspective of an accomplished necromancer. Or, former necromancer, Dan supposed, since it wasn’t as though Keith could actually use spells like this. Dan paused, eyeing the ghost suspiciously. Keith </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">probably </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">couldn’t use spells like this, he amended mentally. He wouldn’t put anything past a necromancer.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMWU3Y2RjODNjMTRkZWQ5ZGIyZjZlZTAwNThiNzRl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite feeling a bit irked at Keith’s assertion that only necromancers could approach the deepest truths about the ties between body and spirit, Dan was nonetheless intrigued by the ideas put forth. If the spirit-body connection was indeed hosted in the brain, and if it could be measured via mana - as Ernesto was exploring now - then… that was revolutionary. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmMjE3YTI1MWI0ZjQ2NmY5MTEwNjU0Y2M0YmM2Y2M4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Keith’s words suggested a simple binary: either the connection was present, or it was severed. Life, or death. A true measure of whether someone was alive or dead. Of whether someone was hanging on to life despite all odds, or whether trying to save them was pointless. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1Yjc1NmU0MjA1NjQ5ZTdhMGVlNjZmMGQ1ZGNiYjE3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan’s mind whirled with ideas. If the tie could be severed… could it be reestablished? Could death be staved off, if someone held the spirit tie in one hand and the brain in the other? Was true resurrection theoretically possible, if the body was preserved and a necromancer used </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Summon Spirit</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">? </span></p>
<p class="cnM2ODZlZDAzMTNkNDQ1ZmQ5Y2NjMGY3MjNmOWFiNGE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">The idea was big. Too big. He couldn’t focus. Dan took a long, deep breath. “Don’t get too far ahead of yourself, Dan,” he muttered. “Right now, you’ve got a hypothesis. You need to observe the spirit-body binding before you extrapolate anything further. Otherwise you’re setting yourself up for failure.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmMGEwOWRmNTlhNzRiOTRiMTEyM2JkY2NlOTIwNWU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan slowly regained control over his emotions as he continued breathing deeply. The idea of exploring the spirit-body binding was, by far, the greatest temptation he’d ever encountered for learning necromancy. He could almost feel his resistance being eroded away - a dangerous sensation, to be sure. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzMDZiYTllZGY3YTQ3NmFhZTI4YmE3MzA4NjM5YzBl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Frightening. Exciting. Terrifying and thrilling in equal measures. But dangerous, most of all. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3M2MyMDhjMTFiODQ5MjlhNzAzNmJlZTFlYzExZGFi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Necromancy was forbidden for very, very good reason. If Dan forgot himself, if he allowed himself to delve into those proscribed arts… then Dan was scared he’d lose that careful line he so vigilantly watched: the line of ethics that should not be crossed. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2MmU1OTY4ZGI4YzQxNzJhNjY2YjhhZmQxMGRhYzgw"><span style="font-weight: 400">As an alchemist, everything he did was weighed in terms of risks and gains, especially when researching something new. What if, one day, Dan decided there was a zero point zero zero one percent chance of something going wrong with raising an Undead to help him with a specific experiment? </span></p>
<p class="cnMyZTljM2QzNWFlNjRiMDQ4ZDI4ZDU0MWZiMmUyYWU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">He’d do it. No question. And after the first success, the second, the third, the tenth, the thirtieth, Dan wouldn’t think about it anymore, he’d just do it. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjc2NWUwZDRkNjRhNjdhMzFjM2I4OThhZTBiZjZm"><span style="font-weight: 400">And then something would inevitably go wrong. It always did. Someone would roll a one on that hundred-thousand-sided die, and catastrophe would strike. Maybe someone else would raise an Undead without the necessary safety measures. Maybe Dan would slip up, and get himself killed by his own Undead like Research Master Graves. But it wouldn’t change the consequences, and then - once again - a necromancer would be responsible for causing irreparable harm to Geova. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxYzJkNzMyZTllOTQ2ZDdiMjQxNmE2YmMzNWQ1NGUx"><span style="font-weight: 400">A cold shiver ran down Dan’s spine, and his hands trembled. At least, as an alchemist, the scope of possible damage he could do was usually fairly limited. He wouldn’t accidentally destroy society if he did something reckless. But if he learned necromancy…? </span></p>
<p class="cnMxZDY4YjliNmU1YzRlOWY5NGY1MjJiNWRjZDk5YmUw"><span style="font-weight: 400">No. No, he had to stay strong, and not succumb to the temptation. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxNWRlOTVhMGI3MjQwYjM5NzkxZjM2NDIzYTU3ODgw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan breathed in, taking his time with it, drawing it out. Then he released it. Slowly. Deliberately. His racing heart began to calm. Control. He was in control. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyYmJjMzc1Y2Q4MDQ4MzZiYjA2MzQ5MTU3ZjdjNzJh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan was only going to learn the concepts. He was going to master the concepts well enough to create the inverted necromantic magic, the “holy” magic. Nothing more. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5MmZjMDBjMDVhMzQ1ZmY4MTgzMzA1ZDAyM2VmYzQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Holy” magic would be better. It had to be better. Dan didn’t have a choice in learning that, so he needed it to be better, to not be a force of nightmares. He needed it to be gentle. Constructive, not destructive. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyMDhmODhjMTEyNDQxYzI5ODlkMmNlY2E0NmU0OGZk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please, please let holy mana not have the potential for so much death and despair. Please let it be easier to contain, let it be kinder,” he whispered fervently under his breath. Because if it wasn’t… would his name go down in history for saving everyone from the Mist? Or for introducing the newest bane to his nation? </span></p>
<p class="cnMzYmZjYjVmZDBhZDRmYjk5NGZhODU1NGJlM2ZlNTIz"><span style="font-weight: 400">His thoughts were interrupted when there was an audible gasp, and Dan’s eyes snapped to Ernesto… and Ernesto’s ghost? Dan rubbed his eyes and took another look. No, he wasn’t seeing double. Ernesto’s spirit was half-risen out of his body. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1ODNhNzEzOGM4YzQzNWVhOTlhM2ZkOWVhYWI4NmVk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Excellently done, young master!” Keith praised, gliding around the odd sight and visually inspecting it. “I’ve never had a chance to see what this looked like from the other side. Extraordinary. How do you feel?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyYWE2YTYyNDA0OTQwZGQ4NDczZmZkNzZmNDhhMDk0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s… strange.” Dan’s ears were assaulted by Ernesto’s voice echoing from both his body and his spiritual self, creating an eerie, supernatural overlap. “Cold, but not unpleasant? Both free, and tethered, at the same time. But it also feels… unnatural. I’m not meant to be outside my body. Not for long.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMzg0MzNlYTAzYzRiZjY5NGJlMTFhZGZlNTE0NWQz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Keith nodded in approval. “Good. Now, return to your body. Follow that tether home, and reinforce the spirit-body binding.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM2MzI0NWEyM2MyZTQ3NWZhNDE2ZmI1N2Q5MTYyNzgz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto’s eyes - both physical and ethereal - closed, and Dan stared in wonder as his spirit sank back into his body. Then the necromancer let out a puff of air and reopened his eyes, fully one once more. “That was a lot easier,” he observed curiously. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxMzU3MDEzMzAyZjQ3MGFiNWM2YzZkZDAwZmU5Zjc3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s perfectly natural. You’ve spent your entire life like this, so of course your body and spirit instinctively grasp for the familiar.” Keith’s voice suddenly hardened, and frost erupted on the floor beneath his hovering form. “You must not unbind your spirit often, young master. Do so, and there may come a day where your spirit longs to fly free, and you begin to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Spirit Walk </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">in your sleep… and fail to return. I would not see you lost like that.” </span></p><span class="cjA1NTVlOTQ0MTQ0ZDQxYzJhMTQzNDBkYTBhMmEwMWE0"><br/>Stolen novel; please report.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNlMzM3ZTQ1N2NjZDQ5NDU5ZGEwYzNmNDY5OWE0MDNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto flinched backwards at the vehemence in Keith’s voice. “I… Okay. I won’t use it often. I’ll be careful.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3NmIyMzJjYjgzMDQ1Yzk4Y2M1YjVkMjNjMjA1MmVh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good.” Keith paused, letting the warning settle in. “Now, do it again. This time, allow your whole spirit to emerge, not just your torso and head. Be gentle with the spirit-body binding - it doesn’t require much loosening. Only relax the binding as much as you need, and no more.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhNDVkODVhZmZiZjQ1YjE4MmM2MWQ4ZWQ4YmYxODZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, teacher.” Ernesto’s eyes closed once more, and as he concentrated, Dan witnessed something he would have considered unthinkable before: a ghost blushing. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmZGE5Y2I0YThiMDQyZTdhYmEyZTdjZTBhMDI0YzEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What even is my life?” Dan muttered, shaking his head. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2NDI0MTBhMzgzMTQyMDZiNDI1NmU0MmVhOGZmNmIx"><span style="font-weight: 400">It only took a few more repetitions before Keith deemed Ernesto ready to try finding Terrance. Dan watched Ernesto emerge from his body yet again, then lay a spectral hand on Keith’s chest, concentrating. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3OGUzZDUwZjRmMDRjYTY4OTUxNjY4YjQyOTFjM2Uz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good… Good. Use me as a conduit, young master. Tell me what you find.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmYzliNmNiYzY1ZTRhZDBhMzQyYzgyYmY5Y2E2MDA3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto struggled to describe what he was perceiving. He was seeing without sight, feeling without touch. When he touched Keith and concentrated his mana on what he wanted to know - Keith’s spiritual connections - it was as though tiny, invisible strings wafted away from him into the air. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlY2Y5NTJmMGQyYTQ3NmZhYmZhM2FjOWU3YjFhMmYz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I… it’s like… there are connections leading off into nothing,” Ernesto murmured, mentally grasping two notably strong strings. They were so, so cold - so cold it felt like it burned. No, not just felt. They actually burned, pulsing with hatred. “These are… your cousins, aren’t they? The ones who used you.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNmY2NjU1MTk1NzQ0NzJiODk3YWZiODM4YzBmYWNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Very possibly. I cannot say for certain, as I cannot perceive what you are doing myself,” Keith admitted. “Keep looking. You should find a few that feel… warmer, for lack of a better word. They connect to those who remain alive.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5OGQxMTdkYTg4YzRkZDBhMDUwNTQ4ZDI5YzA1MTI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right.” Ernesto dropped the strings he’d held, looking. There was a strong one, burning brightly, that felt warm. He touched it lightly, realizing with a start that the other end led to his own chest. He glanced up at his teacher’s face, embarrassed but pleased to know that Keith’s fondness for him wasn’t a lie. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxNTFmYmM4ZDQ3NDQ0OTRhMzBhMzM1YjZlZTk4NTQ2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Not daring to say anything for fear of making things awkward, he moved on, and eventually found two less-bright strings. The first led… nearby, though Ernesto had no idea how he knew that. It felt sharp. Sharp like a blade against one’s throat, and he had to stop himself from double-checking his own neck. That had to be Maeryn, and the string reflected Keith’s impression of her as she ended his Undead life. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmMjg1MmZiZGM4YjQ2ZTc5ZDY3NDcxMDM3MWZkMDI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">The other string… was dimmer, a little less tangible if such a word even applied, but still there, leading off some distance. But… not as far as Ernesto had feared. “That… should be Terrance,” he murmured. “I think if I just… focus on going to the other end…?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyMjUxYmYyY2QzZTRiMmY5NDM2MjAwOTFjZDdjYTI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto’s ghostly eyes suddenly blazed in supernatural flame, and he felt incredibly odd as his spiritual form stretched and compressed in a way he had no words for. A split second and a relative eternity later, the necromancer was floating in front of a wide-eyed Terrance. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwNDI2MWE2M2M1MDRjNmM4N2ViYWM2MzRiN2Q3ZjA1"><span style="font-weight: 400">They were in a dark but comfy-looking nook in a nondescript alley, with random storage boxes littering the area, but Ernesto only paid his surroundings the slightest bit of attention. “Terrance!” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhM2JhYWFjMmNiZTRmZDE4ZmUwNmQxMmIxMzc0YTEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ernesto?” the rogue breathed. “You’re dead?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3Zjk5NzcwNjEwNzQ4MTlhMmQ0MzgxNTA0NTFiZjNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not exactly. It’s a spell.” Ernesto grimaced - he’d only been away for seconds, but he could already feel his body calling him back insistently. “Listen, I can’t stay long! Frankie will meet you at Skyflower Park and lead you back to us! We’ve got everyone, including Maeryn!” </span></p>
<p class="cnM2NTVmZGUyMTQxMjRhMjc4ZTVjMmU3MTI3NTkyZWRk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? Skyflower Park? I…” Terrance cut himself off. “Right! I’ll meet you there!” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwNjk4MzZhOGVkNzRiMGJhMWEwODRlZGE5MjU1OGZl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto opened his mouth to wish him well, but the pull from his body grew too strong to resist, and once again he felt that collapsing-expanding-stretching sensation, and abruptly he was back in his own body, gasping. He clutched his chest and bent over, feeling absolutely wretched.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MDk5MmE2MTkzZjQ3ZjNiZGYzZjIxNThjZTBkM2Fh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And there is the backlash from going too far from your body,” Keith lectured sternly. “Remember it well. In time, you will be able to go further, but be mindful of your limits, young master.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlYzgyZTdlZDM5MjQyMzVhMzU2NzhkYjczMGI0NjEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I… I will. Ow.” Ernesto grimaced, rubbing his chest where the pain still lingered, albeit fading slowly. “Why didn’t you warn me?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzMTU4MTQ2YzQ3YjQzYjNiMjgxOTJjZDBmNjE3ODli"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because then you would have hesitated,” Keith responded simply. “This was the course of action you and your comrades decided upon, and I knew that the backlash would serve as a useful lesson. Experience is often the best teacher, especially in matters as delicate as Spirit magic, where you must rely on your instincts more than anything else. Now you will intimately know the consequences should this be necessary in the future, and you have a better grasp of this magic.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYWNlYWI2YmQyZTRhZDViNzJlZDY1YmVjN2UyODEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto frowned, a hint of frustration crossing his face, but he let it go. He needed as thorough an understanding of necromancy as possible if he was going to help invert it. And if that meant learning some lessons the hard way, so be it. He would just have to remember that Keith wasn’t opposed to letting him experience painful consequences firsthand.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNTNmZWQyMTljYzQ3MDE4NTRhM2M2NWVhYWE1NGEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">The sound of footsteps coming from the side distracted him from his musings, and Ernesto looked up to see Dan standing a few feet away, looking as cool and calm and collected as ever. “I take it you got the message to Terrance?” he asked. At Ernesto’s quiet affirmation, he nodded. “Excellent work, Ernesto. I’ll let Frankie know to get going. Get some rest; you’ve definitely earned it.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhYjkzMTk2MWNjZTRmMjNiODVjOTIyM2Q5YjMxOGVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto couldn’t help the smile that bloomed across his face as the alchemist briskly walked away. Dan had never been harsh, or strict with him, but he tended to reserve words of praise for breakthroughs. It definitely felt good to have Dan’s sincere approval after having learned two </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Spirit</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> spells in a single night. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3NWI4NDY1N2ZiOTRkMmY5NGJjOTc5MmJkNzI5ZGNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">It made him feel like a real member of the team, and not just a necessary tag-along. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5NjkwZDE0ZGM3MjQ3MzM4MTY1NjE0MzhmMjczYmM4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“He’s right, I hope you know,” Keith told Ernesto softly. “You have done magnificently today. You should rest, and allow your insights to settle within you.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYTE3M2VkN2ExNzRhNDY5Njk1MmExMzIzYjY4ZDdh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto took a deep breath and let it out slowly. “Okay. Just… one more question?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZTg3OWQyMWRkYTQzZWQ4MzY0NWU0YTgyMzU1MTMw"><span style="font-weight: 400">The ghost smiled. “Ask.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzMjY1YjBhNDRhYjRiZmY4ODFmY2VlMDNmNTBkNjcx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Mist… the Mist that is generated by the Undead. Do you know how to convert it back to normal mana?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiOWM0NmI5MTNjZTQ1MjNhN2RjY2Y3OGY4YTY2NWE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Keith’s face fell slightly. “I do not. I never felt the need. You see, the Mist is only harmful to creatures that cannot control necromantic mana. For those like us who wield it, the Mist can actually serve as a source of strength. With a little more training, you could walk into a cloud of it and absorb its energy, coming out not only unharmed but temporarily empowered.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5YWNjYzhkZGMzMTQ1Njg5ZDNjZTcwMzU2ZTkzNWZl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh.” Well, that was simultaneously disappointing and enlightening. “Wait. Suppose I did that. Just, walked right into a cloud of Mist and absorbed its energy. The Mist would dissipate, right?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZTk1NTE2MDMzMDQ4NzBiYWQ2ODE5NTllMjE2OWEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, of course. With no mana left within it, the Mist would collapse on itself immediately. Why do you ask?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwMjQ2MGU2OWQ0MjQxYTBhOGRkMzFjOTU3MmNiMDg4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto blinked before the truth struck him like a rock to the head. He flushed, embarrassed. “We never told you what we were doing, did we?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjNjJhMmFiODAwMzRiYWE4OWZlODhhMWJiNzNlNjcy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No. No you did not.” Keith made as if to sit down, crossing his legs as he floated a few inches above the ground. “Tell me everything.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyMzdlYTlhMjAxMjRhNGJiNmRlYjNjODMyYjJkNTU1"><span style="font-weight: 400">And Ernesto did, explaining the Mist situation on the continent, how mana had grown scarce, and his team’s efforts to invert necromantic mana. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhOWFiMjZlZTQwNDRhOGU4OWQzZjU1YjVhOGJiMmM0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Keith listened intently, his expression growing more serious as Ernesto spoke. When the living necromancer finished, Keith’s gaze was distant, as if processing the magnitude of what he’d just learned. “A dire situation indeed,” he murmured. “No wonder young Captain Maeryn was so upset when she learned that the Research Council had known for years about the nature of the Mist. Yet, your approach to invert necromantic mana is... bold. Dangerous, but bold. It has never been done, to my knowledge.” He met Ernesto’s gaze intently. “I cannot wait to see the result.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiMzRlYTZiNDUzNTRhNDI5Y2FmZGI0OGU2ZjY1ZjNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’re working on it, but what you said gave me an idea. If I can just absorb the Mist, that might make for a good stopgap!” Ernesto finished excitedly. “At least until we can finish inverting necromantic mana to create a purification rune sequence!” </span></p>
<p class="cnM2YzZmY2M4YzMzYzQzMzFhMzJmZDU3ZTA3Y2NjYzJk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Keith scratched his spectral chin consideringly. “Theoretically, perhaps. But it’s not sustainable. There are consequences to absorbing too much mana in too short a time - though what they are, I do not know firsthand. The tomes I read suggested myriad side effects, from body mutation to being converted into a living, inextinguishable flame until your body is finished being consumed.” He shook his head. “Realistically, you would need to use the mana you absorb as quickly as possible - and for necromancers like us, that would involve either massive environmental damage using cold, acid and rot…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MmU3NzljZDQ2ZDRmNzc4ODllODFhMDI2YTUyZGMy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...or raising more Undead, which would only accelerate the Mist coming back,” Ernesto finished with a sigh. “Blight. I thought I was onto something there.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlZTM1NmIwZDg1ZjQ2MDk5Yzc5OWYyNzVmOTBkMzI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Keith gave him a ghostly shrug. “As my father used to say, not all ideas are winners, but if they propel you to better ideas, they are still worth having.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwMzEyZWFlMzhlNjRiMDNhOTg0N2RmMDVhY2ViNzk4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto paused to consider that. “That sounds really wise, actually.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNzdkODA1NzJmMDQ2NmViMjVkY2E5NDZmODM2MmIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I certainly thought so, growing up,” Keith agreed. “I also thought it was a nice way to not make me feel bad after some spectacularly stupid ideas, though.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZGUwMzFkYmIwMTQ5ZDBhZTljMTE5M2MzZDdkOGNm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“... What kind of stupid ideas?” Ernesto couldn’t help but ask. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0NGRlMjdiZmNjNDQzZmZiODkzMTRkMGNkMWI5YTUz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The kind that a bored, rambunctious youth with entirely too much free time might have,” Keith told him, a hint of a smile gracing his lips. “And you won’t get a word more about them tonight. It’s time to rest, young master. Meditate on the insights you’ve gained tonight, and rest easily knowing that your performance today was magnificent.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiMjlkNTNiMjEyMjRlMzhiMTYyODFmMTRmYjQ5YjBl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto sighed, realizing he wouldn’t get anything further from his ghostly mentor tonight. “Yes, teacher,” he grumbled, slowly getting to his feet and heading towards where Maeryn rested. The backlash from his </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Spirit Walk </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">was almost entirely gone by now, and sleeping on his own away from everyone else felt… unwise, given recent events.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNDRlMDI4Y2VlMzQ0NWNhMGM0NWQ1OTg0NDQ3MGQx"><span style="font-weight: 400">It only took a minute for the necromancer to reach the back alley where everyone had temporarily set up residence. Frankie was gone, fetching Terrance, and it looked like Peter had gone with her. Maeryn was fast asleep, resting atop a makeshift bed made of broken-down crates and straw - scavenged from behind another shop - topped with a small, thin blanket that Dan had provided. Ernesto was honestly kind of beginning to see Frankie’s point about Dan’s magic pockets - the man really did have almost everything in there somewhere. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxNWU2MTQwNzA3YTRjNTU4NzQ0NTJmMWNhNDg5YmUx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Though how Dan had kept a whole blanket on his person still escaped him… </span></p>
<p class="cnMwNzg2NmM1ZjlhZjRmYTI5MGI0ZDY4NjU2YjVlMjY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn shifted slightly in her sleep, and the tiny grimace on her face as she did pulled at Ernesto’s heartstrings. She’d gone all out to rescue them, and Ernesto wasn’t sure they would have made it out without her - not with that many guards. But this was the consequence. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1OTY3MTFlZDY0MjRlY2FhZWI4Yjk5OGU2MmU3OTFh"><span style="font-weight: 400">… Ernesto had to become stronger. Not just to finish inverting necromantic mana and save the world, but to make sure that Maeryn didn’t have to go through this again. If only there was something he could do, some way to take the edge off… </span></p>
<p class="cnM0M2Y5YzJlMTAxYTRhMTJhMDZhZDAzZmQ2ODMwYjA2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Wait. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1Y2Y0MjU1YzY4YTQ1NTBhMDg0ODdmOTU4NzFlZGE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto did have something that might help. He hurried over to Dan - who was faithfully keeping watch over the slumbering captain - and whispered his idea. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjNTRhYjE2OGJkMzQ3Zjg5ZDdlNWRkOWQ2YzZhZGM4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan thought about it, then gave a firm nod. “Do it.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlNWExNzBhNTQwNTQxNjVhMTU2ZWVhYmVmMDljYjBi"><span style="font-weight: 400">The necromancer approached Maeryn, carefully gathering mana and twisting it into the correct spell. A pale green light emanated from his palm as he got close, and Ernesto breathed slowly, making absolutely certain he had this right. Finally, once he was close enough, Ernesto touched her hand as gently as he could. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">“Vitality Boost</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5MWEyM2JjYTA2OTRlZGY4MzYwZmM3OTQ5NjAwNDJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">The pale light was sucked into Maeryn’s body, with no visible effect, but Ernesto was satisfied nonetheless. He was intimately familiar with that spell - it was one of the first his Master, Research Master Graves, had taught him. It would accelerate her body’s digestive processes, giving her faster strength and stamina recovery; Ernesto had used it on himself frequently enough in order to climb Mount Peace when his Master holed himself up there. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5MTE3NjJiOGU5MTQxZjVhODI1OTE1Mzg4Yjg1OTkw"><span style="font-weight: 400">If Ernesto was right - and he was pretty sure he was - the spell should also accelerate her body’s natural healing processes. She’d probably be hungrier than a starving Mistwarped beast when she woke, but… with any luck, Maeryn would feel much, much better. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2MWFkMzAwMTZjNzQ3ZTJhYjI3YjBiZTgyMmRlMTJj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Satisfied with his good deed, Ernesto sat down against the wall between Dan and Maeryn, and closed his eyes. It’d been a long day, and now that he thought about it, he really was quite tired. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiZTEwODc2MTMwZTQwNGI4MjU5NWUyNjkxMDRiMjIx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Much to his own muted surprise, he passed out in under a minute. </span></p>
