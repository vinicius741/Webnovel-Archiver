   tay close, everyone," Jabari's boots squelched against the squishy floor as he led them through the Sepulcher of Ysolde. It looked more like a cathedral made of living flesh, with sickly brown growth covering Imperium steel. They needed to reach the chamber holding Ysolde before their enemies found and revived her.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Such fascinating organism!" Ume exclaimed with wide eyes. She reached out to touch a pulsating wall. "These creatures are very good at infesting human structures — perhaps we could take a sample back to study?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I wouldn't be so excited about it, Ume," Jabari chuckled awkwardly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Eight Ologuns flanked them, their dark green armor a comforting sight in this disturbing place. Prince Laurent led the way, looking calm despite their grim surroundings. A Psytum Sword hung from his belt, ready if needed. The Moondust Crystal shard in a pouch at his waist gave off a faint blue glow through the fabric.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Not a single corpse down here," Laurent commented. "But this structure is completely infested. The Fenris Horde is thorough."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The walls seemed to move at his words. The only light came from fleshy growths that gave off a sickly glow, illuminating Chinese dragon designs and Egyptian columns between the organic matter.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Feels like we're inside the belly of something ready to eat us," muttered Jabari, watching the strange growths retreat from their lights.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "This site was meant to be a symbol of peace between our people and the Imperials," Laurent glanced back with a sharp grin. "Perhaps some things were never meant to last."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Whatever comes our way, we fight." Jabari kept his hand near his Plasma Rifle for reassurance. His Vibro-Spear hummed quietly on his back.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Ume," Laurent looked ahead, his voice even. "Review the Moondust Activation Chant for me. I know it's in your data."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "At once." The android straightened up and began reciting, "*Chandra ki, Dhool, Mann ka Saagar —*"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Ah, not the Final Activation." Laurent raised a hand. "The middle section, please. The one about Shard Calling."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Of course," Ume continued as they walked. "The middle section is, *Akhandit chetna, kalateet rahasya*."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That's the one. Thank you, Ume." Laurent nodded, satisfied.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It means 'Unbroken consciousness, timeless mystery' in Devavāṇī, the language used by Djinnos and Imperials," Ume explained to Jabari.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It sounds quite elegant," Jabari said shyly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The corridor narrowed, forcing them into single file. The walls pulsed like a heartbeat, and the air smelled like copper and blood.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A harsh chittering sound came from ahead—multiple creatures moving toward them.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Skuggrs," Laurent whispered, reaching for his pouch. "At least six of them. Weapons ready, but hold fire."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The first Skuggr rounded the corner, skittering along the wall with unnatural speed. Five more followed, their shells gleaming in the pale light. Acid dripped from their jaws, sizzling on the floor.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Sir?" one of the Ologuns asked, raising his Plasma Rifle.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Hold," Laurent commanded, taking out the Moondust shard. The crystal glowed brighter now, casting everything in blue light. "Conventional weapons attract more. Time to test our artifact."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "As you say." The Ologun lowered his weapon reluctantly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Laurent held up the shard and spoke clearly: "Akhandit chetna, kalateet rahasya!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The effect was immediate. The Skuggrs froze, their bodies shaking. They made high-pitched sounds of distress. Two began attacking each other, while others spun in circles or ran away.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What's happening to them?" Jabari asked, watching with fascination and horror.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Laurent answered with strain in his voice: "Breaking... their connection to the Hivemind. They... don't know what to do without its guidance."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Skuggrs tore into each other, green fluid spraying across the walls. Soon only one remained, and it retreated in fear, disappearing into the darkness.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Laurent suddenly staggered, dropping the shard. Jabari lunged forward, catching both the Prince and the crystal.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Prince Laurent!" Jabari steadied him, sounding concerned.
  </span>
 </p>
 <span>
  <br/>
  If you discover this tale on Amazon, be aware that it has been stolen. Please report the violation.
  <br/>
 </span>
 <p>
  <span>
   Laurent touched his ear, wincing. "Ha, the damn thing screams in my head. Like a thousand voices at once?" Despite his pain, he smiled. "Funny how they never mention the side effects in the data. 'All-powerful artifact, may cause splitting headache and existential dread. Use only as directed.'"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Prince straightened with effort. "Keep moving. The effect is…temporary. They'll reorganize soon."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Sir," Jabari looked at the shard in his hand, still glowing. "I should hold onto this for now. I'm not psionic, it can't affect me the same way."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Laurent studied him, then nodded. "Smart thinking. Just don't try to use it yourself. Unless you fancy your brain being liquidized and poured out your ears."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "No sir, I prefer my brain where it is," Jabari replied, putting the shard in his pouch. The crystal felt warm against his leg.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   They moved forward, the air growing thicker. Laurent stopped at an ornate section where different architectural styles merged.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Suddenly, the wall in front of them moved — a Bone Fiend jumped at Jabari with fangs bared. Without hesitation, Jabari raised his rifle and fired, the plasma rounds tearing through the creature. It fell, twitching as its fluids steamed.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Good. You're capable outside of a mech," commented Laurent, still looking ahead. "Some Scarab Riders these days can't even use a handgun."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I remember my training well," Jabari nodded as they continued.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "But your connection to that android is unusual," Laurent said quietly as they walked. He still winced occasionally from the shard's effects.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Ume is more than just an android," Jabari replied, glancing at her as she examined the walls with curiosity.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Perhaps," Laurent admitted. "But attachment is a liability in our work. Remember that when the time comes to make hard choices."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari didn't respond, feeling the weight of the crystal in his pocket.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   They rounded a twisted pillar that seemed alive. A large pool lay before them, filled with thick green liquid that moved gently and glowed. Transparent eggs floated on the surface, bobbing up and down.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Behold, the Genesis Pond," Laurent announced. He stepped closer, looking at the pool with interest. "This is where most modern Radi-Mons are born. The Hundkyndas bring their eggs here to soak in processed Helionite. It's common in Fenris hive clusters."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Never heard of the 'Hundkyndas'," Jabari muttered, watching the eggs move.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Female humans exposed to the Nucleus Virus and impregnated by male Radi-Mons," Laurent explained with a snort. "Most are not willing, so we decided to keep this information from the public."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The people should know! Then they'd see how dangerous the Radi-Mons are," Jabari said, shocked.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Directorate keeps this secret for good reasons," Laurent said casually. "Imagine if new recruits knew they might face such things. No one in their right mind would join the DSC."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Unlike the clean fusion facilities humans used, here raw Helionite was processed through biological means. The green liquid churned as the chamber's tissue broke down and reformed its molecular structure.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Along the walls, crystalline growths pulsed with blue-white light - living Zephyrium processors that had grown within the Radi-Mon hive. Where humans needed complex machinery and radiation shields, the Fenris Horde had evolved to process fusion materials in their biology.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "See those tendrils?" Laurent pointed to organic tubes connecting the pond to the walls. "Radi-Mons process fusion minerals through their own flesh. What we consider waste, they eat as food." He indicated where a crystal was forming. "They don't just mine Zephyrium - they digest it. Their entire hive is one huge, living fusion reactor."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari watched in horror as a glob of Helionite was absorbed directly into the wall, which pulsed as it processed the radioactive material. No containment chambers, no safety protocols - just raw efficiency that made human fusion technology look primitive.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Still, we should destroy the eggs," Jabari said, eyeing them warily. "These look ready to hatch."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Laurent chuckled and raised a hand. "Save your ammo, Lieutenant. These eggs are connected psychically to their mother, a Hundkynda who lives here. We don't want to alert her to our presence...yet."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Sir," A young Ologun marine spoke up. "The Radi-Mons only attacked an hour ago. To already have a Pond here…"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That's how fast the Fenris builds. And why they have so many minions," Laurent sighed. "I suspect they've found Ysolde and freed her. Fun times ahead."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "We have enough firepower. Just keep your cool," Jabari said to encourage the Ologun.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Aye, aye," the soldier replied stiffly as they walked on.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari noticed the golden rings on Laurent's hand catching the light. They glowed briefly before dimming, showing his psionic power.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "How's your head?" Jabari asked quietly, seeing Laurent's slight grimace.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Like someone's playing a drum solo inside my skull," Laurent admitted with a wry smile. "Makes me wonder if your Sand Lotus friends had a point about not using the Crystal. Though I'd rather die than admit that to their faces."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "They're not my friends," Jabari corrected quickly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "No?" Laurent raised an eyebrow. "That Imperial Rishi seemed quite interested in you. Fuuka, was it?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari felt his cheeks warm but kept his expression neutral. "What do we do now? We found some Radi-Mon eggs, but still no sign of Ysolde," he said, changing the subject.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Ume spoke up, holding her Plasma Handgun tightly. "The Sepulcher's layout seems very complex. Perhaps the infestation has changed its structure?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It does seem different since my last visit," Laurent stroked his chin thoughtfully, looking at the split in the path ahead. "We'll have better luck if we split up. Why don't you two search the left tunnel while the Ologuns and I take the right?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Agreed," Jabari said, feeling the weight of the Crystal shard in his pocket. "Let's move before these eggs hatch."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Good luck. Stay on the voice channel," Laurent led the way, his chains jingling softly as they separated.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The left tunnel seemed to close in around them as Jabari and Ume went deeper. The organic matter grew thicker, forcing them to push through fibrous tissue that stuck to their armor.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I've been analyzing the Crystal fragment's energy," Ume said softly as they walked. "It works on frequencies similar to quantum entanglement communications, but more advanced."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Is that why it affected Laurent so strongly?" Jabari asked, ducking under a hanging tendril.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Possibly. The fragment seems designed to connect directly with psionic neural pathways," Ume paused, tilting her head as she processed information. "I think it's trying to establish a connection with something—or perhaps many things—across vast distances."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Maybe such things were never meant for humans, huh?" Jabari murmured, remembering Thorin's words.
  </span>
