<p align="left" class="cnNiZWQ4NzYyOWI2YTRiZTRhNjcyZGMxMjVkMjNhYWY1">The vampire had already told Sora to wait up stairs while she intended to investigate. Beneath the living quarters of the inn, there was the sound of drinking late into the night. Emma didn’t immediately go to the bottom floor.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMyODY4NjM1NzYwMzQ4OTFiMjc1NjhiY2IyODg0MWNk">Instead, she chose to investigate one of the rooms. She transformed herself into a frozen mist once more and sunk beneath a door.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM3MWM2ZTMwMzBkNjQwOTFiNzg0NTkxZGM5NGIwZmY4">The first room she tried was empty of visitors. There was a small straw bed with a fur blanket draped over it. There was an end table, a chest at the foot of the bed, and in another corner of the room there was a neat, empty wooden wardrobe. On top of the inn table was a quill and some ink.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM4ZDMxODAzY2ViZTQ5ODk5ZWVhYWM2MDgzNTRmMjYy">Emma decided to slip into the next room in her mist form, but this time, there was a couple. She immediately slipped back into the hallway, leaving them to their business.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM4NGQyMzEzOTVlMjRmYjliMzBkZjYxZmE0MTQwOTY2"><em>I should have known from the sounds… </em></p>
<p align="left" class="cnNiY2I2YmFlNjViOTRkNzA4ODA1YWU2NzlkNjhhMDUw"><em> </em>She had no idea if it would make her some kind of pervert to loot a room while people were going at it, but she knew it wasn’t something she wanted to watch. Though, it did leave the vampire with a lingering question in her mind.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM4ZGZiYzMwNTBjMjRiNTE5NmVhYmM2OTdlMTBiNWVj"><em>Do I still have a libido? I haven’t felt a need like that since arriving. Then again, I’ve not even been here for that long. It hasn’t even been a week. Hmm?</em></p>
<p align="left" class="cnM4MzcwOWE1OGJmYjQ1NDQ5YmM2Njg2YThmZjg3OGM3"><em> </em>Several of her mist particles glowed, and she instinctively knew it was Karlack. She obeyed its request, slipping into the next room.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM0M2EwZGQ3NzRhODRlYmViODE0ODk1NTQwMjAxNDE3">The vampire noticed a difference right away. This room was much larger. Moreover, it seemed to be enchanted. Emma’s only guess was soundproofing, and it made sense. She could no longer hear the baby making from the room next door.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM0ZjBhZDQyMmYzNDQ4ZGZiNzg3NDQwYTAzMGUxOGJi">This one did have a guest. He was sound asleep on top of a much nicer bed. It had red drapes hanging down, and the man slept in a nice sleeping suit.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMwNDYyYjFjNmZmZTRlOTA4MmY0MGFjMGZmMzNlMDE0">She noticed there was a wooden staff next to his bed, and on the end table, there was a pointy hat. <em>A wizard?</em></p>
<p align="left" class="cnNmMmJiN2M2YzFlMTRjMzc4YTA3NTRmMmM5MmZiNzlm"><em> </em>Emma risked making herself whole again. She wasted no time reaching for both the staff and the hat. However, when she picked up the hat, she noticed a letter underneath.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM5ZjdiNzNhMTU2YzRiZGRiODU3ZGMzODlmOTcxZDI1">She pocketed the letter, being extra careful not to disturb the sleeping man. She slowly walked to the door and unlocked it, gritting her teeth at the stupidly noisy clicking sound of the lock.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM4NTdiYTJlMmNiZTQ0NmZhZGUzNTAzYTg2NjU5MWU0">The vampire whipped her head around, but the man remained sleeping. After double checking, she fled into the hallway. After making sure the coast was clear, she ran back up to the storeroom with the letter, hat, and staff.</p><span class="cjAwNWRhMzFjZDQ1ZDQwM2Q4MTczMGM1MGU1MTI4ZDA1"><br/>This novel's true home is a different platform.

<p align="left" class="cnMyODg5Yzk1NzhmMzQ0ODA4ZGQyZjQzN2FjYmQzZTQ3">“Lady Emma?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM0MDRiOTZlNWMwMjRmNzhiYWVhMGNlODkyNWI0YjVh">“That’s me…Wait, why have you said Lady? I’m not…”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM2NjQ3ZmY4NGE1MTQyNmVhNzZmMzUxYTdjNjBhNzkw">“Emma’s not a lady?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMyMDExMDgzYzkwMDQwNTI4ZTNmNjY0YjA4NmQ1NDdi">“That’s not what I meant! Anyway, I found these down there.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM2M2YyN2RiYjExODQ1Y2FiNTMzOTIzY2UwOWE4ZWE4">Sora’s eyes widened as she looked at the items. “A letter? Did you steal these?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMxZTg1YmZkZGNjNzRlNjg5ZWU4NTJhYWRlOWRmMmFj">“Of course, I did. This is the first time I’ve seen such items since arriving here.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM3YTJiZWFmMjM4MzQ3ODJiNGFhODliMmQ1N2M0YmIz">“The letter? What does it say?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNiYjMyMzBmMmIyZTQyNDk4YTA3ZjMxNzBhNDQwZjM2">“Hold on, I’ll read it.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNlNjY4YWJkNjc3OTRiMzk5ZTdhNDE5NzVlMDY0Mjg2"><em>My Dear Friend, </em><em>Izuthar</em></p>
<p align="left" class="cnMwZjJjNzdjM2VkZDRlYjM5NTJhOWM2OGRiNWViZmMz"><em> As the hailed wizard of Southwatch tower, I imagine you have limited time on your hands. However, I’d have you travel to the north. Can you do me this one favor for an old friend? </em></p>
<p align="left" class="cnNhYzI4OTE5NjE5YzQ1NTU4ZjdlZGU1ODRhZjQyMTEy"><em> And remember, the time of permafrost is upon us. Do make haste. </em></p>
<p align="left" class="cnM0OGYwMDU5OTcyYTQ3OTg5MzFmOTFlN2FjNTc3OWYz"><em> Your old friend, Cynthia </em></p>
<p align="left" class="cnMxM2M0ZGFiZWVmODQ1NmY5YzEzMjlmN2ZmYjUxNjk1"><em> </em>“I don’t really understand any of it, but…”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNjNjNjYmMwYjRiYzRiNDlhNDc0NjZjY2UwZWMyODU3">However, before she could continue, her words were cut off by a wand pointing at the back of her head. A humble, elderly voice sounded off from behind her.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMxNDBmMjFhZWE5MTQ5Y2Y5NGQzMzQ0M2QzZjk4ZDBl">“Is this customary for you. A vampire? Not quite, but an interesting specimen...That is certain.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNiYTBjOTkxY2RmMzQ2ZDRiNjBhZmM1OWVkNWE1YzU5">“Who?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM5NDYwZDRmYjU4ODQzN2RiOTQ1ODFiMzAyNzA4NjY2">“I would say to uphold the virtue of silence for now. Besides you already know it, don’t you? The letter should have spoken of my name. You’re a nosy one, clinging to certain ideas. And not only that. Thou doth keep a child. Most intriguing to be sure.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNmZTkxNjVjZTE5NzQ4YmRiNDI1NzY5N2U2YzRkOGNi">Emma’s eyes widened, but before she could speak Sora jumped to her feet.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNhMmZjMTkyY2Q1ZDQxYTdhY2NiN2QyMjliOTY3Njkz">However, the wizard—Izuthar—cut her off by signaling with his palm. “Do not hasten yourself, for I share no such proclivities as the Dawn. Rather, this is more of an idle curiosity. For that is the reason I allowed you to take my belongings, is it not?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMwYjM2NDk1NzNkNjQ2N2Q5ODE3NGQ4ZDRkY2Q4ZTEx">“Y-you allowed?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM3NjRkODAyNTdhZTQwYTRhMmRkNjE5ZmFmYmI4MTM0">“Hohoho,” Izuthar laughed heartily, “you think I’ve not traveled across these realms far and wide? For why would I have a soundproofing spell on my side? You’re lucky you hadn’t tried using my staff.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMxNmMwZDE0NzUxMTRjYzc4NzUzYWY1NTZmMGRiMmQx">“What does that mean?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMzNWVhYzIzNzkyMDRmNDlhMWM3MDU5ZTVmNjc1Mzk3">“That staff is also enchanted, little vampire. Should you have used it, your body would have burned you from the inside. But, stranger than my staff is that weapon that you hold.” The wizard reached out towards Karlack. “What wonders will this one behold? May I?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNjYWQ1OTk3NjkzYzQzZTU4YzIwZmEwOGVjNmRiYjQ0">Emma frowned towards the man in red robes. His entire outfit had changed, and he had yet another pointed hat on his head. She looked towards the pointy hat she’d been holding, but it vanished like an illusion.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM5Mzk0OTk3NTY2NTQzYjc5YmE1ZWZiMGUyNDZmMjBk">“Don’t be surprised. I’d never let you grasp the real hat,” the wizard said. “For should you have done that, it would be the end. Not even an ash would remain, nor a little bat. But, I can tell you’re confused.” Izuthar retracted the wand pointing at Emma’s head. “So, I ask again, may I?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM3YWY0NWUyOWY1MDQ1MWVhODU3Y2I1MGUxNDFjNjFh">Emma nodded and handed the frost staff to Izuthar. It glowed sharply in his hands, not appreciating being held by the strange red-bearded wizard.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM5YTExOTBkZmM5ZTRjOWM5MjU1ZmMxMjUxOTQ5Yjk2">“Yes, indeed, it’s most interesting. A very amusing fate indeed. To become a weapon of ice, born from will, yet there is more to tell. More and more, until...Well, I am sure you can figure it out.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM1ZWEwZTFkZjhjZTQwOTg4NmYyMDIzNWYzN2MyNTVi">Sora asked the pressing question hanging on Emma’s mind. “What are you talking about? I can’t understand a word you say, old man!”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNlZDkzZTliZTZkYjRkMGY5MWE5ZDEyOTJiZDNjMGIw">“Hohoho, no matter. I have my staff…”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNhNzViNDEyMWZmNTQyMzhhMDYwMzI0Yzg5MGZjNDU0">Emma looked in her hand to see that the staves had swapped without her even noticing. The wizard now held his wooden staff, and she’d been given back hers without being wise to the situation.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMzOGUwYmRjMThjYTQ1ZDJiYTg5ZGY3YTQ0ZGQyOTYx">“And I bid thee farewell,” the wizard said, disappearing with a snap of his fingers.</p>
