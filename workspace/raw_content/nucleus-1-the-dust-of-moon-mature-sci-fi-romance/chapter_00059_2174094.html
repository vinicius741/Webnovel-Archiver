<p class="cnM0ZWI3MDg3ZDZjNTQyOWZiZTg5NjNhZTA1MDE4OGEw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lustsong Woods, Shashvat Ananda (शाश्वत आनन्द), the Realm of Eternal Bliss</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YjYyMDdiYjFmODRjOGM5OTAwMzQyYjk2ZTY5OWE4"><img alt="Nucleus: The Dust of Moon" src="https://nucleusseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ch44-Shashan-Riverwood.png"/></p>
<p class="cnM3ZDE1NTI2NThkMDRiZjA5Y2FmYmViYmJkZGRjNTUw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><span style="font-size: 1.5em"><strong>L</strong></span>orna's consciousness fluttered open to see an ice giant looming in the twilight sky behind the trees, her senses immediately assaulted by the heady aroma of violet blossoms. She stirred, only to feel the supple embrace of living vines ensnaring her limbs — a bed not of cloth and spring but flora, the sentient tendrils proffering a cradle that both alarmed and soothed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNTlkODExYzJlMTRkMTlhMzU3NTUyNjRlNzlkMTI1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Gasping, she blinked against the vibrant light, noticing that her silver pendant was missing from around her neck. As she took in her surroundings, her entire body felt lighter, as if carried by the gentle breeze that caressed her skin. Turning her head, with the soft texture of the botanical bed against her cheek, she saw her neatly folded garments: beige trench coat, deep blue turtleneck, silver Psi Shield Device, Quantum Watch, black military leggings and red panties — all resting on a table made of braided Banyan roots.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNTg3YzI1NDU1ZTQwMjQ4MjU4YzdiOTE4MGEyMTg3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The sight pricked at her pride; she was a Psi Lynx operative, not some damsel to be undressed and cosseted.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMzI3YjcwZjU4YTQ4ZGQ4YjUyNzgzZGEzZjk0MWEx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A nearby bush quivered, betraying the presence of another. From the foliage emerged a woman, her body a canvas of alabaster. She stood naked, with droplets of water glistening on her skin. Instead of nipples, she had two large reptilian eyes staring out from her ample breasts. Tentacles, pallid and gleaming, fanned from her back like the appendages of a cosmic deity. They writhed with a grace that unnerved, in tune with their mistress's movements. Below her waist, she had the body of a large serpent, also white and glistening but with a texture reminiscent of a snake's scales.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MGYxODRkZDhmYzQ4OWE4YzcyYzJmODUxNDViOGZi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Where..." Lorna said, voice drawn out in her vulnerable state. "Where am I?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMmVlZmFkYjY1NDQxYjlhMTYyODAxZTgxYTBhMjRi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Somewhere safe," The woman’s alto voice was a murmur.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZTRjNWE4ZTkxNzQ1YTg4OTljZWRjOGIwNzliYWE1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Safe?" Lorna echoed, her tone kindling with ire. She studied the woman closer, noting her features: skin porcelain-smooth, eyes deep and mesmeric voids that seemed to swallow starlight whole, cheekbones high and commanding as a queen's. The tentacles, now moving slower, appeared sculpted from moonstone.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZDQ4MzZiOTA4NjQxZDc5OTM0ZDg3MzI5NzMyMGIz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"What are you? A Radi-Mon? Or someone who got the Nucleus Virus?" she demanded, poised on the edge of aggression.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNmMwYzM1NGU1ZTQwZWE4ODRmYWY1ZmNkYjE2MGZh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Kathrin is my name." the woman offered with a tilt of her head and a deliberate slithering to the side, her British lilt caressing each syllable. "Stay here for a while and you may come to learn my true nature."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YzE3NmRhNDFmNTQwNWE4N2EzODVhMWU4ZmRkN2Fk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Kathrin," Lorna tasted the name. Her heightened sense of smell picked up Kathrin’s scent: a blend of myrrh, rich and resinous, with the unmistakable musk of ambergris lurking beneath, musky and oceanic. It was almost too much — sweet and dark, like the sea and fire had mingled on her skin.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZWFhY2U4Njc5ZDRjNmY5YjNjZWQ0MGY1NzgxMGE0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">But Lorna would not yield, not to this seraphic creature who whispered of safety while putting her in such a humiliating state.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZTIzZDU2Yzc2MTQ4OWZiNzU5MTgxOGMxNDk4OWYx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Alright. Out with it, Kathrin. Are you a Radi-Mon? What’s your game?" she intoned, her accent honed by the hard edges.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZmYyMWI5YjZiMzQ0MjBiN2QxMGQ0NzY2NzU1MzVk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Patience," Kathrin's smile was cryptic. "All in good time."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NTc0ZmI4N2M1NDQ4OTJiZGZhYzNlOWFiZDIzMzRm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Fuck! Just tell me already," Lorna cursed, her fingers clawing at the vines. But they did not yield, holding her fast in their verdant grasp.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNWU4OTU2ZTdiYTQzNjlhZTY2MzcwN2ExZDc3YmM5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Kathrin drifted and coiled herself next to Lorna. She reached out and gently stroked Lorna's chin. "You are among friends here, even if you don't realize it yet."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjEzYTA5ZWM5NDRjNmFiNDQ1ZDFkYWU4NzZiZjMy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Friends? You fucking stripped me naked and put me on this — this garden dritt!" Lorna swore.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZTUwZTYyMzY4YTQzMGFhNzRkMmQ3NmM4YzQzMDY0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Trust is earned, young Lorna," Kathrin said, her tentacles unfurling. "Though I'm amused you know that Jǫturmál curse. Are you a Nordling, then? Living under an alias, fearing persecution?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NTgxNzUxOGEyYzQ0YmM4NWIyMjlkMWMxNThlNDhj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"How did you know my name?" Lorna shot back.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMzhiZDVmNmNhMjRkNmI5NWRmYWU0ZTg0NTA1Y2U2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Tanha informed me. You fell through the gravity well and entered our realm through a wormhole. Your companions fought bravely to protect you, though there was no need to," Kathrin said with a smirk on her countenance.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyODNkMDNiMWQxOTQwZmM5ZmYyNjBmZDMxOWY1ZDhh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Manny and Xin, w-what have you done to them!" Lorna stammered before she shouted, her body stiff.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZDM3NmJjZGJmNTRkYzM4MTM5ZDFhM2E4NzQ3NDFm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Calm, young one. They are both safe and under inspection, much like yourself," Kathrin placed an alabaster hand on Lorna’s wrist.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZWY4MGQxMDZkMTQ2MzlhY2E1ZjEwZjgyZjVhODMz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Immobile in the botanical bed, Lorna turned her head to look at the Space Rover nearby, its white bulk offering a small sense of comfort. It sat beneath the sprawling canopy.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDgyOWE4OGQ2MTRhYjNhYjVmYmUxMzA3ODVkZDM4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Are you with the Alliance?" Kathrin inquired as wind blew through the leaves above.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDM0MjIxNzZkOTQ1ZTI4Mjc5NmQ0NDhmZTA1NzU0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"How did you know?" Lorna's voice cracked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYjM4NmYxNTk4YzRlZDc4YjMwYTZhZmJmN2M1ZGQz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Your chariot there," Kathrin gestured with one tentacle towards the Rover, "was quite the burden for our Weavers. One nearly snapped a leg hauling it from outside Door Valkyris to here."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NGU4N2FiOGY1MDQ0NGE5ODNiMzYyZjU0N2QxNDkx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"This place. What’s it called?" Her head turned to look at the violet canopy above them.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YjljMmI5ZTM3YTQyN2ZhNWZmNWM3OTg3N2FiMWM2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Shashvat Ananda, the Realm of Eternal Bliss. Our moon, Shashan, orbits the ice giant Chandrak," Kathrin replied in an even tone. "What business does the Alliance have at Door Valkyris?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYjc3NDZkNDQwMTQyZWJhNGM2MjE1ZjQ3ZTM5M2Q0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Moondust Crystal," Lorna replied. "We need it to defeat Skarn and his Fenris Horde."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlY2U0MzBkZjE2MzQ3MDNiZmZlMjUwZDllYjVhNzQ2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Intriguing," Kathrin interjected, her voice suddenly low, "our goals may align."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYzE0MWI3NWY2ZDQyZGE4MjI0ZTQ0NTU4YjdhZmQy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A caress feathered across Lorna's cheek, light like whisper, before Kathrin's fingers traced somewhere more dangerous. They settled gently but firmly on the curve of her breast, squeezing as if measuring the cup size.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZmExMjU4MDhiZTQ2NjRiZmVmNDBiMzA2MDBkNTMy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The mounds of a well endowed woman," she murmured, her finger continuing down Lorna's sternum until it reached one of her nipples. "You would make a good Sūkṛmuc."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MGI1NjM1OGFjOTQ5ZmM4NjJkMmRlM2ExMDM3MDli"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Whatever that word means. No," Lorna retorted. "I’d rather die than become a Radi-Mon."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNGJiODQ1YjMwZjQ2MjM4OTVmZDhiYWI3NWU1ODll"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Understandable," Kathrin replied, her purple lips curling upward.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOWQ1NjMzYzIwNDQxZWRiMTNmMzgyZWQ2NjRhNWEz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Hey, I'm not some lab rat for your collection," Lorna retorted once more as she tried to wriggle free from the botanical bed. Its vines held firm, the grip unbreakable but oddly gentle. "Just tell me what you want."</span></p><span class="cjc5YjcwMWVkM2JkMzQyMGE5NmI1NTYzMTEyM2ZlNmM3"><br/>This book was originally published on Royal Road. Check it out there for the real experience.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNhMDEyMzg1NGM5MDQwNWE5OTgyMzcyNmFkOTlhMTI3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"It is not told," Kathrin murmured cryptically. "but done."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMTcxZjRhZDZlYTRjMjA5NTI1NGIyYTQ1MmY5ZDg2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Before Lorna could say another word, Kathrin descended towards the area between her legs. Alarm shot through Lorna. She could feel was the Radi-Mon's hands now exploring her thighs.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3N2NkYWM1NmQ3ZDQxZmM5YTFiODY0ZDQ5MGZmN2Vi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Heat erupted within Lorna as Kathrin’s fingers brushed through Lorna's pubic hair, a meadow of soft, blonde curls.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MmY0ZDI5ZTQ0MjRlYzRhNGM3OGVhN2MxYjNiNmNj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The vines binding her limbs tightened just enough. Her legs were drawn up and unfolded by the living restraints.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NDEwODFmYzZkZjRjNjQ4ZDQ0ZjczMzIzMjNlNzgz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"What the…" her voice cracked as Kathrin's tentacles coiled around her thighs. They supported her in an oddly nurturing manner, yet all Lorna's mind could think of was a Draug ensnaring its sexual prey.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMzQ4YTdhYmVlODRjMjFiYWIxYzZhOGVmNDQ0OWUy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"We call it Parīkshaṇa, or ‘the Tasting’ in you Sol people’s tongue," Kathrin's alabaster fingers traced through Lorna's grove. "It does not hurt. In fact, some Sol people find it…enjoyable."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NGRkOTBmMjQyOTQ4ODJhZTM0NGU0MmNhOTI5MjMw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna watched, helpless, as Kathrin expertly parted her. A mix of dread and excitement crept into her veins, making her breath hitch. Her neatly trimmed blonde pubic hair glistened faintly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ODBjZjY5MzBiZDRmZjk5NWI3MmU1MzBlYmVjMzI5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"This will only be a moment," Kathrin spoke in an eerie tone.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYThmYmIzZTY1MTQ1NDI4MWRkMDEwODJkNmQyM2Iw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I'm not your guinea pig!" Lorna hissed back, her muscle tensing as she attempted to squirm away. But there was no escape; the vines reacted to her struggles, tightening, as if they were part of Kathrin herself.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYTQ3M2U3MmY4YzRkOGFhMDVmM2I0YTEzNTA0YjI0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Then came the sensation of Kathrin's ebony black, forked tongue — a serpentine thing that tasted Lorna's butt before entering her.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOTY2MTY3OGQ2MTQ4NjhhOTgzMDMwZDAzN2ZjZGYx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Fuck," she managed to choke out as Kathrin's alien tongue delved deeper, forked tips now exploring her anus.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZDJlYzIzY2M4NjQwY2U5MmYzZDlmODZmNzEyYTJh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She inhaled, taking in the heady scent rising from her own depths, like the briny tang of sea-kelp and smoked salmon. The distinct smell filled her own nostrils as Kathrin's tongue went further in, stroking with an oddly measured strength. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1YzJkZjFkNDU5ZjRhNjM5ODczOGFkMjljNmM3OTM2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You recently ovulated, but it has been several orbits since your last defecation," The Radi-Mon woman paused to comment clinically. "High stress. Insufficient water intake."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNTQ0ZTRlZGNjZDRmYmU4YjdjNTYxY2Y3MGRhMjM1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Resuming the act, her tender lips now brushed against Lorna's skin.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MDY1YzljMDE1ZjQ1MWZiYjZiZGJlMzgxNGMwZTMz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna gasped. Her vision blurred as she struggled to maintain any control. The soft pull of the Radi-Mon woman’s lips on her buttocks pushed Lorna toward an edge she hadn't known she'd been teetering on.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NjViYzA1YzFlZDQ4OGM5M2E4Mzg0NDNlNzBiNGY1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Kathrin's tentacles undulated over Lorna’s thighs as the botanical bed beneath them pulsed in time with Lorna's heartbeat, its vines caressing her skin, as if encouraging her.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NWJkMzQ3ODQ0NTQxNzU4MDM3NDA1Y2E3ZmYyYjcy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Fear tangled with desire, confusion with need. She squirmed, caught between wanting to flee and urging Kathrin deeper. The sweat that beaded on her forehead trickled down, mingling with the damp tendrils of blonde hair that had escaped her half-up ponytail.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOTc3NTViZGY4ZDQ2NDRhMzJmODQ0NzRjMWRmY2M3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Fuck — !" she cursed again as Kathrin sucked on her rim.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZGYxODBmMzIwZTQxZmM5YWFlMWViZTUxNDY5Nzli"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The moans that escaped Lorna grew louder, each more more primal than the last. She writhed, her bound limbs straining against the botanical bed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZWNiNjdkYzFmMDQxY2I5MTY5M2I3ZDUxZDQ5M2Iz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Her eyes fluttered shut, conceding as Kathrin's tongue continued its exploration of Lorna's crevice.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZDQyYjJiMTllODQ4MTY4M2JjZWQ5NmY2MzZkMmY0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">And then, without any preamble, a sensation came. As Kathrin’s lips and her serpentine tongue withdrew, a low, primal sound escaped Lorna. A sound not from someone at the peak of pleasure, but more like a beast let loose.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NTVmYzRlNzkxMjRkMTM5NDVhNDFmNDk1N2VkMjZm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A sudden clenching of her abdomen was followed by an embarrassingly loud fart.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNjJiNTcxYWM2MzQzZDhhNTI4NDJhNTE5YWE1Zjc2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">It gave way to an intense release, as she could feel her bowels emptying. The hot rush of her stool cascaded unchecked through her intestines, now making a mess on the botanical bed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZDE0M2FhNWIzYTQzNWI5ZWQ4MjMxZDM5NGE5MTk0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The smell of her own shit was overwhelming, earthy and pungent. Like a miasma with the yeasty tang and something like spiced musk or sausage. The foulness filled the forest..</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMTMxOTRlOTFkZDRhZTA5YjMwOTAwNjA3MTZkZWNj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Beneath Lorna, the botanical bed stirred, responding to her stool. She felt the delicate vines snaking towards her. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2Y2ZhY2Y4ZTI4MDQ0YTc5ZjQ2NjcwNDQ0ODdjMTRk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The vines encroached, closing in on the feces, then swallowed. Literally swallowing it into the bed’s surface.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOWM0NGQxZjczODQxNjQ4ZGM2OWNjMzJkNjIwMGI0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna panted, her chest rising and falling rapidly, her body slick with sweat as the vines' grip eased. Kathrin lower her head once more, her tongue licking Lorna's skin, cleaning her colon and erasing traces of her release. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZGNkYTEwMDNkNzQ2Njg5YzJjZGRmYWU5NjQzMjg4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The strange blend of humiliation and ecstasy blurred into something she could not name.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxODUwYWFjYTBiZjQ3ZDY4MTk4YzAzN2RhY2MwY2Ix"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She opened her eyes to the sight of tall purple trees stretching above, their leaves rustling in the wind.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNGRhM2VjOGU5YjQ5NmI4ZGYxMWUzOGZmNDFjNzEy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Kathrin stood, her tentacles retracting. It drew Lorna's gaze upward, locking onto the Radi-Mon’s sleek white silhouette and the violet canopy above them. "The Svadavidhi – Bed of Extraction – requires some time to digest your waste. The diagnosis should come in shortly."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYmI4NjNhNDdlMzQwMGE4ZjA2Y2RkZTM0ZGMwZmQ4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Fuck..." Lorna made a raspy whisper, having no idea what was going on.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3N2Q4NTE0NjY4MDQyN2Y4OWRkMDIzNDY4YmQ5NWY1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Your body is in good health, with a strong Lunar affinity," remarked Kathrin, her clinical tone a stark contrast to the intimacy of her actions as she rested one hand on the bed. "But your diet — too much bread, butter, sausage — it's evident even here." She gestured at the soiled bed. "It affects your health."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYjM2OTk5YzY1ODRjYjVhMzE3NzU4OTkwN2E0MWEx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Jesus Christ," Lorna hissed, feeling the mixture of frustration and lingering pleasure. Her heart pounded. “What’s it to you?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMmZhYjJkYjc5ODQ0NmRhOTMwZjU5OWI2N2ZiZDAw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"And, you've had intercourse with dozens of men and women. As such, the taste of your Aether is…excessively layered. I’ll need to clean the Svadavidhi after you depart." Kathrin said, her pupil-less eyes now locked onto Lorna, as if to see through her.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZjNhMGY2YjFjNDRmODk5ZTgxNzE4ZmUxODM2Yzlm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"That’s my shit…literally," Lorna mumbled, the absurdity of receiving dietary advice in the midst of such a scenario not lost on her. "You can’t get any Aether off that."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NGU4ZDJiNzY2ODRlMWViMmNmNjE2OWYzYzAyOWQ3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Perhaps not with your primitive Sol technologies," Kathrin continued, her eyes blinking twice. "but we Rakshasa know better. Aether flows through everything - your blood, bodily fluids, and waste all hold a unique signature that identifies you as an individual."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMTk3MTUwMTJhZjQ3OGNiNmVmODVkYTJlZmJiOTI0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna drew a deep, steadying breath, the remaining sensation of her ordeal ebbing away.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTVkZWI0YzQxZTQ2NWU5NThiOWYyZTI0ZmVkZjFm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Kathrin continued. "You must increase your water intake. It will improve your overall functions."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYTFjMTBmOWFmMTQ4NDNiNTdiZGM4MmY4ZjRjYjIx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The vines shifted, lowering Lorna's legs gently back down upon the verdant mattress. Her head rose, her eyes — deep wells of blue — looked over her own body. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkMWE3ODFjY2VkZjQyNmY4ZTUwMjhkZGVkYzAxNTcz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The golden forest of her pubic hair, tainted by excretion just a moment ago, lay bare and cleansed. It was as if the entire episode had been nothing but a fever dream, despite the lingering tingling in her muscles.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOWMwZmRkMWMxZDRkZWJiNDZkNGZjMmM1YzVhZGYx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Kathrin’s gaze fixed on a patch of skin near Lorna's collarbone that had gone translucent with stress, revealing the matrix of altered tissue glowing blue. "On a side note, the Nucleus Virus, in its dormant form, courses within you. Went intimate with someone outside your own species, perhaps?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOTRmMTAyZWY5ZDQ4YTg5ZjA2NWRmZTZlMDAxZDAz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna's fingers clawed into the bed of sentient vines. "I don’t want to say." she muttered.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDRkYWM5NzFjMjRmNzRhZWU2N2RiY2ZhYzczMTc1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">But then, a sharp throb pulsed through her stomach – something pushing against her from within. That was the third time this week.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOTNiZWNkNDZlMjQzMjI5NDc3ZDI1ZTY5YTlkZTQ3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">An idea came in her mind. With Kathrin's alien medical expertise right here, surely someone could tell her what it was. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyZmJmZjQ3Y2I2NTRjMjBiNDQ5MWQ2MzljYWVhNzM4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">But before she could say anything, the movement subsided. The moment to ask slipped away, and somehow, that felt deliberate – as if whatever was inside her didn't want to be discovered yet.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNmRhZTM2YjA5ODQ0ZTc4MDhmYTUxZTM0MzEzZGYw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Is it over?" Lorna asked in a hoarse voice, barely recognizable to herself. "Can I leave?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYmE0YTUzYmQ4NDQwYjk5YmJmZWViMDYwZWNiNGM5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Kathrin snapped her alabaster fingers. The verdant tendrils that had ensnared Lorna began to unfurl, releasing their grip. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkMmJhZGJjNTgyMDQzM2M4ODVmYzI0MjNjMDIwNGZj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Freedom. That was it. This was her only chance.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZTNkM2QwY2ExNTQxNzdiMTkzYmYzOGMzNzc0MTI0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The moment her limbs were free, Lorna exploded into action. She rolled sideways off the botanical bed, dropping into a fighter's crouch. Silver blue light blazed around her hands, poised to channel her first spell.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwM2I5ZDkzYTI5MjRmMjJhY2M5OTQxOTc4OWNmZTFh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Fulmen Argentum!" The incantation ripped from her throat as she hurled a bolt of lunar energy at Kathrin. The spell crackled through the air with silvery radiance.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOTI1ZmI3NmMxZDRjZmJiOWQ2ZTYyZmJkOGNlYzFk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Śūnyatā Śāntih." Kathrin didn't flinch as she chanted. With a lazy wave of her tentacles, she conjured a dark green psionic barrier that rippled.</span></p>
