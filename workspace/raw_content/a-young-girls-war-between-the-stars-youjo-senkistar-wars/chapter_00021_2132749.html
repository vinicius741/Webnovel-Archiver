<p class="cnM4YzEzNzBjNWY1YzQyYmFhNTA3OWVjYmFmN2EzMDlj" style="margin-bottom: 0">I looked up at the sound of the main hatch opening and a knock at the bulkhead. Reaching out, I felt a vaguely familiar presence in the Force and frowned. Leaning back in my magnetic chair, I found the blonde form of Satine Kryze poking her head into my ship and looking around.</p>

<p class="cnM1MmM1NGExODk5NjQ1MzdiOGE2N2VjODVmNGUyYzY4" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Can I help you?” I called, standing up from my workbench and the disassembled A-180 blaster laid out on it.</p>

There you are!” the woman smiled, her boots thumping on the deck as she made hr way over. “Obi-wan said you would probably be here. We haven’t had much of a chance to talk and with the negotiations almost complete, I felt it would be remiss of me not to take some time getting to know you.” She held out a hand to shake, “Please, call me Satine.”</p>

I focused on the compartment up front and pulled one of the chairs out, bringing it back and unfolding it for her, before sticking it to the deck. “Ah! Thank you,” she nodded, taking a seat and leaning forward, studying me intently. “Obi-wan is with Jango Fett today. Jaster and I swapped. And, well… I wanted to make sure you were doing better. I heard what happened with the Death Watch, and… <em>my sister</em><span style="font-style: normal">. I’m sorry.”</span></p>
