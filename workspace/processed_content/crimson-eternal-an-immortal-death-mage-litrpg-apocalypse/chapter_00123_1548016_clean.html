   As many of you no doubt know, the images hosted from Discord have broken across all of Royal Road. So I'm hosting them from Patreon now. Which isn't as good but it'll have to do. I'll also be making the Patreon post public that has these images in case the images here do break.

   to check out the Patreon post if these images ever break!
