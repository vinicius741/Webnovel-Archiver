   Epilogue
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  By the middle of September, things had settled back down into routines.
 </p>
<p>
  D.T. and Clark had things well in hand in the town of Oakwood. D.T. had looked into - and been able to take care of  - several of the minor problems that Clark had collected to be brought to my attention. Three of them had, in fact, just been pretty obvious plumbing problems making strange noises, which was a lesson to all of us - always check the plumbing before assuming that the rattle-thump sound is anything paranormal.
 </p>
<p>
  A fourth problem had turned out to be a clan of fairies living on the outskirts of town, dressed - and behaving - like echoes of the London Punk scene of the 1970's and 80's. Which, in turn, is proof that when the paranormal
  <em>
   is
  </em>
  involved, literally anything can happen.
 </p>
<p>
  With a bit of help from Wilbur the gnome and his clan in Oakwood, D.T. made peace with the fairies, and now had her own little clan sharing the police station with her. It had made for a highly entertaining story when D.T. told me all about it, and I was looking forward to meeting and opening talks between them and Faeflight.
 </p>
<p>
  Clark and the Oakwood gnomes had also made amazing progress on the social hall, allowing him to move the town offices over to its second floor well ahead of schedule. This freed up the two-story home on the other side of the church that he'd been using to store all of the files and where he'd kept his office, which Jessie immediately leased - after asking me if it was okay - for use by the UNSDI.
 </p>
<p>
  In order to avoid any appearance of favoritism (after Jessie became a citizen of Faeflight), Gabriel O'Connell himself had come out to Oakwood to meet with me about building relations between the Hall and the UNSDI. It had been a pleasant visit, cementing my desire to have a good working relationship with them. With a bit of help from Margrave, a very gentle mutual support deal between the UNSDI and Oakwood Hall was signed, and plans were made. Renovations on the house in town would take a couple of months, but after that Jessie would move into the small residence on the second floor there, and spend an occasional night in the surprisingly cozy little shelter she'd built in my clearing in Faerie.
 </p>
<p>
  Sheila Levin, my faculty advisor at Cambridge, came for her promised visit on the last Saturday in August. With a bit of work, and a few small exchanges of favors, I convinced all of the Fae in Oakwood and around the Hall to stay under cover for the day. I also convinced the Hall itself to present a completely mundane interior, with only the kitchen and my bedroom appearing the way they normally did.
 </p>
<p>
  The decisions that led there had taken a lot of soul searching and a long talk with Dara. At the end of the day, the bottom line was fairly simple: As much as I regretted effectively cutting my first real friend out of this part of my new life, she lived and worked far beyond my sphere of influence. If the ICOA decided to come for me, I wanted her as far outside the line of fire as possible.
 </p>
<p>
  It was a good day regardless. Sheila, upon seeing the splendor of Oakwood Hall itself - however mundane it appeared to her - and the roots I'd put down in Oakwood town, accepted my decision to stay without reservation. All she exacted in return was my promise to finish my master's degree, which was no trouble at all.
 </p>
<p>
  I gave her my thesis, and took from her the information about the two online classes (both of which I'd already done some of the course-work for, so they'd be a breeze). She headed home to Cambridge secure in the knowledge that she hadn't failed me either as a student, or as a friend. I watched her go, wondering if I'd ever have a chance to tell her everything.
 </p>
<p>
  Spice and Shine, meanwhile, had begun carefully expanding the defensive line of Faeflight into the woods surrounding my clearing, while Jessie and I were planning our first expedition into the surrounding territory to firm up Faeflight's borders. I'd never been interested in camping, not in any way, but listening to Jessie wax poetic about the dubious pleasures of roughing it at least had me looking forward to trying it.
 </p>
<p>
  Maths told me that walking the border of Faeflight - with a circumference of almost nineteen miles - shouldn't take more than a day or two, even if we took our time and accounting for dense woods. But Jessie warned me that it might take longer, due to the vagaries of Faerie and us running into who knew what. We invited D.T. to join us, but after explaining that the expedition would probably take at least a few days, maybe as much as a week, she'd hedged on her reply.
 </p>
<p>
  Not without good reason.
 </p>
<p>
  "You let me know when you firm up a date for your expedition," she'd said seriously, "and I'll see if I can get a few days off to go with. Don't get me wrong, I really want to, it sounds like an adventure…but I have responsibilities here that I can't walk away from without letting someone up the line know."
 </p>
<p>
  It was perfectly reasonable, so I tried not to feel like she was making an excuse. Our relationship was still young, and I was very new to the whole relationship thing, so my feelings were, I told myself firmly and quite rationally, a natural reaction, but not a valid one. D.T. did have responsibilities in town, and was beholden to her employers for time off. So I forced myself to let it go, and continued making plans with Jessie.
 </p>
<p>
  Part of which, at Ken's insistence, was making sure I had a working staff to take with me. So I turned much of my energy to fixing the rune arrays on Mom's failed staff.
 </p>
<p>
  In the end, I'd found eight small but significantly disruptive mistakes, spread out across all three pieces of the staff. Correcting those mistakes required a complex process of striking out the mistaken rune, using my nascent magical transfiguration skills to fill in the space, then etching a new, equally tiny but
  <em>
   correct
  </em>
  rune into the cleared space.
 </p>
<p>
  It was both difficult and time consuming. But I was determined; so I noted each of the mistakes, made the necessary structural corrections, then began etching the new runes.

<p>
  It took two weeks to make eight corrections.
 </p>
<p>
  I was finishing etching the last rune when Ken entered the workshop. "That was Margrave on the phone," he said, closing the door behind him. "He's filed an official, legal protest with the leadership of the International Consortium of Organized Arcana, accusing them of violating the terms of a Vassal agreement between the Reid family and a clan of dusk foxes. Copies of the filing have been sent to the UNSDI and several other international magical organizations, including both Sidhe courts, along with pictures of and a forensic examination of the remains of Garm's collar. You were right to try to save as much of it as you could. It's pretty damning."
 </p>
<p>
  "Good," I murmured, only half paying attention.
 </p>
<p>
  "The ICOA, in turn," Ken said, sounding amused, "protested that you had something to do with the arrest of two of their younger members in Newcastle. Something about charges of drunk and disorderly, indecent exposure, and possible psychological problems. Apparently, after they woke up they wouldn't stop babbling about being attacked by an army of fairies."
 </p>
<p>
  Perched on the rack of tools above my head, Sparkle giggled.
 </p>
<p>
  "Margrave says it took the ICOA a couple of weeks and a significant amount of money to bury the incident," Ken continued. "He also says they don't have the faintest piece of evidence to connect you to the incident. Neither of the men in question remember what they were doing when they were assaulted."
 </p>
<p>
  "Shine did good work," Sparkle said smugly. "It was Penny's idea to douse them in cheap beer when we dumped them in that alley, and Caley told us to strip them and dump their stuff in the trash at the last minute."
 </p>
<p>
  Penny was out in the clearing, working with Garm, so I made a mental note to tell her about Sparkle's appreciation of her trick. "Credit where credit is due," I said, "but don't ever admit to it outside of this room." Then I struck the last tiny adjustment to the rune I was etching on the aurite section of the staff.
 </p>
<p>
  I had, of course, saved the hardest part for last. The silver and copper strands had both been significantly easier to work with, both physically and magically.
 </p>
<p>
  But as I finished that last rune, I felt something similar to the sensation of the Master Key turning in one of the Hall's locks. Like gears finally moving smoothly, locking into place and working together. I could actually sense energy flowing smoothly through the segments and reaching out to one another.
 </p>
<p>
  As I sat back, all three sections of the staff, stretched out straight on the workbench in front of me, glowed softly in their respective colors - silver, coppery red, and gold - and quivered slightly. Then, to my astonishment, they slowly and carefully wound themselves back into their original triple-helix pattern. The loop-shaped end-cap screwed itself into place at one end, while the phoenix-shaped head did the same at the other end.
 </p>
<p>
  Then the whole thing straightened and grew solid, turning back into its intended staff form for the first time since my mother had changed it into its belt form. The end cap even changed shape from a loop to a cone shape.
 </p>
<p>
  It lay there on the workbench, humming contentedly at the edge of my magical senses, waiting for me to take it up and use it.
 </p>
<p>
  "Woah," I said softly.
 </p>
<p>
  "I was not expecting that," Ken agreed. "How does it feel? Carefully, mind you."
 </p>
<p>
  I nodded and laid my left hand gently on the staff. Instantly I could feel the humming of energy in and through it with crystal clarity. The discordant, nerve-jangling sensation it had when I first tried this was gone, replaced by a flow of energy so smooth and unhindered that it practically pulled at me and begged me to use it.
 </p>
<p>
  "It feels incredible," I said honestly. "Better than my original staff. By a pretty wide margin. Any power I channel through this is going to go easily and be dramatically enhanced. It's almost like it
  <em>
   wants
  </em>
  me to use it."
 </p>
<p>
  Ken nodded. "Good. That'll help you use less energy to achieve the same effects. Can you make it change shape?"
 </p>
<p>
  I barely had to give the concept intentional thought before it had gone limp beneath my hand. The conical base cap opened up again into a loop that could accept the spread wings of the phoenix-shaped topper, to act as a belt clasp.
 </p>
<p>
  "And back again?" Ken asked.
 </p>
<p>
  Again, I'd barely issued the mental instruction before the belt snapped back into a stiff, solid staff.
 </p>
<p>
  "Incredible," Ken said, then shook his head. "This is fantastic. I want you to keep it with you at all times when you go out…put it in a shoulder bag when you go jogging, if you have to…but keep it with you. That'll give you time to become attuned to it while you learn to use it, and you'll have it in case of emergency in the meantime. Caley, you have no idea how proud your mother would've been of you right now."
 </p>
<p>
  Above me, Sparkle sighed wistfully. "I remember when Mistress Chessie was making that. She said to me 'Someday, Sparkle, little Caley will find my feelings for her right here in this staff.'"
 </p>
<p>
  Ken and I swiveled our heads up to look at the little purple fairy, her legs dangling over the edge of the tool rack, elbows on her knees, chin propped in her hands.
 </p>
<p>
  "Sparkle," Ken said slowly, "do you know what she meant?"
 </p>
<p>
  Sparkle shook her head. "I don't understand it any better now than I did then. I just remembered. She said it while she was working out the rune arrays."
 </p>
<p>
  Ken and I looked at one another.
 </p>
<p>
  "The rune arrays," Ken said.
 </p>
<p>
  "The ones that were faulty," I said, my heart pounding.
 </p>
<p>
  I pushed the staff back on the table and unrolled the strips of parchment I'd copied the rune arrays onto, and had used to figure out how to 'fix' the staff. "A message in the runes?"
 </p>
<p>
  Ken shrugged. "Elder Futhark does translate into English, but it's not simple. And the rune alphabet you're using isn't really Elder Futhark, it just has that alphabet as its base. We might be looking for a phonetic translation, not a literal one."
 </p>
<p>
  "The mistakes," we said together. I quickly grabbed a fresh sheet of paper and a pencil, and wrote down the runes that had been placed 'wrongly' in the array. "You think she did this on purpose?" I asked as I copied them out. "That…what, she made this staff for
  <em>
   me
  </em>
  , not for herself?"
 </p>
<p>
  Ken shrugged. "Your mother occasionally displayed what might have been bursts of precognition, but they were intermittent and she didn't have any control over it. It's not impossible that she foresaw your need and…" He trailed off. "And created one of the most impressive pieces of material enchantment I've ever seen."
 </p>
<p>
  "But why break it?" I asked.
 </p>
<p>
  "So you wouldn't be able to use it until you could understand it?" Ken suggested, then shrugged. "Your mother could be very strange, Caley. I don't have all the answers, and we probably never will."
 </p>
<p>
  I slid the sheet with the 'wrong' runes on it over so he could see it clearly. After a moments of scribbling them in different orders, Ken suddenly said "Stop," blinked a few times and nodded, then reached up and wiped his eyes. "Yes, it's a phonetic translation."
 </p>
<p>
  I'd already called the rune alphabet to mind, and my brain was assigning sounds to the runes. My breath caught in my throat, and I suddenly found myself blinking through tears.
 </p>
<p>
  "What does it say?" Sparkle asked, fluttering down to land on my shoulder. "I was never good with mortal runes."
 </p>
<p>
  "It…" My voice broke, and I had to clear my throat. "It says, 'I love you.'"
 </p>
<p>
  "That's all?" Sparkle asked, as if she'd been expecting the secrets of the universe to be revealed.
 </p>
<p>
  I smiled. "That's everything," I said quietly, laying my fingers on the staff again and feeling its warm, welcoming hum. "Everything that needed to be said. I love you too, Mom."
