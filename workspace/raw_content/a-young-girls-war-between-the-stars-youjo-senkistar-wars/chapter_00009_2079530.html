<p class="cnNlNmEyMjM5YmYwOTRlNzNiN2U3ODAyZjM5NWRlMzU0" style="margin-bottom: 0">The next morning, I woke early and made my way outside, finding a spot of open ground nearby to work in. After stretching out and doing a few exercises to warm up, I settled into practicing with my lightsaber, falling into the familiar pattern of strikes as I worked on the basics as Obi-wan had taught me.</p>
<p class="cnM0NGIzMjFhODljYjQzYjhhZWVkYjhmY2NkZmViOTVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMzZGJiNjc0NjI1ZDQ4YmU4Y2I0NGQ5MjY4ZGIxNjcy" style="margin-bottom: 0">I felt and saw an older woman approach, stopping at the edge of the area where I was training. “I’ve been informed you’ll be joining us.”</p>
<p class="cnM1N2ZiMThhNTc5YzQyYWQ4MjE3N2FhNjQ3NDgwMjE1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM2MjI4ZGNiMTA5MzRhOThiNzdjNmQzM2VjMjc4MGQy" style="margin-bottom: 0">Finishing out one last strike, I shut off the lightsaber and stuck it on my belt before turning to the newcomer. “Yes. Your clan mother extended the invitation to me. I’ll be in your care.”</p>
<p class="cnM3ZjdjOTZlYmUxMTQwYzA4YTBkZWFjMmQwODk4OTlj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM5ZWQzMmJlNWQ1YTRlNDdiN2Y4YjM5YzJhMDkyMTgz" style="margin-bottom: 0">The woman nodded and waved for me to follow. “I am the captain overseeing training of the children. You can address me as captain or leader. We rise with the sun. You’ll start every morning by coming to the trail head,” she instructed, picking up into a jog as I ran along behind her. “The trail is an obstacle course and splits into three paths, marked with red, blue, and purple markers. Red is for beginners. Blue is for those of intermediate skill level and will require a certain level of mastery over both your body and the Force. Purple is for those who have a mastery of both their bodies and the Force. You will start on the red path for today and I will follow to evaluate your progress. Do you understand?”</p>
<p class="cnMzNTE3OWRjODA4ZjRiMDJiNWY4NWI0ZjU5MzAyNGIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNlMGFkM2NiMDA1NzQ5NjBiZDVmMzI2YjcyNGIwOTY2" style="margin-bottom: 0">“I do, captain.”</p>
<p class="cnNiYTc0NWY2MTZlNDQxNjY4NmExZGZiZWQzNmVkZDEw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMxN2U5OTM1MzUzMTRlMDc4NzljOTkzOWI3ODJhYWE2" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Mm,” she slowed as we approached a trail marked off with an archway, from which dangled ribbons of red, blue, and purple cloth. “Follow the trail around the mountain back to the village. After which, we’ll have breakfast. Then, we hunt. Go. I’ll be behind you.”</p>
<p class="cnM2YmI5Y2Y0YjE5ODQ2ODg4MjhhMGNjODdkMzNlZmQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM1YzRmNzM4ZjRmNTRhMGE5YmVlN2JhY2E4MDcxYTlh" style="margin-bottom: 0">Nodding, I took off down the path at a run. It wasn’t long at all before the trail split off, with red strips on the left path and blue and purple to the right. I broke left, following the trail through the forest. Soon enough, I came across the first obstacles—ropes tied across the trail in a web-like pattern, but little more than hurdles. Hurdles to normal people, anyway. I hopped on top of the first line, moving with the swaying of the rope as it held my weight and jumping to the next, and the next. Sure, it used the Force a bit, but that was its own form of training.</p>
<p class="cnNmYjBlOTdmYmFmYTRhOGViNzVjNThkMGVmOGM2NmJm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMzZDRhNjA3MWVhZTQ5NGNiMTk5YzQ1MzQwMGY0OTE1" style="margin-bottom: 0">The next obstacle was a series of logs that had been planted vertically between ground level and a ledge several yards above, where the trail continued. They were barely wide enough to step on with one foot and looked sturdy enough, but the path up was pretty obvious. A fall wouldn’t be fatal, just painful, and it would require starting over. I leapt onto the first and, keeping my momentum, skipped up the path, grabbing onto the tops of poles and pulling myself up where I couldn’t quite make the jumps.</p>
<p class="cnM3OTJiZmQxM2RhNjRlMDA4Y2M0YjJmMDI5YzNlOTQy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMwYjc1ZTc5YjkwNzQ1ZDJhMGViNjJhMWY4YzQyNTUy" style="margin-bottom: 0">The next challenge was a series of balance beams over a shallow mud puddle, clearly one of those ‘fall in and start over’ challenges. I flew by that and moved onto a set of hanging wooden poles—bamboo or something like it—that required me to swing across, catch the next one, and repeat that several times before crossing to the other side. I couldn’t quite make the jump to catch the first, but a kick off of the pole it was suspended from let me catch it and swing myself over.</p>
<p class="cnM3YjFlMjJiN2FiYzRlNWRiZWM2NmYxZDAxNTlkNjVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMyZGRjMDE4NDFhZjQwM2ViNTFmMGQ4ODU0MDg3ODBj" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Why don’t you use the Force to move yourself?”</p>
<p class="cnNjNDM4OWE1ZjgwYjQ4YjE5MWY2NGI1YzNiMDY1Mzc3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM0NjI5YmU0Yzc0OTRkMWY4OWFmNWJkNGNlNDgzY2U5" style="margin-bottom: 0">I nearly landed face first on the dismount as the captain landed beside me and her voice interrupted the focused, almost meditative state I’d fallen into. Sending her a curious look, I answered, “I do for some things.”</p>
<p class="cnNkZjM4NmNiNjg2NjQwMjNhZjY4ZWVjNTgzMDIxZDY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMzNzdjMjYyZTQxNzQ0ZGFiYWY2MTg0NTA0Mjc0YWIy" style="margin-bottom: 0">“I’ve noticed. You use it mostly for balance and timing,” she pointed out, and I nodded. “You don’t use it to increase your strength or speed. We could be nearly finished by now if you did. So I ask again, why don’t you?”</p>
<p class="cnNmNDgzOTdhNDJjYzRlMzY4NmQwYWE1OTgyOTgwMjZi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNkMjU3YTEwMDI4MzQ1MTRiMTg0YTVhMTM0ODIzYmU1" style="margin-bottom: 0">Confused, I slowed to a jog as I answered. “That would defeat the point, wouldn’t it? The Force is a force multiplier when it comes to physical enhancement. Simplifying it a lot, if you can lift one hundred pounds without it then with it you can lift two to three hundred. If you train to lift one-fifty without, you could lift three hundred to four-fifty with. But if you use it full time to lift two hundred pounds, you only maintain, not increase what you can lift.”</p>
<p class="cnNjMjQ4N2QxMDFjMDRiODVhMDA5ODI2OTNiYTEzYWFh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMxZWZkMTAxYjM5NTQ2ZTBiNmMxYzg2Yjg5MGE2NTNi" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Ahh,” the older woman murmured, nodding. “Yes, you could look at it like that. <em>However</em><span style="font-style: normal">, the alternative to your little example is to </span><em>just lift more</em><span style="font-style: normal">. Run more. Practice more. Do more. That way, not only are you training your body, but also training with the Force. Then, it comes naturally to you. So, instead of using it bringing a sudden surge of strength and leaving you momentarily out of sorts and having to adjust, you’ve adjusted to it over time. You’re comfortable with it and with your body. You use it in everything you do. You don’t crack a cup just by holding it, but at the same time you can punch your fist through a stone </span><span style="font-style: normal">wall. </span><span style="font-style: normal">Your physical condition is important, but using the Force is more important. It shouldn’t come as </span><em>second</em><span style="font-style: normal"> nature, or like using a new limb, it should be as natural </span><span style="font-style: normal">and without thought or effort</span><span style="font-style: normal"> as breathing.”</span></p>

<p class="cnM4OWExNTk3NjE0OTRkODdiM2VjNTQ5OGI0NDdmOGIy" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMxN2I3NWMyZDQ0NTQzZGQ4MjJkNjczODhlYzgwYzdk" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">The brunette smiled. “It is.”</p>

<p class="cnNhMTJhYTE1OTJmODRhODI5NGNlYmI3NWUyYWM1OTUz" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal">She chuckled. “Things are placed just out of reach, just slightly beyond their ability to jump to, to encourage them to use the Force. This course is meant to lay the foundation for the sort of physical skills </span><span style="font-style: normal">and casual Force use</span><span style="font-style: normal"> we </span><span style="font-style: normal">use</span><span style="font-style: normal"> every day to hunt and protect the village. </span><span style="font-style: normal">You are just physically exceptional enough to not need to use it for the majority of things.”</span></p>

<p class="cnM0ZmViZTdkMWU4YTQ4NmQ5MmRiZWQ1NmJlMTQxMTYy" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<span style="font-style: normal">And when they can run the course in an acceptable time frame, they move up to the next,” I guessed, and she nodded. “I see.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTQ2NzcwOGZlNjRlYWViYWIzZjVlNjEyZjZhYzBj" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>

At first, I almost face-planted as I found I couldn’t keep up. Then, after a few moments, my mind and perceptions caught up and it felt like I was moving at a normal run. The difference was, I could feel the momentum of my motion, the energy in every step as I didn’t so much run as sprung or leapt between steps, clearing yards between each step. The rest of the course, I spent relearning my limits and adjusting to what would become my new normal.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YjMxODJiNmI1NTRlOGM5YmQ4N2QxMDA0ZDBkNzBl" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNlYTcwNWE2ZDdjNzQyNTQ4NGQ5NjQ2ZmRlODcwMWY5" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">When we finally made it back to the village, the captain led me to a communal mess hall, where we loaded up plates and sat down to eat. I felt the stares of everyone in the hall and more than a few less than subtle probes with the Force that I smacked away. As I began eating, the captain asked, “I heard you killed a rancor yesterday.”</p>
<p class="cnMxOWJhNTlhMDcwYTRjNWJhZWRmMDU4OGI4MTg5ZjBi" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMzMTAwNWY0ZTgyYjQxMmM4Y2QwZTgzMDUwN2Q3YzZl" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">It wasn’t a question, but I nodded in answer. “Yes. I wasn’t expecting to find an animal that’s actually resistant to a lightsaber.”</p>
<p class="cnMzNGEwZDJkMTQ1YTQ5NjhiNjI0NWVjYzgxZmI2NTQ4" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM0MTZiYjdiNzRiNDQzY2E4ODcwYTg2ZDNiMDY0NzNl" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">“They’re tough,” she agreed, studying me. “You told me that before today, you weren’t increasing your strength or speed with the Force?”</p>
<p class="cnMzY2Y5ODIwNTExZDRmZWE5Njg2ODFmNWNjMGZkMzA5" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NTllY2ViNGRmYjQ5MTdiNmVkYzg3NDA5NjI1ZjNi" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">“Correct,” I confirmed. I had used other techniques a few times, as the situation called for it, but, “Generally, I only use it to enhance perception, for balance, or precognition.”</p>
<p class="cnM4MjBhNjI4ZGYzNDRhZDA4Zjc3OGQxZDg5YjZiNjBh" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM3MjJkMTBlZTRiZTRhZjFhMWY3ZmEzN2RhMWEwODQ1" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<span style="font-style: normal">Then you took down the rancor with just the strength of your own body.”</span></p>

<p class="cnM5OWQwOWJiMzUzMDQ5ZGE5YzQ3ZTU5OGNkNTIzYzcz" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">I nodded. “I used the Force to throw my lightsaber there at the end, but yes. Why?”</p>

I followed along </span><span style="font-style: normal">and raised an eyebrow as they began collecting bows, stringing them, and putting on quivers full of arrows. They followed that up with sturdy looking leather backpacks.</span></p>

<p class="cnMwMWMwYTlmNWEzYTRkNWNiOTA0Njg4NTc1ODg2ZTMy" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">I shrugged and followed the others out. They took off down a trail leading down from the mountain, to a series of vines that had been woven together and tied off using boulders as anchors. I watched as they jumped onto the large vine and slid down, a few of them taking shots at large birds as they passed, using the Force to guide arrows to strike, then bringing back the arrow and bird and slipping the prey into their bags.</p>

<p class="cnM0NTAyZjdjYWRhNTQ3YTNhOGI4MGNlOTkwM2ViMmUz" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">The Force kept me upright as I began sliding down, the wind whipping at my hair and clothes, and a grin pulled at my lips as I enjoyed the closest thing to flight I’d felt in a while. Spotting one of the birds the others were taking down, I pulled an arrow and drew, reaching out with the Force to predict where it would be and the flight of the arrow, before loosing. A small explosion of feathers announced a hit and I jerked it back in with the Force, catching the arrow and working the now limp bird off into the bag over my shoulder, and nearly losing it in the process since I couldn’t quite tell where the lip of the bag was.</p>

Opening myself up, I felt for animals as we went and took my cues both from the Force and the others on what to shoot and what to let pass as I worked to fill my bag. When we passed over a stream, I took a moment to spear a few fish the same way and add those to the pile.</p>

The trek back left my legs burning, but it was the good kind of burn. When we returned, the kids all dropped their bows and arrows off where we’d gotten them before, before dropping the bags off at another hut, where I could smell blood and other not so great smells thick in the air.</p>

The sun had already fallen behind the mountains and it felt like the whole village had gathered to watch as we swept across one of the training fields, his blue lightsaber clashing with my silver-white in a series of rapid clashes that flashed over the surroundings.</p>

Feeling more than seeing the big, slowly rotating floating rocks above me, I timed my leap, judged the windage, then jumped. The Force propelled me upwards and my hand slapped the rock, a bit of telekinesis in the form of a pull briefly sticking it to its surface, before I adjusted, aimed for the next one, and kicked off, repeating the process until I made it to the biggest floating rock.</p>

Studying them, they looked like they were likely parts of an asteroid that had fallen to the planet at some point. I couldn’t readily identify the metal, but it practically glowed with Force. Slipping it into my pack, I took a running leap and jumped. Full on <em>flight</em><span style="font-style: normal"> was still beyond me, being that the flight formula was too expensive to use for more than a couple of seconds at a time, but </span><em>gliding</em><span style="font-style: normal"> was actually surprisingly easy.</span></p>

Touching down lightly just outside Augwynne’s home, I headed inside and pulled out the chunk of metal, passing through the leather curtain separating the library and placing the piece of metal on her desk.</p>

If it was a boy, Dooku would take him to raise elsewhere, away from the problems of Dathomir society and their treatment of their own men—as even with his help, they had yet to come up with a workable solution to the issue that didn’t end in civil war or take more than three generations to see through. If it was a girl, Augwynne would keep her, to raise as her successor and one of the Witches of Dathomir.</p>

Knowing what I did of the Jedi order and their thoughts on <em>attachments</em>, this was going to end poorly. Either way, I would be keeping my mouth shut. I knew the value of secrecy and master Dooku had helped me more than once. I felt like I owed him a favor or two.</p>

Feel free to use whatever else you want to while you’re there. </span><span style="font-style: normal">To get in, you need to look under the starboard wing, where it’s dipping into the water.

For the not so casual observer, I closed off my mind, making sure none of my emotions or thoughts would leak while at the same time cranking up my sensitivity so I could make sure nothing was following or observing me. </span><span style="font-style: normal">Then, I reached inside myself, to my presence within the Force, and drew it all inward—mimicking the stealth techniques I had learned for hiding mana in my last life.

The design was honestly not what I was expecting for a space ship, let alone some kind of flying Jedi academy. For one thing, it was <em>flat</em>. I had no idea why they chose a flat design when a thicker, three dimensional design would have given them much more area to work within—especially if they never intended to land the thing. Space docks were common, so it wasn’t like they ever needed to take it down into a planet’s atmosphere to have it worked on if it needed maintenance or repairs.</p>

Moving along the bank under it, I quickly found the access hatch I had been told about—hidden behind some bushes that didn’t quite look like they belonged given that they were typically found near the mountain, not near water like this. They also felt to my senses as though they had been encouraged to grow using some Force technique—likely one of the ‘spells’ the tribe used.</p>

Even enhancing one’s strength, speed, durability and so on with the Force fell under the umbrella of <em>an application of telekinesis</em>.</p>

The entire thing was tilted a few degrees off, so it was like walking uphill as I followed Augwynne’s instructions towards the forge area. Just as she had said, as soon as I entered the proper area, the emergency lights came on and I was able to follow the signage to the forge.</span></p>

The room was meticulously clean, with several different machines all placed around it and storage lockers containing different materials and even some completed parts for lightsabers. Examining the equipment, I found not </span><em>just</em><span style="font-style: normal"> a forge, but also an interface for designing custom parts and a fabricator to take whatever materials were put in and use them to make whatever design had been put in.</span></p>

The crystal, I set on the design table for now, while I put the songsteel into the forge and quickly set it to melt it down into bars. I watched for a few moments as force fields engaged and the forge quickly heated up, scanners analyzing the metal, determining its melting point, and bringing it up to temperature before the force fields began working on it.</p>

Cracking my knuckles, I considered the interface and what I wanted. I had been considering it for a while, but now I believed I finally had the means to produce what I wanted—and out of such a high quality, Force enriched material no less. I couldn’t pass up the chance.</p>
