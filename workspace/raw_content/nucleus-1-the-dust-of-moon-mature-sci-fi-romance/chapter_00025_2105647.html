<p class="cnMxNzJlOTA2NGFjYzRhNDNiZjk0NmNlODJhM2Y2OTMz"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Terminal 4, Songnei Starport (松內星港), No. 340-9, Dunhua North Road, Songshan District, Taipei, Taiwan, Imperium of Dragons territory</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNzM3YWE1YzJkZjRlMmRhOWE4YjMyZWY2N2IyZjg5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><span style="font-weight: 400">"</span><span style="font-size: 1.5em"><strong>F</strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400">uck off!" Lorna barked. In one fluid motion, she drew Baldr, her trusty Psytum Sword. The blue energy blade shot out from its hilt, its resonance syncing with the adrenaline that spiked in her veins. </span></span></p>
<p class="cnM0N2JlMDFhNmExMDQ3ZDRhNzhmNzZkMzdjZTQ2NjMx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her Psi Shield, a sleek silver device that looked like a small earphone with an earhook, was perched on her left ear. Aside from being connected to her team's voice comm, it emitted a soothing hum as it generated a quantum blue energy barrier around her, protecting her from harm and deflecting any minor damage that came her way.</span></span></p>
<p class="cnMyZjVkZGEzNGM3ZjRmMjZiODJiODY5YmVkZDdiMTRj"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Three Skuggrs, insectoid creatures with brown carapaces, flanked the Bone Fiends and spat corrosive bile at them in hopes of dissolving their flesh. But Lorna's blue energy bubble kept the acid at bay, turning it into harmless mist upon contact.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDc3NzBkMTBmMTQyZDg4MWVmNmVmOTQ1NTc5ODM3"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">As Lorna dispatched the monsters one by one, civilians scattered in fear and fled the area.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYTJhM2NiZDFlMjRjYzU4ZGE0MGNlOTUwMGUyMGEx"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Lorna, amiga," Diego's urgent voice cut through the chaos, breaking through Lorna's earpiece in her right ear amidst the battle. "Xin told me you're going after Skarn. You need to abort that."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNDRkMGNhYzVmNjRhZDc5MTExMDkwNDliZTVkYjY1"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"I can't," she replied with a growl as she swung her sword, Baldr, cutting into the belly of a Skuggr and spilling its insides. Her blonde ponytail, held high on her head, whipped behind her like a banner of war. "Skarn just escaped from Amber Moon. It's the perfect time to take him down while he's weakened."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOWQ1ZDllYTU1MDQxNTFiODk0MTYxOWVjYjNkOThl"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Amiga, you can't possibly think you can defeat Skarn alone!" Diego's usually calm voice was now filled with panic.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MjNhOWZjMDMzODRmNGM5MWJlMzgxZTcxOWZkYzBh"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"I never got the chance to avenge the loss of my homeland," Lorna's sapphire eyes were now burning with tears of rage. "But today, I will."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZGM2NmMxN2VmZDRhNTY4OWI2MjllZjFiYTdiMjUx"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Please, calm down. Let's regroup and bring this information back to Director Otis. We'll come up with a plan together —" Diego's voice came through her earpiece.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMTBmZjEwNzUwZjRlOGVhODU2MDAzYzRhMGJkYzIw"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Sorry, Diego. I have to do this," Lorna said, reaching up to tap on the cool surface of her Psi Shield, turning off her earpiece with her left hand while wielding Baldr with her right.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NTRhZWUxMTQwMTQ3Mzc5OWI5NDM3ZjU0MGU1NTc5"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">With determination, fear, and courage driving her forward, she continued on, her Psytum Sword shining like a supernova in her hand.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Y2ZiMGZhZGZkMTRlODk4OWY0MDk2Mzg4ODQyYTZi"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">The scent of ozone and burnt blood mingled in the air. Lorna parried and thrusted as she cut through a pack of frenzied Bone Fiends.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZjMwNDk0OWVmNDQwZTlhMzM1MmFhYTRmZjI2MDE5"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">A massive beast resembling a mutated octopus emerged, itts dark brown body floating in the air. In front of it stood three Bone Fiends, their mouths dripping with saliva.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYmM1ZjA5ZTc4YjQ3MGM5NTdjMTg5YjYzNzBkM2U4"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">The Kraken spoke in a deep voice. "You are alive, Lorna Weiss. Lord Skarn shall be most pleased."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYWZhNDE3YzgwODQ5NjFiMjVkMTI2YjRhOTU2ZjQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna's left hand hovered over her trench coat pocket as she faced the Radi-Mon. "Back off, Kraken. You don't want to fight me."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNjk1ZTVhZTlhMzQ3MzNiMDNiZGE5M2MyYzU5ZTJm"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">The creature laughed in amusement. "I do not have to. My minions will take care of you after I weaken you." With that, it spewed out a pile of putrid green goo in Lorna's direction.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2N2Q3NmJmYzRjMjQxMjg5YmJhMDQ1ZjBlNTE0NjMw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><span style="font-weight: 400">But Lorna was quicker. As the Kraken released its goo, she chanted an incantation under her breath. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">"Passus Transitus!"</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></span></p>
<p class="cnMwYzE5ZDQzODZlZjQ5MDk5NjlhYWMxZjI3MWU4Y2Fj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><span style="font-weight: 400">In an instant, she teleported one meter to the side, narrowly avoiding the attack.</span></span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTJjNzlhOWZiODQwOWRiNTI1NDkzYjRhNDQ5NjUw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><span style="font-weight: 400">With her left hand, Lorna drew Váli, her 10mm Magnum, and aimed at the monster. Focusing her psionic energy, she chanted before firing a bullet, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">"Glacies Lunae Fulgur!"</span></em></span></p>
<p class="cnM0NWYyMzJhYWIyMTQ5MmE4N2UwOGU4MDA4NGJjMjk2"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">The bullet transformed into a large blue ball of energy and flew towards the Kraken. As it struck the creature's flesh, it exploded in a dazzling display of light and sound.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDRiNjU3NjczOTRkMzY5NzZjNmM0ZDg3YzlhNzM1"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">The Kraken screamed in agony as its flesh began to disintegrate into blue piles of ash. The explosion also caught the Bone Fiends under the Kraken's control, obliterating them completely.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NGJiY2U0OTU3YzQ4ZGJhZGQyZTNiOWUxZTM5M2Fi"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna tucked Váli back into her pocket and took a moment to catch her breath, kneeling down on one knee. Casting psionic spells through her pistol may have amplified their power, but it also drained more Aether from her than usual.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNzM2ZDNlNTExOTQ5YTU4MjliZjk4YThlNDAxNTIx"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"*Frykt ikke mørket,*" she whispered as she stood up and continued forward, her beige trench coat billowing behind her and her black military boots clicking on the floor.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNWIyNzQwY2Y4ODQ1ZTBhMzM0NzkwOTdiNGQyNDdi"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">She didn't flinch as she encountered more Radi-Mons. A pair of Skuggrs descended upon her, their antennae whipping. Lorna drew her sword once more and moved like a specter through their ranks, her blade a blur of blue quantum energy that left dismembered limbs and brown shells in its wake.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzM2ExMTExM2M0NDQwNGE5ZDRhNTI3Mzk5MDkxZWMz"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"*Dere skal alle til helvete!*" Lorna hissed with contempt.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZDYzNzAwOTQxOTQxYzY4M2ViNWFhMjMzOGU1MzRj"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">With a final, sweeping arc of her sword, the last of the Skuggrs fell, leaving only the sound of sickening screeches. Lorna pushed on, her blue eyes ablaze with determination.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OGZhYjA5NzdlMjQ4NmU4ZmJmZGY3YWI5ZjYzNzA3"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">And then, there he was: Skarn, the false promise of her people’s salvation, and the embodiment of her nightmares, standing amidst the carnage like a deity, a towering figure in a metallic exoskeleton, strode confidently through the ranks of basic security guards belonging to the Imperium. Their futile attempts at stopping him were met with bullets bouncing harmlessly off his armor, accompanied by thermal blades scraping in futility.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YmIxY2YwNGExODRlZDU4NmU5ZWUzY2E5NTkzY2Ix"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">With each step, the creature’s massive claws sliced through flesh and bone, leaving a trail of crushed bodies. The sound of shattering bones and splattering blood came as he plowed through his enemies. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4YzBlYzI0MzY4NTRkOGM5MTI2YzQ2NzJhMmQyZWVl"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">The once pristine floor was now stained with a gruesome mixture of brains, bones, and flesh.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZGNmMjRjMTZiYjQ1MmQ4OTNiMjdjZDMyZGQwMGIw"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">His mottled skin beneath the brown exoskeleton was intimidating as he turned, his red eyes locking onto hers with a predatory glint.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYTg0MTlhZGYwZTQ1NTE4N2FmNjY3ZGRiODAzNzM4"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Skarn," Lorna spat out his name.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMWI4M2Y5NmY5MjQwZDU5NjM2N2I4MmQ1Njc2OTVj"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Sigrún. You're alive," Skarn sneered, his twisted mouth forming a grotesque smile as he recognized Lorna. It had been many years since anyone had called her by that name. "Change your appearance and take on new identities all you want, but I'll always recognize your fragrance."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OGU1YWRmOWNmNTRhZmQ4YmUwYWVjZjk1ZGYxYmFk"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Where’s my father?" Lorna challenged, taking a step towards him.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YzczOTQ3MzdiYTQ4NTRiZjgxNDIwYzY5YjVmN2Yw"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"I've missed you, Sigrún," Skarn spoke in a low growl. "Must our dying people fight amongst ourselves? Until we're all extinct?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMjYwMjk1ZmM4NTRhNzE5NmUyZGVjMTFkOThlODRi"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna's grip tightened around the hilt of Baldr.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNzQ4NWIyM2IxODRmYzY5NmQ4NjQ4ODk3YjQzMTJk"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"You are the reason our homeland was destroyed," she said in a steely voice. "If you and Ysolde hadn't used the Nucleus Virus, the Imperium and the Alliance would have never invaded Scandinavia."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MTQ5YzQzMTMyNDQ5NjdiODlkNmUzNTM0YTlmMjY1"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Lies, Sigrún!" Skarn snarled, five gigantic tentacles connected to his lower torso writhing behind him like serpents. He raised his hands, sharp with long claws. "But that matters little. I have acquired the very power to dominate the Universe – and those such as yourself."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkN2NlYTRiMDg2MjRhZWU4YzI5MmQ1OWI2NWNiZDM4"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"You’ll die today!" Lorna declared, channeling her psionic energy. The space between them crackled with unseen forces as they circled each other, two Nordilngs ready to clash.</span></p><span class="cjM1Y2IzMGM5NzRlNDQwMGI5ZDI2MTIxY2VmZjUwNDYw"><br/>Unauthorized tale usage: if you spot this story on Amazon, report the violation.<br/></span>
<p class="cnMyNDk5OGQ3NWUwNTQxMGRhYTUxM2ZhOTQ5MDEzMTM1"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">And then, with fury, Lorna charged, her muscles coiling and uncoiling like springs. Baldr, her Psytum Sword, hummed with resonance.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwY2VmYzIxYWIzZDRhNWZiMjI5YzM3NTdlMzE2MmI2"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Skarn's massive claws swept with surprising speed. His tentacles lashed out, one narrowly missing Lorna's head while another grazed her leg.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OWJkMTQxNzg4MjRjODA5YmZkMzQ0MzUzODdmODk4"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna dodged through Skarn's onslaught, each movement like ballet.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Zjg4ZGRlY2E1MTQ5MDRiYjQ1ZTc3MjVhMzIzMTJk"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Is that fear I taste in your sweat, Sigrún?" Skarn's voice was guttural as he swung his limbs.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MWYyMmU2YjlhYzRlNjhiZTYxYjk2ZDk4Y2E2Mjcw"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Where is my father, Skarn?" Lorna spat back, a smirk slicing her lips as she raised Baldr high. "You know where Harald is. Tell me!"</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZjgyMTgxNjI0MzRlODE4Nzg5N2M4NjJiYjY0YmM5"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Harald Omdal exists beyond your reach now, Sigrún," Skarn replied, his voice booming. He loomed larger. "He walks a path where neither you nor I can follow. Not yet."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZmU4ZThhZWUzNDRiNzI4ZWY0ZmE2NDMxZmMyNzZl"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"What did you do to him?" Lorna's breath hitched.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYWFlMmM0MjAyZTQyZjM5ZjdkYTJjMWY1NGJmNmVl"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Her fingers tightened around Baldr's hilt, the Psytum pulsating in tandem with her rising psionic energy.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MjgwZjA1ZjhlMDQwMGQ4MjE4M2NhOWMzYTUzZTlh"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Does it matter?" Skarn said simply, tilting his monstrous head.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OTY1NDNlMjFmYzRkOWE4MTQ4MWQzMTI4MzhmMjAx"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Fine, I'll just hit you harder," she declared through the din of battle.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYzI0MGE5NTMxNDRmMTViNGUxYzk1YmVhN2I5ZDUw"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">The sword sliced through the air. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0YTkwYmMxZWVmNDQwNWY4YzNmZTE4MmZlZGRiZDky"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">In the known world, Skarn was impervious to harm from most human weapons. Even powerful siege tank cannons were no match for him. But a Psytum Sword — powered by its wielder's own heartbeat and infused with psionic energy — could cut through anything, limited only by the wielder's mental state. The more determined and focused the master, the more devastating her blade became.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNmQxMWNiNTQ4NjQ1NWJhNmQ3OGE4MGViMTIyN2Rh"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">With fury, Lorna struck, carving gashes into Skarn's exoskeleton, blue energy searing his flesh.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MjE4ODAxNGJjNDRmYTg5MmRkMzAxN2NhODQ0NDQw"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">The wounds should have been mortal, and on any other day, they would have been. But something was amiss.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOTlhNmUxNTlhZjQ3YTZhM2NkZDk1MTE5NDMxNGE2"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna's blue eyes narrowed as she watched the sinew and skin knitting itself back together. Where there had been gaping cuts seconds ago, now only faint scars remained.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTRiODU2ZmIwMTRjOWI4YzJiNzdiZjk0YTVhNDdj"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna leapt forward once more, attacking relentlessly. Each strike aimed with precision, yet each time the blade met flesh, Skarn's wounds sealed shut with a grotesque efficiency.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NTg4ZmZhZDk3NzRjYWY4M2EwZmQ3M2Y5MTA0ZTNh"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Did the Imperium of Dragons not tell you?" Skarn taunted. "Their finest engineers toiled to weave cybernetic sinew beneath my skin." He flexed. "I am reborn, beyond the reach of death."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4M2EyYzllYjg3MDQzZTM4YzhjOGIyMjU5ODUzZTM3"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">The revelation struck Lorna like a physical blow, her next swing desperate. The tentacles and cables protruding from Skarn's form pulsed. "They did this."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OTY4MGIzZTYzNjQ4Y2ViNmRkZmNlODgwMTk5OWY3"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Their Emperor thought he could control me and use me to crush the Alliance," Skarn said with a deep chuckle. "I should pay him a visit soon."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNzM3N2I4MzI4ZDQ4Zjk4Mjg0NGM5Mjc0NjA4YWZk"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"You’re invincible," she said, her mind racing. Her confidence began to crumble.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMmY4MjliMTNiZTQwYWY5ZjUwYjY2YjViMTkwMTVl"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"As I always am," Skarn advanced, his red eyes gleaming. "Your toy is not enough today."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMTBjZDcxNjIxNDQyNzk5MTU2NmMxYjZjZWY5MTFh"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Her backpedaling steps were measured, her icy gaze locked onto his.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYWU1ZmExY2ZiODQyMzBhYmQ3NjNjODdjMzkyOWNh"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"I’ll still take you down," she managed, though her voice wavered. "Then my people will find the Moondust Crystal, and your Fenris Horde will fall."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNWFjZGEwYTUxMDQ1MDdhYjVkMTYwMmVmNjIxNTMx"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"‘My people’? Is that what you call those lesser races these days?" Skarn taunted. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkM2Y2ODE3YjczMjRkZDJiMDI5MWY1ZTlmOTJmOWUz"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">With every parry and thrust, Lorna's movements grew more frantic, her heart beating more desperately.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MDk2MWVkNDlhZjRlODdiYWNkZGI2ZmZjMzMxN2Zl"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Long have I waited, Sigrún. This consummation," Skarn bellowed, his tendrils whipping the air like serpents.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OTE5NzBlNjczNDQyOTA5NDkyMDE3MzI3MDk5NzEy"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"What," Lorna whispered to herself, a lifeline pulling her from the dark abyss. She would not yield to fear, but the confusion caught her off guard. "What are you doing…"</span></p>
<p class="cnNjY2I0MDBhZWYyZTQ3YmViZTU4MmY2MzI2NDIwZTk4"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">In that moment, malignant coils encased Lorna, Skarn's dark tentacles constricting like pythons around her limbs. Her Psytum Sword clattered to the ground, deactivated as Skarn raised her into the air with his appendages.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmY2E1YzhhZWExMDQyNTViMzIyNjZmMmYxOTk2OTVm"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Be still," he sneered, a tentacle writhing lasciviously, its tip morphing something akin to genitalia. It coiled around her, seeking purchase against the fabric of her suit. Another appendage slithered under her turtleneck, tracing the curve of her collarbone with abhorrent fascination.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MzhhYTFkZDIzMTRiMDZhNWQyNjI2MDJjY2VlNmU1"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">A third appendage oozed a thick white liquid, pressing against her lips, attempting to enter her mouth. In defiance, Lorna clenched her jaw tight.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZDE2MzUwZGUwMDRiMDc4NmJkOWFmZWU5Y2IwY2Rh"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">But Skarn’s tentacle was relentless. With a wet squelch, the tentacle forced past her defenses, worming its way into her mouth. It tasted of petrichor and decay. Her throat convulsed, gagging on the intrusion.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYzg4OTU5YjhmNzQzNWU5MDk0Y2E5OTg0MDNhNTcw"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Skarn taunted her as she struggled against him. His voice echoed around them. "Lorna, Sigrún. Whatever name you call yourself," he growled. "Your role in the upcoming crusade remains unchanged."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMGI2ODRhYWQ0MTQ1MWRiOThmNzliZDA2NjZlZTcw"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna's response was a soundless snarl. Her fingers clawed at the air, seeking Baldr, yearning for her sword's grip. But it was beyond reach.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMzU2ZjVlOWJmYTRhZTM4MzIyOTgxY2YzZTA5Yjk2"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Valorans. Imperials. Maridians. Those outsider’s lineages are worth little to me," Skarn purred, his words dripping with malice. Each syllable felt like a knife twisting in Lorna's heart. "But you, a Nordling with such fierceness...and functioning reproductive organs…"</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMWQ2NGFiNjRlNTQ5MWZhNmNhZTY5NjVmNmVmNjk4"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Despite the violation coursing through her body, Lorna continued to fight with every ounce of strength she had. Her legs kicked out in a futile attempt to break free from his grip. Minutes felt like hours as Skarn's eyes closed in ecstasy, his tentacle still thrusting into her mouth as he uttered low grunts of pleasure.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOGJlZTkwZjk2YzRiNzQ5YjY5NzhiYWUxNGQ2MGVl"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">And when the thrusting finally stopped, a sickening stream of warm liquid filled her mouth, its pungent scent reminding her of bleach and vinegar. Struggling for air, Lorna ingested, barely able to gag as the liquid slid down her throat. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxM2ZiMWY0NWQ1ZjQzYWY5ZDc4YjA1ZTRhMzQ4MGZk"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Become my Hundkynda and bear my progeny, Sigrún. I could make you birth thousands of creatures to conquer the planets and moons in all Five Realms," Skarn's red eyes fluttered open, alight with perverse delight. His tentacle, repulsively warm, withdrew from her mouth and caressed her cheek with lecherously. "Then, in a new form and protected by the Fenris Horde, our near-extinct people shall rise again!"</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MTFhNWI0NGVmMjRmMmQ4M2MzZmQzYTYwZDRlMzQ4"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Revulsion coursed through Lorna's veins as she coughed, tears tracing down her ivory cheeks. The thought of Skarn’s perversion fueled her defiance, even as she remained ensnared.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOGY1NDFiNWE1MjRlY2JhMWZiMjYwZDM3OWQ3ODI0"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Any words before we return to my Hvel for your impregnations?" Skarn added with arrogant nonchalance.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MjBkNDQzNGIzNDQ0M2ZiYjgxMDRmODJkM2E2NGJk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><span style="font-weight: 400">Lorna's stormy blue eyes locked onto Skarn's, full of determination. With the remnants of his juice still dripping from her mouth, she spat out the words. "</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Baldr, hör meinen Ruf!"</span></em></span></p>
<p class="cnMzNmJmMWRiZjBhYTQzMzlhMjU2OTAzOTA1YzNkM2Q3"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">The air around her hummed, and the Psytum Sword, lying discarded on the ground, answered. Igniting itself, Baldr soared like a vengeful comet toward its mistress.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZWVjY2Y1ZGNkODQ1MTA4YmVlMmIzMjNhYjQ0Yzlk"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">On its way up, the blade severed the tentacles that held her captive. Skarn screamed as Lorna broke free.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYzQzMTk1ODVjNzRkZjM4MjIwNDY3YTJmNGI1ZmVm"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">She crashed to the ground, gasping for breath, her trench coat billowing around her like the wings of an angel in descent. But even as she steadied herself, the taste of Skarn’s essence remained sharp on her tongue.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTI0OWIyODkzYTRmOWM4NWIwMjcyZmI5NzEyY2Rh"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">As Skarn's agonizing roar echoed, Lorna reached for her Medi-Vap inhaler. Her skin was still slick with the residue of his assault as she pressed it to her lips and inhaled deeply.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmY2I0ZmE4ODc1ZjQxMmFiYzJhNWE2NGM1MDA3NTMz"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">The device hissed, releasing a mist of healing agents into her bloodstream. She convulsed, her body wracked with spasms as she vomited up the foul white substance onto the charred floor.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZGNmODRhNDdhZDRmODFhMDliNjNhYWIzOTQ0MTAw"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Bending over Skarn's severed tentacle, Lorna gasped for air, then let out a heavy breath as she expelled more of his cum onto the ground. The fluids mixed with undigested rice and seaweed from the onigiri she had eaten earlier, forming a thick coating on the tentacle.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NDJkYTRkMDMxYzRmZTc4OTZhYTBiNDk1YTM1NGM5"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"I swallowed…" Lorna panted between shudders, turning to look at Skarn who thrashed in torment. For women like her, there was one fate worse than death when dealing with Radi-Mons.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YWZmMDU1NTk1NzRjNTA5YTJlYjI4NmZjYmRmNTMy"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">With panic filling her mind, she muttered. "This must be a dream. It has to be…"</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZDY0NzU1YjBiZjQ1Yzk4NWZjMTAwY2U4ZGEyNDVm"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">But battlefield instincts took over. Whatever awaited her, she needed to leave the scene and stay alive.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMWZmOTVjOGZkNTRkNjY5M2M3ZDRkNGMxNmJkYWFm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><span style="font-weight: 400">She retrieved her Psytum Sword, Baldr, and deactivated it before slipping it into her pocket. Then, she chanted, closing her eyes. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">"Passus Transitus."</span></em></span></p>
<p class="cnNhYTE0ZjllNTYxODQ2NzY5NjBhZGQ5ZTNlN2VlMWE0"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">The world around her fragmented, reality splintering as she teleported away, now over a kilometer away from Skarn.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MDAxZjBkZTdhOTQ2M2RhZTYxZDM4MzM3ZTMzMWQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Diego…" Lorna spoke to the voice comm as she placed a hand on the Psi Shield Device resting on her left ear, voice strained. "I fucked up. Need a way out...now."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NGZhMzBkMmYzNDRjMGZiMTFkNDRmYTM3ODc4MWRi"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Diego's steady voice cut through the static. "You're already forgiven, amiga. But my StarWhale can't land in that hot zone. I'll pin your location and contact Xin."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOTJmODk2MmNmZjRkNTFhZmQ2YWIyZThhZjRmOThh"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yeah, okay," she replied, her breath catching as she ran further away from Skarn. "Can you contact Doctor Nikki?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MzQxMzc5ZGQ0NDRhYWRiNTk4ODFkOTRjYmVlOTky"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Is there an injury your Medi-Vap couldn’t handle?" Diego asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZjVhYWZmOGIzNjQ1NDI4M2RhMGFkNDA2NjE1NTU0"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"I...Skarn...he..." Lorna struggled to explain, still reeling from the shock and trauma.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMGM1ZGNhYmQ5MzRiZmFhYzIwZTgwZDY5MTc1ZGI0"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"It's okay, Lorna. I won't tell anyone," Diego reassured her.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNDdlZTgwMDczMjRhNzNiNDAyYjcyNWZjM2QxZTk2"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Skarn did to me — what he does to women," Lorna's voice steadied as she walked, letting out a heavy sigh. "But he did it through my mouth. I don’t know what that means."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZGRlMWVlNmQzZjRjMThiNDI5OWI1YzJlZjc5NDQ0"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"I'll contact Nikki immediately! Stay safe, Lorna," Diego urged, his professional demeanor tinged with concern.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZTI3YzRkN2U3NzQwMzM4NDNjMjliMjZkNmU2OTgy"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Thank you. I'll try," she muttered, wiping a lingering strand of Skarn's semen from her chin and leaving behind the reminder of her resistance on the scorched ground.</span></p>
