  Zeltros, 43 BBY.
 </p>
 <hr/>
 <p>
  A lot can change in six years. For me, most of that change came in the form of knowledge and perspective.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Once I got a handle on the language, and got my hands on a network connected tablet as part of my education (they called them data pads here), I was able to start gathering information and both verify and expand upon things I’d heard in conversation. One of the first things I’d heard and wanted to check on was what and more importantly
  <em>
   where
  </em>
  my people were.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  The ‘where’ turned out to be a planet named Zeltros and the ‘what,’
  <em>
   Zeltron
  </em>
  <span>
   .
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   No one, not even the local internet
  </span>
  <span>
   equivalent, had heard of ‘Earth’ as a planet. Further searches turned up that we weren’t even in the Milky Way!
  </span>
  <span>
   The galaxy we were in was spiral shaped, like the Milky Way, but I couldn’t even say for sure if we weren’t just in the same galaxy by a different name or far, far away from the place I had called home for two lives. My guess was on the second one though. I had a feeling that w
  </span>
  <span>
   hen Being X had said he would cast me out, he wasn’t kidding.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Zeltros was just one of many,
  <em>
   many
  </em>
  <span>
   inhabited worlds in this galaxy, connected to the others by a galaxy spanning network of hyperspace lanes allowing for interstellar faster than light travel. It was located in the Inner Rim of the galaxy, between the area defined as the Core Colonies where all of the most populous and wealthiest planets were, and the Expansion Region, which
  </span>
  <span>
   was
  </span>
  <span>
   the start of the frontier—the galactic equivalent of the Wild West.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Despite being outside of the core, the planet was ludicrously wealthy and primarily made its money off of tourism, with a dash of trade. Zeltros was a temperate garden world, much like Earth, save that it was cleaner. It was effectively a resort planet and our primary product was…
  </span>
  <em>
   ourselves
  </em>
  <span>
   .
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  That is how I learned the truth of what we were, as a people—and the reason why certain things were the way they were.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Zeltrons, I learned, were a species derived from humanity. Close enough to interbreed, genetically divergent enough to count as a new genus. We were just one of many, included among the likes of Sephi, Borneck, Etti, Chiss, Hapans, Tof, and more. Physically, Zeltrons had skin tones in shades of red—from light pink up through crimson. Hair colors were generally reds, but also blue, black, brown, silver, and white.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  A few things made us stand out from the rest of the ‘near human’ crowd, however—and were the reason Zeltros was a resort planet.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Firstly, Zeltrons were all beautiful. Given that and the unnatural hair coloring, I was betting on there having been some genetic engineering at some point in our past. There was no such thing as an ugly Zeltron, unless they were physically scarred. Every woman I had seen outside of the orphanage was mouth wateringly enticing to my tastes and I imagined puberty was going to be hell for me and a test of my willpower and self-restraint like none before. Even the men were anywhere between handsome and pretty on the masculinity scale, with even the most rugged of them still looking like he had stepped off the set of a Hollywood movie on his
  <em>
   worst
  </em>
  <span>
   day.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Secondly, as I had discovered for myself, we were all mildly telepathic—
  <em>
   empathic
  </em>
  <span>
   , specifically.
  </span>
  <span>
   We were a
  </span>
  <span>
   n
  </span>
  <em>
   entire race
  </em>
  <span>
   of people who could sense and project emotions.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Growing up here reminded me of my first life in Japan, in a way. The walls were paper thin and you could hear everything going on in the neighbors’ homes, so privacy was an illusion you were allowed until you started making too much noise. Or, on the flip side, if you were
  </span>
  <em>
   too quiet
  </em>
  <span>
   people might start thinking there was something wrong with you. In this case, the walls were the ones around your mind, and all of your neighbors were nosy and liked to pry, and if your walls were too thick that was
  </span>
  <em>
   also a problem
  </em>
  <span>
   .
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Not finally, but the last most notable difference, was that we naturally produced pheromones, making us more attractive and likable. Even the children produced them! Though, at least with children, the effect was less sexual and more seemed to trigger paternal instincts.
  </span>
  <span>
   When puberty hit, that’s when we gained conscious control over their production and they changed to a more sexual nature.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   I
  </span>
  <span>
   magine my surprise when I learned that the reason my new home was the vacation destination du jour was because its people were the ‘life of the party.’ We were
  </span>
  <em>
   biological social lubricant!
  </em>
  <span>
   The pheromones were basically applying beer goggles to everyone exposed to them—either by inhalation, skin contact, or contact with our
  </span>
  <em>
   bodily fluids
  </em>
  <span>
   .
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As a former Japanese salaryman, I had been party to more than my fair share of mandatory social drinking with my coworkers and superiors and I knew the effect even a mild impairment would have on someone. Combine that with the fact that we’re naturally sexually attractive and who would say ‘no?’ It was, as some might say, a recipe for a good time.
  </span>
  The empathy on top of it just seemed like overkill, when every Zeltron within range could tell if someone was enjoying themselves or not, and actively nudge them into doing so by projecting their own happy thoughts towards whoever wasn’t feeling it.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  To put it simply… I was reborn into this world on the
  <em>
   Planet of the Hippies
  </em>
  <span>
   . The
  </span>
  <em>
   Planet of like, Free Love, man
  </em>
  <span>
   . Not as a normal human being—
  </span>
  <em>
   oh, no!
  </em>
  <span>
   No, I was reincarnated as a
  </span>
  <em>
   universal sexual party favor
  </em>
  <span>
  </span>
  <span>
   according to the rest of the galaxy!
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Throwing a party? Having an orgy? Trying to curry favor with your local politician of choice? Don’t forget to bring a Zeltron! The more the merrier!
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   I didn’t even have the benefit of being able to say that it was a planet-wide prostitution paradise for anyone with a galactic passport, or the credits and a ship to get here. No, you see,
  </span>
  <em>
   prostitutes get paid
  </em>
  <span>
   and my people…
  </span>
  <em>
   they did it for free!
  </em>
  <span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   At least, on a personal basis,
  </span>
  <span>
   the vast majority didn’t charge for sex
  </span>
  <span>
   .
  </span>
  <span>
   There were exceptions, of course—but those were
  </span>
  <em>
   escorts
  </em>
  <span>
   , not
  </span>
  <em>
   prostitutes
  </em>
  <span>
   .
  </span>
  <em>
  </em>
  <span>
   I guess you could say that technically, the government pimped us out and they were the ones getting paid, then turned around and oh so benevolently paid everyone a percentage of the profits as a monthly stipend,
  </span>
  <span>
   a sort of universal basic income.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   On the one hand, it
  </span>
  <em>
   reeked
  </em>
  <span>
   of communism and offended my financial sensibilities. I hated the idea of someone getting paid for another person’s labor.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  On the other hand, I kind of had to respect the game. Our government knew their product (their people) and they knew we provided services (sex), so why not benefit by charging admission at the door, then just pay everyone a cut of the proceeds?
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   W
  </span>
  <span>
   e didn’t pay taxes, the government paid us
  </span>
  <span>
   from
  </span>
  <span>
   the taxes and revenue they made off of visitors.
  </span>
  <span>
   It wasn’t communism or even socialism, it was technically a wage for an unofficial service the government quietly encouraged its people to participate in, and the majority of those people willingly dove into face first.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  …
  <span>
   Just because we got paid didn’t mean I had to like it.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   B
  </span>
  <span>
   ut even with all of that… The strange, huge new universe full of alien life. The involuntary change in species. The reputation that was sure to follow me around in the future. What upset me the most was that they wouldn’t
  </span>
  <em>
   leave me alone
  </em>
  <span>
   and let me quietly opt out! This bunch of social busybodies were entirely too interested in poking their noses into my business for my own good!
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   They took my unwillingness to participate or interact with certain people and my tendency to shut myself off emotionally as some sort of challenge.
  </span>
  <span>
   They never stopped to think that perhaps
  </span>
  <em>
   they
  </em>
  <span>
   were the problem, not me. No, I was a calm, rational,
  </span>
  <em>
  </em>
  <em>
   logical
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  <span>
   <span>
    human being
   </span>
  </span>
  <span>
   Zeltron who could make her own decisions and chose to abstain voluntarily and thought our planet’s culture was a degenerate cesspool of filth, excess, and debauchery.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  I was the sane one! Everyone else on this planet was crazy.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A
  </span>
  <span>
   lcoholism? Never heard of it. We’ve got two livers so we can drink twice as much!
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Substance abuse? Addiction? Damage to internal organs? We had medical technology to counteract all of those negative effects, so you could mainline the latest designer drugs with no detrimental effects.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Sex addition? Inability to pair bond? Trivializing the most intimate thing two (or more) consenting adults can do? Oh, and let’s not forget about the
  </span>
  <em>
   city-wide underground orgies
  </em>
  <span>
   any time enough teenagers hit critical mass and all got together! No, those are just
  </span>
  <em>
   part of our culture
  </em>
  <span>
   or I was
  </span>
  <em>
   blowing things out of proportion
  </em>
  <span>
   or had
  </span>
  <em>
   outdated view
  </em>
  <em>
   s
  </em>
  <em>
   on sexual relations
  </em>
  <span>
   .
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Stable, loving, monogamous marriage and a nuclear family?
  </span>
  <span>
   You would
  </span>
  <span>
   have
  </span>
  <span>
   to
  </span>
  <span>
   be some sort of selfish, possessive, degenerate prude to want to monopolize
  </span>
  <span>
   a
  </span>
  <span>
   person!
  </span>
  <span>
   <br/>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  No, I was the weird one. I was the outcast for always being a downer, or a wet blanket—a mood killer.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Literally from the day after my birth, in fact. The one time I actually couldn’t keep a lid on things, it had convinced my mother to dump me off at an orphanage. I had actually tracked her down and asked why. It wasn’t hard. Everyone was registered in the system and public transit was free and readily available. It turns out that when a child feels the sort of loss of a battle hardened soldier finally breaking down after seeing their comrades killed and everything they fought for destroyed, it kind of…
  </span>
  <em>
   terrifies
  </em>
  <span>
   normal people. After all, what would a newborn have to complain about?
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   T
  </span>
  <span>
   his planet sucked and I wanted off of it. Thankfully, that option was available to me, once I got a little older.
  </span>
  <span>
   Ten more years and I could sign on with a freighter crew or something and work to pay for passage pretty much anywhere I wanted to go.
  </span>
  <span>
   I was already looking into options, actually.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Apparently, the more civilized parts of the galaxy—the core, that is—were run by a galactic republic, the aptly and
  </span>
  <em>
   creatively
  </em>
  <span>
   named Grand Republic, or just the Republic for short. They were the ones who set the calender and clocks, who controlled the banks and set the value of the galactic standard credit. And despite my…
  </span>
  <em>
   misgivings
  </em>
  <span>
   about the way they seemed to be heading down the slope of mismanagement,
  </span>
  <span>
   corruption, vice, graft, and all of the other signs of a dying empire circling the drain, they were still the best option out there.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  One lifetime with a desk job career in Human Resources and a second with years in the military and practical experience managing people, materiel, and more (in addition to my combat experience) had convinced me that the perfect fusion of those two roles would likely lie in the Republic Navy. If I had been allowed to join the Imperial Navy during my last life instead of being fast tracked through the aerial mage course due to my magic potential, I could have had that comfy life in the rear I had been dreaming of since waking up in the German Empire.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, I wouldn’t be making the mistake of signing up to be what was essentially a cross between a foot soldier and a fighter pilot. No, Plan A was to join the Republic Navy and work my way up the chain of command. If I could get my own command and go do long, boring, routine patrols well out away from any hint of potential combat, sitting back on my ship with my feet up and collecting a pay check, I’d consider that a win. A successful career.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Now if only there wasn’t so much chatter on the galactic internet about rising taxes,
  </span>
  <span>
   tariffs,
  </span>
  <span>
   and the Trade Federation.
  </span>
  <span>
   I didn’t like what I was seeing, and if I was adding everything up correctly, there was only one possible outcome—
  </span>
 </p>
 <hr/>
 <p>
  “
  <span>
   You’re scowling again.
  </span>
  <span>
   What is it this time? The economy? The state of
  </span>
  <span>
   society?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   I looked up from the data pad as the Matron entered my bedroom. In an orphanage, space was at a premium. Normally, I wouldn’t be allowed such a luxury
  </span>
  <span>
   and would instead be crammed into a room with at least three other kids, all in bunk beds. There was just the minor problem that I disliked having roommates intensely, and since we were a species of empaths, my options were limited to either keeping my mental walls up all the time, or letting them know how I really felt.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Keeping myself shielded against casual observation was
  </span>
  <em>
   extremely unnerving
  </em>
  <span>
   to be in the same room with, apparently. I was effectively cutting myself off from one of our primary senses that way. Imagine being in a room with someone and you can’t hear a thing they do, only to look over and suddenly realize they’re there. That was a complaint my former roommates had given repeatedly, until I eventually capitulated and went with the second option.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   That proved to be a mistake, as it turned out. This world and its people are…
  </span>
  <em>
   soft
  </em>
  <span>
   .
  </span>
  <span>
   Not
  </span>
  <em>
   weak
  </em>
  <span>
   , per se, but very
  </span>
  <em>
   sensitive
  </em>
  <span>
   , emotionally speaking. Which,
  </span>
  <em>
   one would think
  </em>
  <span>
   , would be the exact opposite case! If you’re able to listen in to and experience others’ emotions, then surely you would build up
  </span>
  <em>
   more
  </em>
  <span>
   of a resistance to negative emotions and feeling bad. That was not the case at all for most of these people, especially not the children.

   hat softness was so present within the children of the orphanage that there weren’t even any bullies. No little boys pushing others around or hitting them. No little girls practicing their manipulation, lying, and other games. No one causing problems. It was a bit creepy actually, to see children so well behaved, because their emotional maturity skyrocketed from an early age due to being able to feel what others felt—at least, in some ways. They were less prone to be offensive, but again,
  </span>
  <em>
   soft
  </em>
  <span>
   because of it.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Letting down my mental defenses when I came into my bedroom to find my roommates, or when they came in, was sort of like shouting at them that I was bothered by their presence, disliked them, and wanted them to go away. Constantly. It never stopped unless they went away. Now, imagine someone doing that when you’re trying to sleep. If you snore a little too loudly, only to be woken up by shouting. It’s untenable. And the worst part was, I couldn’t exactly help it when I myself was asleep or close to it.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   S
  </span>
  <span>
   ometimes, I wondered if that made
  </span>
  <em>
   me
  </em>
  <span>
   the orphanage bully. But it wasn’t as though I was going out of my way or intentionally trying to hurt them, so I quickly dismissed that notion.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   S
  </span>
  <span>
   o, because I was apparently a literal pain to be around, I was given a room to myself. With a bedroom of my own and a datapad to keep myself entertained, outside of leaving my room to ‘play’ (read: keep myself fit and healthy while building strength, flexibility, and reflexes using the orphanage’s playground equipment), eat, or shower, I generally kept to myself and happily kept myself occupied learning. And a happy Tanya is a Tanya who blends in socially and doesn’t stand out in the background emotional clutter. Everyone benefited from this arrangement, compared to any of the alternatives.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Of course, not everything is all light reading and there are some things a person is just not happy to learn. Learning through the galactic news of financial and political instability affecting shipping, trade, tariffs, taxes, and thus the economies of multiple worlds and my future as a potential Republic Navy recruit if the navy couldn’t afford to pay me, let alone outfit and fuel their ships was not
  </span>
  <em>
   good news
  </em>
  <span>
   or
  </span>
  <em>
   light reading
  </em>
  <span>
   .
  </span>
  <span>
   There was also the risk of joining when it seemed a war was almost inevitable, looming some time in the not so distant future.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   I didn’t want to fight in another war. At the same time, I wanted my freedom and a career path that would set me up to retire comfortably. I was already running a risk/reward evaluation and still coming out on the side of reluctantly joining up.
  </span>
  <span>
   But it had me worried.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “
  <span>
   Trade.”
  </span>
  <span>
   When the woman raised an eyebrow, I explained. “
  </span>
  <span>
   There is some political instability between the Core and the Inner Rim—a few skirmishes breaking out here and there.
  </span>
  <span>
   The Trade Federation
  </span>
  <span>
   is complaining about increasing taxes and tariffs,
  </span>
  <span>
   and having to source materials from different places causing changes in prices due to opportunistic price gouging or use alternate routes which create delays and increases fuel costs
  </span>
  <span>
   . These costs will obviously be passed on to the consumer, creating inflation with no rise in pay to compensate.”

  <span>
   he Matron sat on the bed on the empty bunk opposite my own, studying me as she radiated mild amusement, curiosity, and worry. “And why does that have you scowling?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Tapping the data pad, I brought up my latest findings and passed it to her.
  </span>
  <span>
   The older woman looked it over for a few moments before shaking her head. “I don’t understand. What do stock prices have to do with anything?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “
  <span>
   You couldn’t tell just by looking at their names. I had to do some research to find those, after all. They aren’t widely known,
  </span>
  <span>
   because they’re all based in the frontier. Out in the Expansion Region and Mid Rim. These are areas that the Trade Federation has been expanding into aggressively, going back thirty years, with help from their
  </span>
  <em>
   good friends
  </em>
  <span>
   the IGBC—the Banking Clan. Those companies are all on planets that have had
  </span>
  <em>
   scuffles
  </em>
  <span>
   with the Trade Federation in the past—just a few planets on a very long list that covers a multitude of goods used both in daily life and by the Republic’s various military assets. They were blockades, really.
  </span>
  <span>
   And then, for some reason, those blockaded planets
  </span>
  <span>
   later sign
  </span>
  <span>
   ed
  </span>
  <span>
   some exclusive trade deals with the Trade Federation for whatever it
  </span>
  <span>
   wa
  </span>
  <span>
   s they produce, only for the blockade to
  </span>
  <em>
   coincidentally
  </em>
  <span>
   lift. Then, to the surprise of literally no one who understands finance, the prices on whatever goods those planets were exporting went up—sometimes as little at fifty percent, sometimes as high as a one thousand percent increase. The destination for the majority of those goods? The Core and the Inner Rim.
  </span>
  <span>
   We’re seeing the beginnings of hyperinflation in the inner systems. Even
  </span>
  <em>
   we
  </em>
  <span>
   haven’t been unaffected by all of this. I’m sure you’ve noticed that the price of certain staple goods that are imported from the Expansion Region’s agri-worlds,
  </span>
  <span>
   such as flour and sugar,
  </span>
  <span>
   have gone up? Those now have exclusive trade deals with the Trade Federation.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “And these companies?” the Matron wagged the data pad, growing more worried the more I laid it out for her.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   I smiled and for some strange reason,
  </span>
  <span>
  </span>
  <span>
   the Matron flinched. I carefully hid my amusement. I had no idea
  </span>
  <em>
   why
  </em>
  <span>
   , it was the same smile I always used, but for some reason it always drew out a peculiar reaction in others.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>

  <span>
   By which I meant, for a brief moment, the woman was
  </span>
  <em>
   terrified
  </em>
  <span>
   of something before she repressed the emotion. And she wasn’t unique in that reaction. Personally, I thought it was strange. I had a beautiful smile—I’d know, I’d tried it on myself in the mirror more than enough to know what it looked like,
  </span>
  <span>
   in two lifetimes
  </span>
  <span>
   .
  </span>
  <span>
   I
  </span>
  <span>
   f they were going to react like that, it really
  </span>
  <span>
   only made me want to do it more.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   It
  </span>
  <em>
   did
  </em>
  <span>
   make me wonder if that wasn’t what everyone who saw me smiling like that in my previous life felt…
  </span>
  <span>
   It might go a way towards explaining some of the strange things my enemies liked to shout at me when we fought.
  </span>
  <span>
   Epithets like
  </span>
  <em>
   devil
  </em>
  <span>
   or
  </span>
  <em>
   demon

   .

  “
  <span>
   The first? An orbital works. A shipyard that produces large, bulk
  </span>
  <span>
   troop
  </span>
  <span>
   transport and vehicle carriers. The second? A heavy weapons manufacturing plant. They make hover tanks and other such craft. The other three are all droid factories specializing in combat droids. One makes the B1 series of battle droids. Small, light, cheap, fast, and easy to produce. Reviews say their targeting algorithms and AI are crap, but put enough of them together and continuous fire will handle most problems. Another makes the B2, the B1’s bigger, angrier brother. Just as dumb, but much harder to kill. They’re shock troops, essentially. Meant to be sent in to soak up fire while someone maneuvers B1s into a flanking position. The third produces something called a droideka, or destroyer droid. They can curl into a ball and roll themselves where they need to go. Fast, heavily armed, and they have energy shields. They’re basically mobile turrets.”

 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Matron had begun to pale the longer I went on. Finally, she swallowed thickly as
  </span>
  <em>
   fear
  </em>
  <span>
   briefly rolled off of her before she shut it out. “And… the stocks of those all went up?”
   <br/>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  “
  <em>
   Massively
  </em>
  <span>
   .”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Which would mean…”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “
  <span>
   It means that business is booming,” I nodded, confirming what she didn’t want to say. “
  </span>
  <span>
   Someone has made some
  </span>
  <em>
   very large
  </em>
  <span>
   purchases recently.
  </span>
  <span>
   You could make the argument that militaries replace their hardware all the time and this could simply be a case of cycling in new equipment.
  </span>
  <span>
   Normally, I’d agree, if it weren’t for everything else going on around it.
  </span>
  <span>
  </span>
  <span>
   Put it all together and it paints a very grim picture for the future. I estimate ten, maybe twenty years before a war breaks out between the Republic and the Trade Federation—which would really be a war between the Republic and the IGBC, using the Trade Federation as a proxy.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   S
  </span>
  <span>
   ighing, the older woman slumped in a bit on herself. “I see. That is…
  </span>
  <em>
   distressing
  </em>
  <span>
   .” Her red
  </span>
  <span>
   eyes bored into my blue. “I don’t see how it would concern you in particular, though.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was planning to join the Republic Navy when I got old enough to leave.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “
  <span>
   Oh,” the Matron winced. “Yes, I see now.”
  </span>
  <span>
   Sighing, she powered off the datapad and stood, putting on a stern look even as she radiated concern. “I think that’s enough reading for today. Go outside. Go play. Go do something else and stop worrying about all of this. You’re upsetting the other children. You can worry about adult problems when you become an adult.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “
  <span>
   The children of today inherit today’s problems tomorrow, if the adults of today fail to handle them,” I grumbled, but pushed myself off the bed and gathered up my jacket. We were fully into fall and while the climate in the Northern Province was generally mild, it was still cool enough to need one.
  </span>
  <span>
   Grabbing my datapad back, I slid it into one of my jacket pockets.
  </span>
  <span>
   I took a moment to pull my silver hair back into a short tail so it wouldn’t hang loose, then made my way outside.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Sparing a glance at the playground, I considered it and the
  </span>
  <span>
   two
  </span>
  <span>
   children there for a moment,
  </span>
  <span>
   also here instead of at school today
  </span>
  <span>
   . As soon as I stepped into view however, the previously happy children all turned wary
  </span>
  <span>
   and unwelcoming. That was fine. I generally stuck to using the equipment when they weren’t around anyway. There was somewhere else I could go instead.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Making my way to the public transit station, I settled in to wait for a train,
  </span>
  <span>
   taking out my tablet and powering it back on so I could check the local news. Humming, I skimmed over the headlines on my way to the finance column.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   If I had some money, I could really play the intergalactic stock market right now and make a killing. With years of advance notice, I might even be rich enough to retire without going into the navy by the time I get old enough to.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A headline briefly caught my eye and I raised an eyebrow. ‘Jedi Master
  </span>
  <span>
   and Council member to meet with officials regarding offer to join the
  </span>
  <span>
   Galactic
  </span>
  <span>
   Republic.’
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   I’d heard of the Jedi before, of course. They came up numerous times during my deep dives into recent local and galactic history—and grew more and more prominent the further back I went. Thousands of years, in fact. They were a semi-monastic, pseudo-religious order of what closely resembled
  </span>
  <em>
   battle monks
  </em>
  <span>
   and lately seemed to serve almost as an extension of the Republic itself. They were peacekeepers, problem solvers, and diplomats. They believed in something called The Force—a sort of universal energy field, around and inside everything and everyone, which seemed to have a will of its own according to their beliefs.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t belief in any one specific deity, but rather, the way I understood it, it was kind of like a concept I was familiar with from my first life, having been born Japanese. When a living being died, their essence returned to the Force. That included the souls of sentient beings. So, in a way, veneration of the Force was a form of ancestor worship, in addition to a belief in a greater driving will.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn’t necessarily agree with it, but I will say that it didn’t make me twitchy and start looking for a rifle. If they wanted to worship some universal energy field, that was fine with me. Especially since I could actively prove it existed any time I felt like it, given that my powers used that same energy and I could draw in more from the world around me or interact with it any time I wanted.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Still, what are the odds this is related to the pattern I’m seeing? I’ll need to look at a map and go through headlines to see if there are other worlds where similar meetings are taking place. If the Core is trying to use the Inner Rim as a shield against the Trade Federation in the Expansion Region and outwards, then I don’t want to be here and should start looking into moving that timetable for leaving up.

   Eventually, the monorail came and I climbed aboard. It was a short, half hour ride to my destination, and when I stepped out onto the platform the difference between now and when I’d gotten on was like night and day. I breathed a sigh of relief as I took in the
  </span>
  <em>
   emotional silence
  </em>
  <span>
   around me,
  </span>
  <span>
   before I started walking.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As it turns out,
  </span>
  <em>
   not everyone
  </em>
  <span>
   on the Party Planet of the Free Love Hippies followed the whole
  </span>
  <em>
   vibe
  </em>
  <span>
   of the place full time. A planet still needed a functioning government and other institutions to run. And given that this was a planet full of
  </span>
  empaths, or rather
  <em>
   humanoid lie detectors
  </em>
  <span>
   , it made sense that those who went into politics would learn how to shield their minds.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Nearly the entire district that served as the seat of power for the Northern Province of Zeltros was a sea of emotional calm. Even the basics such as janitorial services and food service were taken care of droids, so as not to disturb the silence. For most Zeltrons, I imagined it was unnerving. It would be like, for a human on Earth, walking into a crowded mall only for it to be dead silent.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  The reality was, the silence was a tool. You see, in that sea of silence, any emotion at all stood out. Which meant that foreign dignitaries were super easy to spot and read for my people.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  As for myself, as long as I kept generally out of sight, no one complained about my presence. I blended into the background here, with my mental shields up. As long as no one saw me, I might as well be invisi—
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “
  <span>
   Now, that is
  </span>
  <em>
   rather
  </em>
  <span>
   interesting.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   I blinked, my head whipping to the side as I spotted movement coming out of one of the nearby restaurants. For a moment, I mentally kicked myself for falling into the same trap as the locals—relying too much on my empathic sense to feel out those around me and not enough on my eyes and ears. Lt. Col. Tanya von Degurechaff would have
  </span>
  <em>
   had one of her subordinates doing PT until doomsday
  </em>
  <span>
   for that mistake.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   I met eyes with a man coming out, carrying a takeout bag and a drink. The first thing I noticed was that he was human—just a standard, baseline human. He was an older man, white, with a beard and hair that were turning more salt than pepper with age. He was tall, easily two meters and change, and the way he moved and carried himself had the soldier in me sitting up and taking notice, like recognizing like.
  </span>
  <span>
   He wore a brown robe over his clothes, and when he shifted the bag he was carrying I spotted something that looked vaguely like a flashlight stuck to the side of his belt.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He was also a complete damned
  </span>
  <em>
   void
  </em>
  <span>
   to my empathy. Despite his amused smile, not a trace of whatever he was feeling slipped out.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “It’s rare to see a child with that sort of mental control, especially among your people,” he mused. Studying me for a moment, his smile widened fractionally and he nodded. “It’s a pleasant day. Would you mind humoring an old man? Come sit with me. Have you eaten?”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   His words reminded me that I hadn’t had lunch yet, so I shook my head. “I have not.
  </span>
  <span>
   I left before lunch time.
  </span>
  <span>
   Are you sure?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “
  <span>
   I’m certain.”
  </span>
  <span>
   He placed his bag and cup down on one of the tables outside and gestured towards one of the seats. I raised an eyebrow as it scraped along the ground two feet, moving back from the table. “
  </span>
  <span>
   Sit, please. I’ll be right back.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   I watched as he made his way back into the restaurant. Shrugging, I moved over to the table and sat down,
  </span>
  <span>
   waiting patient for him to return. The situation was a bit strange, but I was curious. I might have been worried, but he didn’t seem like the type to offer me candy that he kept in his van just around the corner, and if he did…
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   I
  </span>
  <span>
   reached down and checked the knife in my jacket pocket, making sure it was ready.
  </span>
  I
  <em>
   highly doubted
  </em>
  <span>
   anyone would be prepared to deal with an invisible mage blade
  </span>
  <span>
   that could extend well beyond the distance between myself and the seat across the table,
  </span>
  <span>
  </span>
  <span>
   removing limbs or
  </span>
  <span>
   parting their head from their shoulders,
  </span>
  <span>
   if it came down to a fight.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  The older man returned a moment later and sat. “We won’t have to wait long,” he informed me, before bowing slightly at the waist where he sat. “I am Jedi Master Dooku. And who do I have the pleasure of speaking with, young lady?”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Huh. Wasn’t expecting to actually meet the guy.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “
  <span>
   Tanya. I was just reading about you. I expected you to be in talks with the government for most of the day. This is…
  </span>
  <em>
   quite
  </em>
  <span>
   the coincidence.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The old man chuckled. “We took recess for lunch. As for our meeting, ‘coincidence’ is sometimes just another name for the will of the Force. I’ve found that time and time again, it ha
  </span>
  <span>
   s
  </span>
  <span>
   guided me to where I need to be and who I need to meet, when I need to meet them. So tell me, young Tanya.
  </span>
  <span>
   Should you not be
  </span>
  <span>
   in school?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  I shrugged. “I home school myself. I’m not allowed to attend a normal public school.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “
  <span>
   If you’ll humor me, what brings you here today?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Letting out a chuckle of my own, I smiled. To my surprise, the old man didn’t flinch, and I still didn’t sense a thing off of him. “I got kicked out and told to go play, or do literally anything other than continue reading. Apparently,
  </span>
  <span>
   I
  </span>
  <span>
   was bothering the other children.
  </span>
  <span>
   The Matron complained that I was worrying too much.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “
  <span>
   Oh?
  </span>
  <span>
   ”
  </span>
  <span>
   he asked, curiosity in his tone. “Not to diminish your worries, but surely a child has little to worry about beyond the typical worries of children.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Shaking my head, I pulled out my tablet and brought up what I had shown the Matron. “Have a look and tell me what you think.”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Jedi Dooku read over the list of companies and stock increases and his genial smile slowly fell. Slowly, he looked up and met my eyes across the table. “Why don’t you tell me what you believe this means?”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Shrugging, I launched into the explanation I had given the matron. Dooku began nodding along as I spoke, clearly familiar with everything I was saying. Finally, he pushed the tablet back to me as another order of food and a drink came out. He opened the food up and presented me with the new batch—spicy noodles, vegetables, and a meat not unlike chicken.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  “You say you’re interested in joining the Republic Navy?” he asked, and I nodded. Humming, the old man studied me for a moment longer before asking, “Have you considered a career in politics instead?”
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Leaning closer, I asked, “What did you have in mind?”
