<p class="cnM3NTk3OTZiYTZmMTQ1OTViMDUyMWEyZTEzMjFlM2Q1" style="text-align: center"><strong><span style="font-size: 1.1em">A World Several Solar Systems away from Silverfall</span><br/>Within the Grand Silvanian Empire</strong></p>
<p class="cnM4NzI2MmQ0Nzk4OTRhM2Y5ZmM5NGUzMDIyMTkwMmNk">Emperor Leopold paces back and forth across the only landing station on the world of Sclara, proving himself unable to get the words of the princess out of his mind. Her actions. And, most importantly, what she looked like after learning that her family was really alive.</p>
<p class="cnM2ODg3ZjRlOTAyZTRlYjVhMDdmNjljMjRhNjIyZDhm">And that her family is most likely different from the one she remembers.</p>
<p class="cnNkYzZlMTBmYjNjMTQyNzc5MDcwMjcxZmJlZTg0MDU3">He went to this secluded military outpost world due to how few people are here and the distance it is away from Silverfall, trying to make absolutely certain that the curse won’t flare up here. Since the curse would flare up even from so much as being in earshot of a phone call that the princess was within earshot of. Much less being on a planet somewhere nearby her.</p>
<p class="cnM2MjM1Y2MzYzYzYTQyMDE5NGM1OWZiMTc4Y2I3MzA5">But for the first time since contacting them, he has very little room in his mind for the curse.</p>
<p class="cnMwNzVlODU4ZjgxNjRkNjNhNGM2YjIwNWZiMjZiZDIw"><em>How are they going to take this? Will they be upset? No, there’s no doubt they’ll be upset. They’ve been waiting for nearly a century to see their baby girl. I’d be upset if it were me as well… but they should also have been expecting this, right?</em></p>
<p class="cnNmNWJlNjM4NDEwYzRkYTE5ZGY3NjRjZTA4MTQ5NjMz">Leopold continues pacing back and forth across the massive, round landing pad.</p>
<p class="cnNjZDJkMWFjODJjODQ4NjJhYzNjYjllZTM4MDZmZGQ2">All of the knights of the empire have already been sent away on missions, leaving the entire planet barren despite its position as a military outpost. Because there is no way Leopold or the Crimson Empire can let word of this meeting reach the ears of any of the Horsemen.</p>
<p class="cnM0OWQwZjFmZTMxYjQ0ODk5NThlN2FmYjUyYTU3NjY2">He continues to pace back and forth for nearly half an hour before the space above the world flash a deep crimson and reality itself shatters, allowing a vast spaceship half the size of the planet itself to come out from the depths of the shattered reality. From the wormhole created by the spaceship.</p>
<p class="cnMwMWRhYWFmNzAwNjQ4NTZiNTI1ZTM3MWJhMDlkNjM5">The ship itself is coated in black and crimson energy jumping from one plate of its armor to another like electricity. Meanwhile hundreds of ships of much smaller and normal sizes appear alongside the enormous flagship in the form of battleships.</p>
<p class="cnNlZjg5ZTMxNTNiNjQ3ZGNhZWQ3OWU4MjM4ODRiMjlm">Once again proving that the Crimson Empire’s military is overprotective of their royalty.</p>
<p class="cnM4YTM5Y2YyZWMyYzQzOTc5ZmQ0NzhhYmM5OTllMGI1">Leopold understands the empire’s protectiveness to a degree, since their royal family is on the blacklist of the three most powerful beings in the universe. But the royal family are also some of the most powerful beings in the universe themselves, even if they’re not on the level of the Horsemen. So he does still believe that an entire fleet as bodyguards is a bit much.</p>
<p class="cnNlNzEwMmFiOTAyYjQxNmViMDRiYjUxYmYwOTY1OWFi">The entire fleet surrounds the planet as Leopold’s closest friend appears outside of the ship in a flash of black and red energy. The woman is wearing a black and crimson set of high tech armor far more advanced than any other nation. Even the Rex Dynasty of the Dead.</p>
<p class="cnMyN2YwMDFhNDllYTQ2NjJhMzUyOTg3OTgwMTExZjI4">However, this armor was no doubt made through both magic and technology, leaving the Rex Dynasty of the Dead still in the lead with pure technology.</p>
<p class="cnM1MTY1YWFhNjBiNjQzMmRiNDc4OWM2MzkwNWRmZmZh">Just the sight of his best friend brings a warm smile to Leopold’s face. She’s still just as beautiful as the last time he saw her, with her form-fitting armor matching her curves, her stark white hair floating amongst the crimson and black energy around her as she floats down into the atmosphere of the sand and water-covered planet. And her glowing crimson eyes reminding him strongly of her daughter. Except with a hint of kindness and an edge to her gaze that her daughter’s increasingly apathetic by the day gaze is missing.</p><span class="cmNiYmQ2MzJkMThjNzRmOWI4OGIxYTRkMmUwOGRmZjdj"><br/>Unauthorized reproduction: this story has been taken without approval. Report sightings.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM1NTk5ZWViMzQzMjQxZmZhY2NlNDk1NDkxMzg2YjAx">But it’s not just her eyes that look just like Aria. Everything about her appearance is just like the Princess of the Crimson Empire. Her figure, her hair, her face, eyes, everything. Just with a mildly older appearance and more edge to her. Without any of Aria’s apathy.</p>
<p class="cnNmY2EzYzU0M2ZiZTQ4MDA4N2U4NTE2NDlhMWNlMGM4">Even with those small differences in attitude, she is very clearly Aria Crimson’s mother.</p>
<p class="cnNhZGFlNzUzNmIwNzQ3OWM5ZjRlMmJkY2Y5ZTA1YzQ3">Lucilia Crimson isn’t the only person to leave the ships, however, as her husband and son do as well. And both of them look related to Aria as well, even if not to the degree of her mother.</p>
<p class="cnNiY2Y0OWFmYTVmNTQ1MzM4OGUwNDI5NjYzMGE3Yjhk">Meanwhile hundreds of soldiers, all wearing crimson robes with their hoods pulled down and a mask over their face, leave the ships alongside them. Forming a massive circle as the group floats down to the planet’s surface to meet Leopold on the landing pad.</p>
<p class="cnMxMjlkN2YxNzMwOTQyMTZiZTQ1YzI0YjIzYjg2YmVl">Lucilia, the Empress of the Crimson Empire, smiles while looking at Leopold before saying, “It’s been a while since we met in person, Leo.”</p>
<p class="cnMzYTgwMmZmMWY5YTQ4ZTRhOTM5ZGQ3ODg2NGJkYzE3">“That it has, Luci,” Leopold responds with a smile of his own. Then he turns to look at the emperor with a nod.</p>
<p class="cnM1MDk3MTc2MDE2NTQ5M2NhYjE4Y2YxODIzMjM5M2Jh">Artorius Crimson, the Emperor of the Crimson Empire, nods back with his brows furrowed while crossing his arms as he asks, “So you told her? How did she take it?”</p>
<p class="cnMwM2YzZGM3YzE0YTRiODc4MWQyY2NjNDg1NDExNjZj">Leopold grimaces at that before answering, “Not very well.”</p>
<p class="cnM4NGQ2ZGRmNGE0ZDQ0NDJhNDliOTk4MzdhY2M2MGVi">All three of the people in front of him, each of whom are some of the most powerful beings in the universe second only to the Horsemen of the Apocalypse, flinch. In fact, in some ways, the Empress even surpasses a single Horseman of the Apocalypse. Yet, despite that power, Leopold soon watches them grow increasingly anxious.</p>
<p class="cnMzNGVmM2ZlOWM2ODQyZTU5NjFmNTc0ZmI4NmMxY2M2">The empress starts her usual habit – one Leopold remembers from all those years ago – where her fingers twitch to show her anxiety. Meanwhile the emperor repeatedly crosses and uncrosses his arms, likely without even realizing he’s doing it.</p>
<p class="cnMzZmVlOWMyMzg5YTRhYjI4YzY1ZDljOGY4YTFjM2I5">But their son is the worst of the three, the man beginning to pace back and forth while muttering about his baby sister hating him.</p>
<p class="cnNlZjJhMWJlYzgzNTQ1MDViZjc5MTRjMDczN2ZhNDBh">And it’s at this point that Leopold grimaces, remembering one major issue this family has other than the issue of their clones.</p>
<p class="cnM0ODgyOGIyODUwOTRmMjdiMTg3YmE1NTc5YjIwMGU5">Leopold reaches into his pocket and pulls out a red crystal. The red crystal he asked for from Aria a few days ago, nearly one week after he originally told her about her family.</p>
<p class="cnMxZDRmZWJmYWQ4ZDRmMzRiNzA3Y2RjM2UzYmY5ZTJl">All three of the crimsons in front of him immediately lock their eyes on the crystal before Luci rushes forwards and grabs it from Leopold’s hands. Then she closes her eyes and begins to manipulate the crimson and black energy within the amulet. Using her ability to directly manipulate and control life force to unlock the memories within.</p>
<p class="cnM5MjY2MDcyZWQxODRhODJhY2M3NjFkMGZmMWJkZjMy">And in just a few seconds, a crimson energy leaves the crystal in three different paths. One leading to Luci’s forehead, another to Artorius’s forehead, and the last to Adrian’s forehead.</p>
<p class="cnMxYWU1ZjNmZDcxZjQ1ZTliOTg0Mjg3YmM0ZmU1MWM1">Leopold then takes a step back, briefly glancing at the guards surrounding them without saying a word. A sight he still finds creepy to this day thanks to their masks.</p>
<p class="cnNiN2YyNmZlOGQ0MTQwYmY5ODJhYTM5NWRjNjU5NmRh">But none of the guards say a word.</p>
<p class="cnNmNTE0ODcxZDBjMzQyNDE5YjU5M2Y0OTgzOTNkMDgy"><em>Even now they’re being incredibly overprotective. Despite how long I’ve been working with them… it’s a wonder Aria is ever able to make it within several feet out of her own guards’ sight.</em></p>
<p class="cnM0YjUxZDhlOThlZTQ2YmRiZTAyMjNkOWIyMTU3YTQ4">He turns his gaze back to the three imperials to find them all with tears beginning to form from their glowing red eyes. No doubt watching the memories of their clones flash by through their minds.</p>
<p class="cnMyYjMzYjNiOGZiNjQwMDFhYTVmOWExOWViNzQzNWY5">Leopold gives a sad smile, already having expected this due to knowing a vague amount about what happened to Aria on Vortel.</p>
<p class="cnM3ODUzOWM3OWRkMjRkNjc5ZmE2OTM4NzhjYWRiNTFl">He also knows that if it weren’t for the curse, she probably wouldn’t be able to step out of the Crimson Empire’s flagship for eons after they find out what she’s been through. Assuming she let them keep her there, which is unlikely.</p>
<p class="cnM0NzRkNTY2YWVjYjRhMjk4ODMxNzhmMTA4MGU2N2Yx"><em>But…</em></p>
<p class="cnNjMmFjZjcwMjlmODRjZTA5ZjY4NTE5M2U3NWFlYThl">His sad smile turns even sadder as the three drop to their knees, each muttering different things.</p>
<p class="cnNjZTQwZjdmZTQ2YjRjNWU4MmVmNWNmMzQxNjllY2Zl">“My baby…” “My little rabbit…” “Little Aria…”</p>
<p class="cnMxOTNkNTA4M2YxZTQ1YWE4MmMwMTM0ZGVmZGRhMzJj"><em>…they really do still think of her as a baby, don’t they?</em></p>
<p class="cnNlOTI0ZGFkODQxNTQ0M2E5NTNiYzcyZDBhZmJiMDRk">Leopold understands their thinking a little bit, since the only time they’ve ever seen her and held her in their arms was when she was a newborn infant. And their family has lived for over a million years by now, so even a century isn’t very long for them. Or Leopold, for that matter.</p>
<p class="cnNiOTM0Mzc3ZTlhZTRhYzc5MzUxMmQxYWNmYTM5NmRm">But they have barely even been able to see her since, and only through images and recordings.</p>
<p class="cnNmN2ViYWU0YzY5MzRjODA5ODUzNmEyMDkzNGEzMzY4">The Emperor of the Grand Silvanian Empire isn’t sure how to handle this situation. Since he feels like they really will treat her like a baby when they see her at this rate. Even if only in their minds.</p>
<p class="cnM5OGMyNWFmNDAyNTQ4MDU5YjYyNzk5ODkwM2UxZGZi">And the Aria Leopold has come to know will <em>not </em>be pleased by that.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZDQwMzdlZGY2ZDQyODQ5Y2FkNWJjYTVkZjYyOWE3">Leopold lets out a pent up breath as he watches the three break down, ignoring the stares he knows are being drilled into him from all of the guards nearby.</p>
<p class="cnMzOTgwOGRhOWVlNTQ5NWZiMjcxZmJkYTIzODEyN2Ex"><em>I’ll have to do my best to change their way of thinking. To convince them she’s an adult. And to make sure they don’t come off too strongly. For Little Aria’s sake…</em></p>
