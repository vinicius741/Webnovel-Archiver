<p class="cnNiMjg5MDI5YWYzMDRiOWQ4ZTY1MTFhOWM5Y2NkNGQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">I was brought back to consciousness in a snap. My body was a sweaty mess despite the cold atmosphere. Although I was extremely uncomfortable, I could not move an inch. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlMGZjY2FjYzdlMTRiMmM4MWQ4NWZhNjYxMmM2N2Uy"><span style="font-weight: 400">The vestiges of a nightmare still lingered on my mind. It was a bizarre, irrational fever dream, yet one which felt tangibly real.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OTFlMjFiMmNmZTRlNTJhNTAyN2MwNThhZjkzODFh"><span style="font-weight: 400">A world falling apart from its very core. Corruption spreading to all corners, making life impossible. But among the destruction, countless balls of light came down from the sky. They swerved through the air and made the corruption retreat, working to revert the world to normalcy.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhM2VmMzI5OGRiYzRkMGJhNDI1ZTAxMjI0MjA0YmJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">So that no one could find out the truth.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOTkxZTg2ZDAxNDQ0YzFhNzUyNDU1NmQxMTQ0MWQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">So that the lies could keep going forever.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MjZiYjZiMzQ2MDQ3ZDg4ZWI2Y2NlMjcyYTJjMTI5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite being awake, I revisited this nightmare over and over again. Like an earworm, it refused to leave my thoughts. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxYzE0MjQ2YTk3MjRhNDk5ZTQzZmYyYTljYjQ4ZDJj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Was it real? Or was it the product of my crushed mind?</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MzUxZGQ4ZDQ2MzQ5YjQ4MDFjM2ZjMDc3ZjM4ZjFm"><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt disoriented, unable to grasp reality.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOTlhYzAyMmE3NDQ2OWFiN2QwMzhhNDJlY2M2YjVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Trying to dispel the fog surrounding my thoughts, I turned on my bedside lamp. As if it had been a trigger, the nightmare was replaced by the bitter-sweet memories I chose to retain.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YTYwOTUwZjRhZTQ2ZThiZTUzMmQwN2Q4M2Q2OTNm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Everything flooded in at once. Despite knowing I was here because of what we managed to accomplish, the gut-punch of the consequences overwhelmed me.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOTRlNTQ0MmJhNDQ0ZmU5ZjU1NWI2ODdlZDE4Nzhj"><span style="font-weight: 400">She was gone. And this time, she wasn’t coming back.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyY2U0NWVkNWU1YTRlNDc4NWY4ZmRiYmI5OGYzOTlk"><span style="font-weight: 400">What was left of her was an incomplete person. A husk. A puzzle with a missing piece.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZDQyYjlkZjllYjRkNWI5NjM2ZmM2MzVjNTc1NzI5"><span style="font-weight: 400">When I noticed, streaks of tears were running down my face.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYTgyMTBkNmNmZDQzYTg5NWZjYTlhMTgwZmNjZjI1"> </p>
<p class="cnNmNGJjOWRlODAxODQ4NWNiMWI3YjYwYzc2YTQ3MmUx"><span style="font-weight: 400">* * *</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZmVlNGE3OTQ5MzRiMmY4MWRjZDJhZTgxYWFhMWY3"> </p>
<p class="cnNiMzRlNGM1N2ExMDQ1ODJiMjgzNWRlYmEzZDdlMjIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">My sobbing stopped on its own some undetermined time later.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMGZmYWU1YzE4ZjQ5Yjc5ODhiNjQzZTdiZDIxZDRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how much it pained me, I had to move forward. After all, I was the one who decided to take this route. Compared to the alternative, living in a world of lies, unable to ever know the truth, this was a piece of cake.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMDM5MjM0YTQ0ZTQ4NTJhOTllMDlmMTUxNzBjNGQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Moving forward meant not only accepting that Ayumi was gone, but also that I would have to live with the burden of the truth.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNGYwZWRjMzQwYjRmMjhiNGFjNDYwMGI4NTMyODkx"><span style="font-weight: 400">The truth of this world I called my own.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NDdhNGY5NDIwZjRlNzU5MmFlNmQzZjZhNGY1MmUz"><span style="font-weight: 400">But how could I accept such a thing?</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMjYzNTdlODdmZDQ0ZTk4YjMzYzdhMzcxZDA1Njgx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Everything was a fabrication.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMDc3NWE3ZTk2MTRlNDg5MjE2MDY5Y2ZmMDg4NTYy"><span style="font-weight: 400">A lie.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZGUzODRjZDcyYzRkYjg4OWZlN2E1M2NmN2QwOTg2"><span style="font-weight: 400">I wandered around my room aimlessly until I decided to take a peek outside.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDUyNzZmYzE0MzRhNjA5OGJmZTcwMTgzNTY5Yjhh"><span style="font-weight: 400">To my surprise, it was snowing.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYzkzYTU4ZDJhYjRmYjA5NDljMDJkYThkOGEzMTc1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Light flakes fell from the sky in droves, dancing in the air before making their way to the ground. They covered the sleeping city in a white blanket.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ODkzZWFmMGY3YjQwODFhNDhkOGJmNDRmYzg0Njdl"><span style="font-weight: 400">I opened the window and reached out, letting the snow fall on my hand.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZjgwNGZlYmFkMzRjMTQ4ZGVlYThiNjE5Zjg2MDMw"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no forecast of snow for the next few days.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnMyYjBiYzE4NWQyZjQyNDNhOWQ1NDE2MmJkZTBhOWUz"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">That means this really is a backup, isn’t it?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnMwNTA5ZTQ4NDcwNzQwZjFhM2YwNGNiMDg2YmI4NDRl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite all the insane events I had gone through, this realization was the most shocking of all.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNTI4MWVlZDUyMTRiMTI4ZTNiMGViZTY2YzNhOWQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">The cherry on top of this cake of absurdity.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOThkMWYxYTRlMTRhYWFhNzExZjliNzAzZmI4NmI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">I had become a time traveler.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYjcwZjdjNzVjYjRjODM5ZmEyNDE1MDdkZjkzNTcy"><span style="font-weight: 400">The last time it snowed was three weeks before the Illumination. The night before Ayumi and I went on the exploration of that abandoned mansion.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ODFjYzc1NGM3ODQ3ZTZhZjhjZDMwZjE5ZTc4MWNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">With the cold air rushing in from the outside, I began feeling my body heat being drained due to the sweat still clinging to my clothes.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDI5N2Q5ZmFiYTRmYzU4MGIxNDU1M2I1ZjIxZTI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Before I fell ill, I closed the window and left the cold outside.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMDcwY2JlMjU0YzQxN2Q4ZWY1YjU4MGJlMDhjMDhm"><span style="font-weight: 400">That was when I noticed the snow globe sitting on my desk, the one my sister gave me all those years ago.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNWFkZmRhNmZiZjRjNmI4NDMyMTdhZDMzOTY2Njg5"><span style="font-weight: 400">I took it in my hand and gave it a gentle shaking to clear my mind. The fake snow swirled around in the liquid. After I stopped, it settled down, covering the little house and the pine tree, along with the ground, with a thick layer of white. The snowman inside passively watched the snow fall with a content smile etched onto its face.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMGI2YWIyZDkxMTQ4NmJiZTc3NmEwMTcwYmJjYzYx"><span style="font-weight: 400">I gave it another shake.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NGNiM2QyMjA0OTQ5ZGQ4ODk5YWYxZTJhZmMxOGE0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then another.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxODVhNTA2MDdkZTRjMzI4M2MwMzliZGY2NzQ1NDNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">When the snow settled again, I shook it once more.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNjhiZDdjNzhiOTQyODliYWFjN2M3OWU3YmJlZDcw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Each time I did, I wondered how that snowman saw the world from inside the globe. For him, the entire world was this tiny globe. And that world was real, and so was the snow, and the house, and the pine tree, and of course himself.</span></p><span class="cjZlZDllMDViYzhhOTQxZDk5MjY2ZTM5YTNkZGZmNmY3"><br/>If you find this story on Amazon, be aware that it has been stolen. Please report the infringement.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM1YzlmZjY3M2UyMzRlNzZhNjE0YzNhODdjMDgxZjEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">The only event in the world inside the snow globe was the snow falling. The snowman had no idea what caused it. For him, it was just how the world worked. Sometimes, the world shook, the snow swirled around, and then the snow fell. You could say, for the snowman, that was nature itself. Something he could never hope to understand. An act of God.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOWZjZjkxMDI3YTRlMjJiNWE0ODNmMzliZTAzZDg1"><span style="font-weight: 400">But, of course, that was ludicrous. The cause of the snow wasn’t nature, something beyond anyone’s control.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYzRlNzI4OWUxZTQzNmJhMTlhY2NmM2IxOGUyMGY5"><span style="font-weight: 400">I, shaking the snow globe, knew the truth.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YzVmNjcwMjk4ZjQxYjY5ZmJjNTVmNWYxODljZjA4"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was caused by someone.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMzU3YTVlYjU4YjRjMmU5N2QwOGZiMWMxYjRjNTA0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Me.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NDg2OTM0OTU4MzQ3ZGE4OWE5ZWUwYzZhMjVjOTYw"><span style="font-weight: 400">For that snowman, I might as well be a god.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNTUxMjQ3NWZkOTQ0YmE5OWJmODZiNDc3OGQzZDg0"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">But really, what makes me any different from this snowman?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnMyZTA3NjFjOWY4NTRiNWQ5MjM4YmI0OWZiYmZjNzQ4"><span style="font-weight: 400">In this world, where it was snowing, everything was real. Me, my house, my family, my friends, and everything else I can think about.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzODcwYmM2YzAzYjRjNjliMGFjYjkwNmU2NTg4NzZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Just like the snowman, I was stuck inside my own snow globe, watching the snow fall with a content smile. Everything that happened in this world wasn’t caused by nature, by some God, nor by an obscure force that no scientist could ever hope to uncover. It was a meticulously crafted system inside a computer somewhere. A system designed to trick us into thinking it was a fool’s errand to understand how it worked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NmY2Y2ZiNTliNjQyNGJhNThkZWUwMTJjNjAyN2M3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Now that I had seen a glimpse of the truth, I could no longer watch the snow fall passively without wondering who shook this snow globe and why.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZjVjZTM4ZjY3MTQ3ZDQ5ZmZiYjc3YjA0NGVhZDZh"><span style="font-weight: 400">I was no longer just another snowman.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NmUyNTkwYWFlZTQ4MjZiYjgyYzVkZDUyZjhiOWQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Why did this world exist?</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYThhODUwMTAyMDQyOGE4OGYwNDc1MzI2N2QxYTNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Who—or what—made it and for what purpose?</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMjE4YzBiZGQyNjQwNDE4MTM1MDM5NzE4OGY0NTlj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Why did angels exist?</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMjczYjk4NmM5NzRlODA4ZjQ4YzliOTRjOTA0ZjZh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Who were the archangels, and why didn’t they seem to care about killing a million people?</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MjkxZjNjMThjYjRiOTdiYzM0Njk2NzM0MTBlNTg4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Everything that happened had a cause. A cause I could understand with my feeble mind. Knowing that simple fact became crushing.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OWZkNDM0YzBhMTRmNWZhM2Y3OWExMTA5NzZkMjZl"><span style="font-weight: 400">A curse.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NzBiNzZhNzVmYjQwNTZiYzYyYTgzMzExMmI1NzU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">The curse of knowing that the world was much more than it appears. Yet, at the same time, it was much simpler than anyone believed. A world that was as fake as it was fragile.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZWRkMGM2OTVkNDQyNDZhMzVhYTUwNzgyZTUwZTFj"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">This was the curse Ayumi talked about. The curse of holding the knowledge and not being able to act upon it.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNmYWI0ZTEyZjIwYjQ4ZTBhZmY4ZDUxNjY1MTUwOWMw"><span style="font-weight: 400">But if I wanted to keep living, I would have to find an anchor amidst this sea of unknowns.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NDE2YjFkODY1YjQ1NDFhMTZmNjY5MTJlZmZkYjFi"><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought and thought about it. I spent many hours racking my brain, trying to figure out what I could latch onto.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjViYWU0OGY3MjQxZjE5NTdmMzc2YjhhMWVmMzFm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as I was about to give up, a lightbulb shone through the darkness.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMjljOTNkN2MzYjRkNTE5ZjAxMTYyNjEyZDFmODM4"><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, I felt as if I were Descartes when he wrote the Cogito.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYzE5ZDhiYjZkNDRmYWNhOTJhYjM2OTk1MDY2ZDY3"><span style="font-weight: 400">I decided on the two facts that would keep me sane.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZjA1YmMwZGJiYTRkMGJiZjU4ZTQzOGJhNGY0Y2Rk"><span style="font-weight: 400">First, that this world was real.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNjk5ODM5NzFkMjQyZWE5NWNjY2FmN2Y1NWE4YTk2"><span style="font-weight: 400">I was real, and so was everything around me. Even if it was a simulation, a copy of the real world, it felt real for those of us living in Gaia.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZDgzZTZiODI1MjQ2NDM5MTIyYzFjNjI4NWVmZDVj"><span style="font-weight: 400">The second fact, the saving grace—I was human.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYjcwYzBlNzViYTRhZWRiN2YzYjAzZmRjYjA4ZmY1"><span style="font-weight: 400">According to Ayumi, I was a human.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YTFmNGNjZDNjNTRkNTdiMzBlNTk0NzBmYmZjYzEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">If what she said was true, then everyone living in this simulation was human.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDI2Y2NhNWFiNDRjYjY5M2IzNjc3MDJmNWQyNTdj"><span style="font-weight: 400">As human as anyone living in the real world.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNjQzZjAzNTYyNDRiZThiZjQwMDk2ZGU0MjdhM2Ji"><span style="font-weight: 400">That included angels. Though they might be a bit more unique, they were humans like everyone else living on Earth. They weren’t simple cogs of a big machine someone could just throw away when they were no longer useful. They were worth protecting too.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMzZhNzJlZjlmODQ5N2E5ZTdhZWM4NDkzYzFiNDY5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Which just made the archangels’ actions even more perplexing.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNzA4OGU5Y2NhYzQwYmU5Y2QwYmRjYzRlOGQyYmZk"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was at this point my thoughts became increasingly chaotic. I thought about many things, and nothing at all, at the same time.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYzBkNDhiYzY2MDRmMTFiZDU0ZjI1OTQxZDg1NzQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, my tiredness took over, and I fell into a disturbed sleep, bringing my worries into the land of dreams.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNWI4NWQyZTIwYjQ5ZTlhODgzZmVlODdjZmQwN2Q3"> </p>
<p class="cnNmN2M2ZGQxYmFlMDQ0ZmM5MTM4ZTUxZWZmOWM5M2Fl"><span style="font-weight: 400">* * *</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzMyMjJlOTQyNzQzMThiY2E2MmUxYjMzZGE5MmZh"> </p>
<p class="cnMxNDRmNGIwNGJjZjRkMjhiOWQzYTYyZWRlMTdkMzE5"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">What’s the point of even being here?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnM4MjkzMWEyMGFhNTQ0Y2JhYTNlYTdhZTczZjdhZTBj"><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the question making the rounds in my mind as we took our first steps in an old—but to me quite familiar—house. Our boots left melting chunks of snow on the floor as a reminder of the fresh snowfall from last night. The faint winter light was weakened by the translucent paper panes covering the windows, giving the hallway a somber atmosphere. It felt like the house itself had absorbed my mood.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZGIyM2QyZThhZjRhZjlhYWQ4OTczMDU1YzA5YjFh"><span style="font-weight: 400">In stark contrast to my disposition, the short girl in front of me seemed to be in particularly high spirits—is what I would be saying, but Ayumi’s mood somehow didn’t quite feel right. Almost as if she was here out of obligation.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NWU2NzcwZDE0YTQ2ZGViZjZmOWZiODFjYWZkMTZh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Just like I was.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NTA3NTcxZjY3NDRlZTdiNDEzYjU5MTVmMTlkZGYz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, you’re particularly quiet today, Takkun. Usually you’d be complaining left and right about us coming here.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYzY2YjI4MjJlNTRkZjViN2ZiZTQ4NDI2OWIwYWIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her voice was the same as the Ayumi I’d ever known, but I couldn’t ever forget. This wasn’t the real Ayumi.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOWUzM2YyZTFjNDRiZjliNGE0M2RmYmY3MWQwOTZm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing as I didn’t respond, she called me again. “Takkun?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMTQ0ZDFlMGZlODQyOTZiNjNhODc0MGMyYWI3NjNm"><span style="font-weight: 400">I was so lost in thoughts all alone that it took a while to reply.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYWZkNDFiM2RkZjQ1MDU4MGZjMGRmYmJhODU3MDE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry. What were you saying?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NzY5OWU1NzgzNjQ5N2Y4YzhhZjk3YzlmNjlhZTU2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, you’re a bit strange today. What’s wrong?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDQzOTdmOWRmNzRiNjg4M2Q2YjMxZjMzNmFkNDU4"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Did she notice? She knows me this well, doesn’t she?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnM1OTFmZjlkOGM1ZTRiZWM5ZGU0M2RhMWUyYjlhNjBi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, I had a really bad night.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNGZlODQ2ZDEzMDRlNjViZGM4MjU1NDY5NTBiOGZm"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Actually, I’m just not sure what to say to you.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNlN2VmY2EyZWMxZDQ4ZDViNjlhNWVmYzdjNzU4MTUy"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">How should I act around you? I mean, the last memory I have of you was… but that wasn’t you.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNlZjk2ODY5ZDM4OTRiNDZiNzdlNTZmMGU2MDEyNmE3"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Gosh, how confusing can this get?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNkYTc5MWFlZGY0NTQ0MDM4MzdkZGQwYWVlNjRlN2Rj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You should have told me that before we came here! Hmm… should we go back home in that case? We can always come back another day.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OTExZjUxYmU5MTQzMGViYzg1MWIwMmEyNmFmYzE2"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s not like it matters anymore.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnM3MGZhMTIzMTNiYzRiMWE5NTkxMjI3Y2M0ZThhNGY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">I ended up accepting Ayumi’s proposal and, without ever making it beyond the hallway, we turned back the way we came.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYTI5NWI3MWI2OTRkMTk4MDlmNzk1Yjk4YWVkYzQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400">On the way down the hill, Ayumi began one of her usual ramblings. Maybe she was trying to cheer me up, but it had the opposite effect. I tried to pay attention to her, but I just couldn’t. It wasn’t because her topic wasn’t engaging or anything. I couldn’t listen to her voice.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZDAyYjQ3MTE1ODQxNjg4YWNjN2Y2N2U3OGFiMTM5"><span style="font-weight: 400">She was, by every single molecule, Ayumi. She looked the same, had the same voice and speech patterns. For those reasons, I was feeling quite flustered. Before, I found her behavior weird because I didn’t know the cause. Now that I knew the cause, and knew I could not do anything to change the situation, I was having trouble returning to normality.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDc2NjdhYzliZDQ4Y2E4MTgyMzIyNTlhNGUzZWRh"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Is this also part of the curse Ayumi talked about?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNiMmI3OGFjZTc2ODQzMGQ4ODFmYmZiM2VmNmRmZGVj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ayumi spent the rest of the journey home hopping around happily, almost as if she herself didn’t want to be there in the first place.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NGZiZmFhYTQ4MzQ2OTk5NzNiZjhhMTk5YmRiZGMy"><span style="font-weight: 400">My preposterous supernatural days were over. The world was stable once again, and it seems those beings were doing exactly what they should—keeping to themselves, hidden from normal folk.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOTIzNDJlMzYzZDQ4YjI4NzA4YjhiZGRkNzUzNTg4"><span style="font-weight: 400">While still having my mind absent from reality, I found myself thinking back to those women.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MjA1MjAzMmQ3ZTRiNDFiZDE3OGE0ODVlYjNkMmYz"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">What are they doing now?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnM0NjA3ZTgyNDI5NzRjMjFhOGY3MzBmOTEyODc4YmNm"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">How did they deal with the aftermath of the incident?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnM0NGY5YmIxM2I0MDQzMmI4NjYwYTY5MDEwOTQyMzc5"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder if they’ll ever pay me a visit.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnMyM2JhZGZmODAwYTQzZjJiZTkzODE4YTkzMzM0MzJh"><span style="font-weight: 400">At that last thought, I couldn’t help but grin widely, feeling somewhat nostalgic.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0Nzk1Zjk4OWU4YjRiOGU5YWNlMjQ1MWVlMzAyZTI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ayumi, with her keen senses, spotted my reaction right away. “Takkun, what is it? What are you thinking about?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Yzk2MzZhZDIxYzRmYjBiMWE5NGZmZmU3Mjc3NWJj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, nothing special.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYTcyYTYyNDE0YzQ4ODhiZDE3Y2MyOGQ4N2QyYzFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">As a sad smile made its way onto my face, I turned my gaze away from Ayumi’s dull green eyes to somewhere up in the sky.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYmY0NDFkM2M4NjRiNTliYmVhNDk3OWFkNjk3ZTcx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just thinking about a pair of angels.”</span></p>
