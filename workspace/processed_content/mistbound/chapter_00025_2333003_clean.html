   “Maeryn? Are you alright?” Dan asked, his eyes half-narrowed in concentration, as if recognizing that Maeryn absolutely wasn’t okay but unsure as to how.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I’m fine. Like I said, I’ll be right back.” She offered him a smile, doing her best to make it look genuine. She knew that she failed, judging from Dan’s expression, but he let the matter drop.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn walked over to the door, her heart pounding, and she opened it and walked through without hesitation. Beyond the doorway was a long stone corridor, plain and devoid of any decorations, wide enough for three people to walk shoulder-to-shoulder, with several solid stone doors lined up on both sides, and one at the end.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn closed the door behind her, took a deep breath, and focused. Graves had picked her out of them, recognizing that she had weapons and combat experience. The old man had picked her
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    specifically
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   because of that. Whatever needed to be put down would be
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    violent
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   , and might be strong. It was the only thing that made sense.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   So be it.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn moved quietly, lightly, towards the door at the end of the hallway. She flexed her arms and wrists, stretching them out in preparation for battle.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   She heard nothing at all in the corridor. Whatever was waiting for her was either sleeping, quiet in nature… or perhaps the doors were enchanted for silence. There was no way for her to tell.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Finally, she reached the last door at the end of the hall. It, like the others, looked as though it were sealed to prevent even air from escaping, though the handle felt like it moved easily enough. She pressed her ear against it briefly, hearing nothing.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn breathed deeply, tensing. Slowly, ever so slowly, she turned the handle, and opened the door.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The first thing she noticed was Mist flowing in a thin layer across the floor, and she jumped back in fright. She wouldn’t breathe it in! She refused! Maeryn was about to turn on her heels and run away when she realized that the Mist was collecting only a fingers’ width along the floor. The sight made her pause - this much Mist… wouldn’t be immediately dangerous. Not unless she were to get on her hands and knees and purposely try to suck it in.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Then Maeryn raised her eyes at what was within the room beyond, and she clapped a hand over her mouth so as not to scream.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Inside was a body. A dead one, standing upright. Its flesh was thin, gray, stinking with decay. Its bones were prominent, as though the body had died of starvation, and the skin at its face was tightly stretched across its skull. Its eyes, though… its eyeballs were gone. In the sockets were burning, supernaturally teal pinpricks of magical fire.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   It was an Undead, though Maeryn had no idea what kind. And it was staring right at her.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Then the creature lunged at her with unnatural speed, its hands raised and mouth opened wide as if it desired nothing more than to consume her.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn let out a tiny shriek even as she rapidly flashed mana into her right vambrace, extending the blade and swinging.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The Undead didn’t seem to care at all about the blade even as it flashed through the air and chopped off one of its arms. It collided with her, bowling her over and trying to pin her to the ground.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn’s mind flashed to one of her previous encounters with a Mistwarped wolf that had managed the same feat, and her body acted on muscle memory, rolling backwards as she got her feet between herself and the Undead and kicking it back off of her, launching it a meter or so past her.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn finished the backwards roll and came back to her feet before spinning around, heart thumping wildly and flooding her with adrenaline. Then she fell to her knees, gagging; there was a truly awful, noxious rotting odor in the air, strong enough that she couldn’t breathe. Her eyes locked onto a black liquid oozing out of the stump where she’d cut the Undead’s arm off.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn’s mind spun as it made connections - the Undead were dangerous because of the
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    disease
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   they spread! Not because they themselves were strong! But if she didn’t figure out how to breathe in the next few seconds, this one was going to kill her anyway!
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The Undead was rapidly getting on all of its remaining limbs, obviously about to launch itself at her again. She was out of time.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Lacking any better options, Maeryn buried her face into her stiff Zephyrian jacket, using it as a makeshift filter. It wasn’t great - she could still smell the amazingly powerful rot in the air - but it was lessened enough for her to take a deep breath and hold it. Thus fortified, Maeryn flashed mana into her other vambrace and fell into a ready stance.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Every book she’d ever read that contained the Undead - children’s stories, admittedly - said that the only way to put an Undead down for good was to burn them… but that would be a lot easier if she could cut off its limbs first. The Undead’s severed arm lay still where it had fallen, giving her a glimmer of hope. She could manage this. She had to.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The Undead leapt at her once more, but despite its unnatural speed, Maeryn had no problems at all dodging the completely telegraphed action. She sidestepped, allowing the Undead past her, and swung down with one of her blades, cutting through the other arm. The monster turned quickly - almost too quickly - but it seemed to lack any other ideas besides to attack head-on and try to bite her.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn’s other blade flashed, and the Undead’s head was neatly removed from its body, black ooze rapidly spreading from it too, and Maeryn rapidly jumped back to avoid letting it touch her. The body fell to the floor, completely lifeless and no longer animated by whatever strange necromantic magics that resided in the Undead’s skull. The head also fell to the floor, falling sideways. The teal flames in its otherwise empty eye sockets stared at Maeryn with the same intensity that it had had from the beginning.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   With enough distance, Maeryn could breathe. Barely. Now that the Undead threat had been more or less neutralized, she just needed to cast a fire spell and… huh?
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn narrowed her eyes, staring intently at the Undead skull. Sure enough, thin vapors of Mist were leaking from its mouth, even in this state. Maeryn sighed. “Dan was right, as usual. The Undead are making the Mist. This sucks.” She straightened up, took another deep breath, then spent a few moments kicking the various body parts into one pile. "I swear, I’m going to find something he’s wrong about one day, just for balance. And then I will never let him forget it."

<span>
   Once the deed was done, she retreated to a safe distance once again and spent a few moments drawing in the dregs of mana from the air around her into her body, forming the spell she wanted. The flame didn’t come quickly, but Maeryn had half-expected that. The time it took to cast always seemed to vary depending on how she felt. In the middle of combat, with her heart pumping and her emotions running high, fire would leap to her call. Now that the fight was over, though? Using fire for cleanup duty after the real excitement had passed? Of course it needed to be cajoled.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   There was a reason why the truly great fire mages in the stories were always hotheads, she guessed. For a moment, she wondered what it said about her that she’d learned fire magic so easily when joining the hunters. She didn’t
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    think
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   she was a hothead… but would anyone?
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Shaking her head of the silly train of thought, Maeryn retracted the blade in her left vambrace and flipped her palm upward as she felt the air begin to heat up, sparks manifesting and dancing in orbital patterns before they crashed together in the center, forming a rapidly-growing sphere of heat and flame. “
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Fireball.
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   ”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   She targeted the skull, as it was the obvious critical point of the Undead, and she watched dispassionately as the flame magic shot out precisely on target. The entirety of the Undead’s body was promptly engulfed in fire - and it took only half a minute for the body to burn completely to ashes, leaving not even bones behind. The black liquid it had oozed also vanished, evaporating into thin air, and the incredibly foul odor faded with it.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn stared at the ashes, slightly confused. There was no way the Fireball had been hot enough to completely cremate and destroy the bones of a human being. What was going on here? “Come to think of it, my blades shouldn’t have been able to cut through bone that easily, either. Do… does becoming Undead do something to the body, something that weakens flesh and bone?“ She shook her head. “Questions for later, and probably not that important. Point is, the Undead’s dead-dead. Time to get the Compendium and then get some answers.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   She walked cautiously into the room where the Undead had been, and grimaced when she saw another body, ravaged and torn apart, with lots of the muscle and flesh showing signs of having had massive bites taken out of it. The body was clutching an incredibly thick book in its right hand - no doubt, that was the Compendium.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   She sighed and crouched down, getting a good grip on the book and pulling. The corpse’s grip held tightly… until it finally gave way, rolling slightly. Just enough to reveal its face.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn stared at the face for a long moment, then took a deep breath and closed her eyes. “I really, really don’t like this…!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Grumpily, she stomped back through the corridor and flung open the door to the study, walking right up to Research Master Graves and jabbing a finger at him. At him, because she knew better than to try to touch him. “I have your book. You figured out that the Undead generate Mist. You tested the theory with an Undead here. It killed you, though you managed to trap it before you died. You stuck around as a ghost using some kind of weird necromancy. You decided to wait until Ernesto inevitably came to check on you. You want to give the Compendium to him so he can continue your work. Have I covered the important points?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Graves’ ghost blinked. “I, er, yes. Very accurately and succinctly summated.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Ernesto’s and Dan’s jaws dropped in sync.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I am officially out of patience,” Maeryn retorted bluntly. “The graveyards on the way up creeped me out, I just fought a Depths-damned
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Undead
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   , and I was not expecting to be part of a real life
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    ghost story
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   when I woke up this morning! So, in the interests of cutting to the point, do you have anything left to say to me before I let you have your
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    entirely predictable
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   emotional farewell to your favorite student?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Graves hesitated, clearly thrown off by Maeryn’s tirade. The calm and peaceful expression he’d worn earlier fell away into that of befuddled confusion. “I, ah… I would request that you take Ernesto under your wing? I assume you’re on a journey to defeat the Mist as well, and you’ll need his expertise.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Lovely. Figured as much. Yes, okay.” Maeryn whirled on Ernesto. “Welcome to the crew. Dan’s your boss, I’m Dan’s boss, your first job is reading the Compendium and figuring out basic necromancy.” She thrust the book into Ernesto’s arms, completely ignoring the gobsmacked expression on his face. “Right then. I’m just going to stand in the corner and scream internally for a while. Get on with your final goodbyes.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   She stomped over to the corner, leaned against the wall, and pressed her forehead to the cool stone. Depths-damned Undead. Depths-damned ghosts. This day couldn’t end fast enough.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   There was an awkward moment of silence, before Graves’ ghost coughed lightly. “Ah, she is right, you know. My time here is limited, and I really would like to ensure nothing remains unsaid between us, my boy.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “You… you’re really dead?” Ernesto whispered, looking up at his mentor.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I’m afraid so. I died about four days ago, killed by the Undead I was studying, just as the young captain deduced.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Ernesto clenched his eyes shut. “I… I should have come sooner! I thought you might’ve been in trouble, but…!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Graves glided over to the boy, no longer even pretending to walk. “The fault is not yours, my boy. I was the one who told you how long to wait. And it was my hubris that killed me. I underestimated how much strength my subject would have, and it broke free of the shackles I’d placed on it.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The assistant opened his eyes, looking up at his deceased mentor before looking down at the book in his arms. “Are you sure you want to leave the Compendium with me?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I’m sure.” The ghost said simply. “You are the only one I have ever met who strove to understand the dead like I did, who recognized even a fraction of the ways that death is a part of life. Take the Compendium, learn from it. Be better than me.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I… I will, Master. I promise.” Tears leaked from Ernesto’s eyes as he met Graves’ gaze again. “I’m going to miss you, Master.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Ah, my boy… have you forgotten? Even if you don’t see me, my spirit will be watching. And perhaps, one day, when your power grows, we might speak again. But for now, know that I am with you.” Graves’s form started to become translucent, and he let out an inaudible sigh. “Looks like my time is at its end. Do your best, Ernesto. I have faith in you. Help your new friends defeat the Mist, and grow wiser and stronger with your experiences.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Master… do you have to go already?” Ernesto pleaded.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I do. It is time.” Graves’s form was starting to thin out and become misty at the edges.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Then… okay. Okay. I won’t let you down.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Graves reached out, placing a wispy hand lightly against Ernesto’s cheek. The boy looked up at him even as frost bloomed on his hair and face from the barest touch of his mentor. “Ernesto, my boy… you never have.” And then the ghost’s image vanished, leaving behind an openly sobbing young man.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn waited for a good minute after the last traces of Research Master Graves vanished, feeling like interrupting the crying Ernesto would be incredibly insensitive, but… they couldn’t exactly wait all day, and she was starting to feel very awkward just waiting in the corner. She exchanged a look with Dan, who made an X with his arms and shook his head rapidly, vehemently refusing to get involved.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Great. He was leaving it to her. She made a face, before sighing and approaching the newest member of her crew. “Do you want me to show you where his body is? So you can lay him to rest properly?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Ernesto wiped his eyes with his sleeve roughly. “I… yes. Please.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “It’s not a pretty sight,” Maeryn warned.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I don’t care. I… I need to take care of him.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn relented, and walked with him to the cell that the Undead had been in. Ernesto handled it better than she expected, only taking a deep breath and whispering a grief-filled “Oh, Master…”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I’ll… leave you to it,” Maeryn murmured. “Do you want us to wait for you in the airship?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Yes, please. I’ll… be a couple of hours, but I’ll meet you there.” Ernesto’s hands clutched the Compendium tightly as he spoke, obviously drawing strength from its presence.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn nodded in acceptance, and walked away. “Come on, Dan. We’re going to wait in Stonewing.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “... Aye-aye, Captain,” Dan whispered.
  </span>
</p>
