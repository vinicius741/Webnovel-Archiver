   The morning after their sexcapades, Emma found it hard to look at Lunaria without remembering the previous night. However, a new problem quickly presented itself.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “Doesn’t it seem like all of the guards are looking strangely at us?” Emma asked as they walked through the city.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Lunaria raised an eyebrow. “If you say stuff like that, you might scare little Sora.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The girl in question shook her head. “I’m not scared. I have Emma to protect me, and…”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   She started to say something else, but the group was stopped in a plaza. The moment, they exited from a small street onto a larger one, there was an army of guards in front of them.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   A whole battalion of people in leather armor stood there. They were decked from head to toe in battle gear, and on each of their crest there was the symbol that they’d seen entering the city. Each of the men gripped a spear and shield.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma whipped around, pulling the little girl closer to her, but behind them, they found the exit was blocked by even more guards.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Lunaria looked up with a frown. On top of the roofs of the nearby buildings, large eagles stared down at them, and on their backs were riders who were armored with thick metal.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The dragon’s anger flared up. A steam of heat rose from around her with the beating of her heart. “Is this really how you want to play?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “Wait!” A voice in the battalion shouted. “We have no quarrel with you, dragon. We only wish for you to deliver that vampire.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma flinched as the words struck her.
   <em>
    That vampire?
   </em>
   The mere existence of her in this city had brought about this occasion. Had they already learned what she did before? Questions flooded her head. She’d definitely killed some people previously, but they were also going to kill her if given the chance. As proof, they’d all shot arrows at her. The first people she’d met after taking care of their troll problem also treated her with indignation.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The dragon scowled at the woman who’d raised her voice. “You have no quarrel with me? Are you joking? Any quarrel with her is a quarrel with me.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   With an exaggerated sigh, the woman stepped down from her perch on the back of a white mustang. White robes fluttered in the wind, and her claws clenched tightly together.

   The woman strode forward confidently, until she was the center of attention at the middle of the square. People opened up their windows in their houses to look at her, and the battalion remained silent in her presence. Her heels clacked against the ground in a smooth rhythm with her footsteps. She paused when she deemed herself a sufficient distance.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “Forgive my rudeness, Lunaria, Dragon of the Moon, but I can’t let this monster walk around in our city. Her visage strikes disgust inside of my core, and I can’t stand the sight of her.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma’s eyes widened. She’d never heard anyone be so openly rude towards her, nor did she imagine that someone that she’d never even met could have so much hate for her.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The voice of a little girl rose up. Sora’s voice screeched at the woman. “You’re all wrong! Emma’s not…”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma’s hand on her shoulder stopped the little girl from continuing. She knew it very well. Someone who hated something without reason couldn’t be reasoned into liking them.
   <em>
    Besides, it’s not like I didn’t give them a reason to hate me.
   </em>
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   <em>
   </em>
   “Silence girl. I know what ‘Emma’ is.” The girl’s claws wrenched against each other, creating an agonizing scratching sound like nails on a chalkboard. She moved her feet and began pacing back and fourth. “Emma is a disgusting wretch from the depths of malice.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The girl’s voice grew more fervent as she continued. “Her kind is that which hides in the shadows. They feast on the blood of the innocent like beasts. They’re completely heartless and soulless creatures. Vampires are the very bane of the light, and the enemy of Our Lady. As Her paladin...As a Silver-General, all who support this vampire are to be shunned.” Her silver claw lifted, until it was pointed directly at Sora. “And that includes you, little girl.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Karlack unsheathed herself and transformed into a maid in the same action to the surprise of the crowd. Without saying a word, she unleashed her whip, and it stretched high up into the air. The thing coiled around the neck of a bird above them. She grabbed onto Emma, and her whip became smaller as the two were launched into the air.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   It was the same effect of a bungee cord or a tight rubber band, and the two were sent careening towards the feathery monsters above them.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The sudden action completely took Emma off guard. She looked down to see the horse girl pick up Sora in her arm and leap between the two buildings on either side. She went up like a video game character, bouncing against each wall on the way up.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma tried to speak up or move, but Karlack maintained a strong grip on her. “We need to get out of here, right now.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “We can’t just leave Lunaria down there!”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Karlack threw Emma into the air towards another building before the vampire could protest more. The whip maid launched herself into the air and unleashed her whip towards the same building. It latched on and pulled her even faster towards Emma. The maid caught her in mid air before the two could land.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The horse girl was not far behind the two, and the birds reacted to their movements. They flapped their wings and took to the air, especially the one who had their neck thrashed by Karlack’s whip.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma looked towards the plaza and caught sight of the woman who called herself a Silver-General.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The woman showcased a sickening grin full of razor sharp teeth. She licked her lips and pointed with her hand. “After them!”
