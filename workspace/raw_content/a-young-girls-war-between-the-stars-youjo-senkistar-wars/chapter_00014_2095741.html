<p class="cnNiODdjMTkyNTU3YzQzMjFiZGJlMTYxZGFkOGIwZGNm" style="margin-bottom: 0">“You’re distracted,” Obi commented as I was forced to duck away from a swing I had failed to parry, her blue blade passing through the air where my head had been.</p>

<p class="cnM5YmRhMGRlODY1MTRhNGE4YmM4MjQ4YmZlNzcwNGFj" style="margin-bottom: 0">I rolled, swinging my silver-white blade at her ankles and forcing her to jump over, then dodge back as I followed up with a swipe at her knees with the blade in my other hand. “I’m thinking,” I admitted, snapping both blades into a cross-block to catch her overhand swing.</p>
<p class="cnM2YmQ4NDEwMTRmNjRlZTA4MWM5Yjk3OTEzMmVhZjg2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMxYmU2YTExMjgwODQ0ZWFiN2FhZmVmYmIxM2I4NzJm" style="margin-bottom: 0">Obi recovered quickly, pulling back and using her longer reach to probe my defenses. A little smirk pulled at her lips. “Yes, I could tell. You always get that constipated look when you do a big think.”</p>
<p class="cnNiM2ViZGZkOWUwYTQ2ODNiMmI0ZmY2OGU3MTMwMjcy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNlYjRiZmVjYjgyZTQyZmE5MzYwMDhmNDcxZTVkMGJi" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Consti-!” My eye twitched and I leapt at her, the older girl giggling as she batted away my blows, circling to the left as we moved around the ship’s small training space. “I do not.”</p>
<p class="cnM3YTk1MGMzMzkxMzQ5OGJiOWQwOWRmYjQxYzZlOWQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMzYzZmZmNmNzljMTQ3MzA4YjNmMDc1MTI4ZmEwZjk4" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Sure, sure,” she agreed, nodding, radiating <em>teasing</em><span style="font-style: normal"> as she did. “You want to talk about it, or do you want to keep going?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYmY3N2IyNDhkNjRlNWFiNWNiZDUwZGFlZmIxOTJl" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMyMTU0MTM4YTczZDQyODk5YmRhMmZmMjc5MDljNDk2" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">“Yes,” I grunted, snapping the ends of my lightsabers together and coming at her again as I worked my way through practicing with my tools. After all, what was the point of having different weapons for options if you never practiced with or used them? Obi didn’t mind at all, since it kept her own skills sharp against different weapon types than a standard lightsaber or sword equivalent.</p>
<p class="cnM4YWQ2MGRmOWQ3YTQ1ZjU4NTY2MmIyNWY2YWQ3YTkw" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMxY2NjZGQ3ZTYyYzQ5MDc4Njk1NzhlNzIyZjUwMDBh" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">“Go on then,” she encouraged, kicking out and nearly catching my knee as I danced back, pulling her leg out of the way just before the white-silver blade would have hit.</p>

Tell big sis!” I snorted softly and she let out a quiet, “Ufufu~,” once more reminding me why I called her Onee-san Kenobi in the privacy of my own mind sometimes. She was at that age where sometimes, her mood and the age gap between us left her acting in pretty much exactly that role… while other times, she could be an absolute </span><em>gremlin</em><span style="font-style: normal"> and a troublemaker when she wanted attention.</span></p>

I was forced to bring one of the saber blades around to protect the back of my head. “It looks like someone began preparing for this years ago. </span><span style="font-style: normal">There are tunnels under every major city, leading below every governmental building or stronghold. </span><em>New</em><span style="font-style: normal"> tunnels. Oh sure, they’re all labeled as things like ‘sewer maintenance access’ or ‘emergency evacuation route’ and the like, but none of them actually </span><em>connect</em><span style="font-style: normal"> to the buildings they pass beneath or near. It’s like they were left intentionally unfinished. The walls are thin though.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YzNkZjExZGQyMTRiZWJhNGYwYmFjYmJjNzI1YWE1" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM0ZGE4ZDViYzVkZDQ2ZWM5MjNkMTYwMTY4NjgzYWM1" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">Obi frowned as she came after me with a basic combination, swinging her saber in a very predictable pattern until the last second, when she changed the angle of her swing and I nearly missed a parry. “How thin?”</p>
<p class="cnM0YjM3Y2NjNjIzYTRlYzhhOGFlZTkwMjAxMDc3YWI1" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NTIzNmYwZGVjZTRlN2ViZjJhOWRmM2U0Mjc3ZjJl" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">“Thin enough that blasting charges could presumably breach them,” I answered, moving in close to try and get inside her reach. “Some of those tunnels are large enough to fit heavy equipment through. Others, big enough for people. Some just,” I twisted, letting a jab sail by to catch her on the wrist, bringing our score even again, “circle the building foundations, as though they were put there to make it easier to access the structural supports for quick demolition.”</p>
<p class="cnM1ZmQ1NWJkY2IyNDQwNWM5OTUwYmQyMDUzZjBjMmM2" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM2M2RjMWJhMDUwMjRjZDZhMjM1NzRkOWJkMWVmMTcx" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">Obi pulled back, shutting off her lightsaber and, when I saw she was calling a halt to training and not just trying for a fakeout, I shut off my own and stowed them as she did likewise. She gestured for me to follow and I did as she led me to the small galley. The older girl poured us both a cup of cold water before we moved into the rec room and took seats on the couch there.</p>
<p class="cnMwZWFkZjcwMjhiMDRkMDRiZjU0OTEwMzMyODcyODhh" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNjZmZkNTg2MTBmZTQxYjM5NjVmNjQ1NTFjNmMwMmU3" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">“That explains why they wanted the data hidden,” she murmured, sipping at her drink.</p>
<p class="cnNiYjhiNzlkNTBhZDRiOWQ4MjVkODIxMDRlNTI0ZDkz" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM4YmI2NGExOGE1MjRkOGY4ZjIwYWIxMWZkNDNmMTFj" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<em>No</em><span style="font-style: normal">,” I shook my head, and she raised an eyebrow. “It’s certainly damning by itself,” I admitted, “but that’s not why they tried to hide it.” Seeing her expectant look and feeling the girl’s impatience, I drew it out just a bit, enjoying her frustration as I sipped at my own water. </span><span style="font-style: normal">Finally, I lowered it to my lap and told her. “The job was big. Serenno isn’t the most developed planet, but it’s still too large a job for the local companies to handle. They had to call in </span><em>contractors</em><span style="font-style: normal"> from off-planet.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYzA4YWE5N2E2MzQ3MTE5MDc4MWE3OTk1ODQwZmNl" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM0N2QyM2EyOTg0NDQzOGU5ZGNlMGNlMTgyZWRjZDlj" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<span style="font-style: normal">That makes sense,” the brunette nodded. “But I don’t follow. What do contractors have to do with a cover-up?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMTZlZjI3OTQyNjQ2NTQ5MmYwODdmMzVkZWY5NGYz" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM0MDc3YmY3OGMwMDQ0MmZhM2JkNGVjOTk3ZDZhNzU1" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<em>Everything</em><span style="font-style: normal">.” At her raised eyebrow, I asked, “Suppose you’re engaged in a conspiracy to engage in a hostile takeover, but it requires a lot of work that you’re just not prepared or equipped to do. You need to bring in outside help to get the job done. Who do you look towards to hire, to keep the work quiet?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjQ0YWViNmQ0OTQ3NzZhOTI3ZjE4OTY4NGY0ZTZj" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM3ZTYwYTE2NmZkYzRjZThhZmU0Nzk4ODI1NjgyNWIx" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">“Wait, you’re saying… whoever is involved hired the people they’re working with?” Obi asked, a frown pulling at her lips as she did.</p>
<p class="cnMzNmExNTBhMWQ2MzQ4MGM4ZTRmNDVhYzdiN2ZhMTU0" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNiOTA0ZTE1Zjc2NTRlNzZhOGQwN2RhYmU5ZTkzOTUz" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<span style="font-style: normal">I think so. Who would be least likely to talk or leak the information, but someone invested in seeing the hostile takeover come to fruition? Someone already involved. With </span><em>skin in the game</em><span style="font-style: normal">, so to speak.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0M2M1YWJjNzQ0NDRlYmJiMzI2ZTg1YTAwNmJjY2Jk" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNhOWNmMWIzMWJlNzQ5OWE4MjNjMmU1NjQ5MmExOTky" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">Nodding, she took another sip before asking, “Then you know who they are?”</p>
<p class="cnM4YTI5YTA5MGMwODRhYWVhYTc1NDkwNDU3ZDA2MGNh" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMyM2IyNDRhZmJhODQzYWE4YTZmYzRiNGJhM2JkYjgz" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<span style="font-style: normal">Better.” I began ticking off points on my fingers. “I know who hired them. How much the contract was for—</span><em>a lot</em><span style="font-style: normal">, mind you. Something like five times market value, in fact. I know who owns those companies, and </span><em>who owns them—</em><span style="font-style: normal">or at least, who’s pulling the strings. Charitable donations, tax records, campaign contributions, these things are all </span><em>publicly available information</em><span style="font-style: normal">.”</span></p>

<p class="cnNiMjgxNWUzZTMzYjQzODY5NWY2MTljYTFkNTkwNGEw" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">“Well, don’t keep me in suspense,” she huffed.</p>

<p class="cnNlMTBiOTIwYjI2ZjRlNmRiOWZmZDdkZTI2MGEyMzIy" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal">Obi nodded, finishing off her water. “So now we know the senate, Trade Federation, and Banking Clan are involved in the events on Serenno. I’m sure the </span><span style="font-style: normal">m</span><span style="font-style: normal">asters suspected. Is that what was troubling you?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYzgzMmJlMTViOTQ5OWY5YjdkNmVjNmFmODY4ZTQ4" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNiMDI3MzIxYTVhNDRlZWNiMjkzOWZhYjc5M2I2Mzg2" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">I shook my head. “No, but I needed to lay the groundwork for the actual problem.”</p>

<p class="cnM5NjZiY2YzMjQwMTQzZDE4OGVjZTljZWQzNDVhNzE4" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNlZWVlOWQ0YmE4OTRhYzFiYjQwYzI1MDI0M2YzMWFj" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">“Why?” Obi echoed curiously.</p>
<p class="cnNjZGFiMjkyMWRjNDRiMjY5YzA1MmFiODQyOGQ3ZWRk" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNmZDdjZTdiYjBmNzRiNzA4MTlhMmNkNzE5ZDY3ZDlj" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<span style="font-style: normal">Why Serenno? It’s an Outer Rim planet with little in the way of value to the Trade Federation. They aren’t on the list of big exporters to the Core.” </span><span style="font-style: normal">Sighing in frustration, I brought a hand up to scrub through my white hair. “Space combat isn’t like ground, sea, or air combat! Space is huge. You can’t just… pick a town along a major highway and turn it into a choke point, or set up a naval blockade of a river and cut off supplies to everything downstream, or just shoot everything flying down and claim air superiority allowing you to shoot at enemies on the ground and water with near impunity. If something’s in the way in space, you just </span><em>go around it</em><span style="font-style: normal">! And then there’s hyperspace! You can’t blockade hyperspace! It’s not possible—”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YTcwMjJhN2RmODQxYThhZDhlMTg4M2NkNmQ5ZjNi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM5NzMzYTE1ODk3MTRkMTdhNTYzZDJhYmUzYmZlYWQ0" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Uhh,” Obi murmured, and I blinked, pulled out of my building rant. “You’ve never heard of an interdictor then?”</p>
<p class="cnNkMmM5MmE4YTZiZTRjZWQ4Yjk3ZTMxZjExNTZhMDg2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM4NDFhYjgxNGIzMjRhMmY5ODEwN2FjMzJiMTNkNTQ2" style="margin-bottom: 0">“…A what?” I asked, my gut twisting as my mind raced ahead, breaking down the root word. Interdictor. <em>Interdiction</em><span style="font-style: normal">. </span><em>Interdict</em><span style="font-style: normal">. </span><em>To destroy, damage, or cut off, such as an enemy supply line, by means of firepower</em><span style="font-style: normal">.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNjhlZGViOGZkNDQ5ZDlhMTE0MmQ3N2NjYzUyOWVh" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNkZDI4Y2I0OTIwNTQ4NmRiMDA0MzZiMmFlMWNhZGJk" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<span style="font-style: normal">An interdictor is a kind of ship that produces an </span><em>interdiction field</em><span style="font-style: normal">. Clever name, right?” Obi chuckled. “They’re </span><em>super illegal</em><span style="font-style: normal"> for anyone but the Republic Navy to own, because pirates use them to take over trade lanes and force ships to drop out of hyperspace. Not </span><em>exactly</em><span style="font-style: normal"> sure how it works, but it trips the hyperdrive fail-safe to not, you know, </span><em>fly into a planet or a star</em><span style="font-style: normal">. </span><span style="font-style: normal">It’s not exactly new technology either.”</span></p>

She followed a moment later as I sat down in front of my computer.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMDA0MDhkZTQxNTQ1MDNiMmI4NTMwZTNhNzY0ODEx" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMzYTZmZjEzZGI5NTRhOTliZDA1OTZmYmJlYmE5NzIy" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">“What are you doing?” Obi asked, as I began putting in data requests.</p>

<p class="cnM2NDg4N2MzMjNhYjQ3NmRiY2Y0YWMzZDY5YWJjMjQ4" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">I answered as I worked, fingers flying over the keyboard. “Putting in a request for data. I need all of the planets the Trade Federation have blockaded.”</p>

<p class="cnNhY2Q1YzY0YmQzMjQwOGNhYmIyYjFjNjBmZGMxN2Ew" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">I held up a finger to indicate she should wait. Obi shrugged and moved away, dropping on my bed and looking around idly. Eventually, I finished what I was doing—now I just had to wait for the data to come back. Until then, I took what I had already—taking a galaxy map and dropping in the names of every planet I was aware of that the Trade Federation had blockaded, along with Serenno. My list wasn’t comprehensive or up to date—it was at least a year out of date, in fact. But it was a good start. Good enough to see the pattern starting to form.</p>

Blockade every major route with a fleet and interdictors and force everyone going through to pass through their checkpoint. Conduct inspections. Demand ‘fees’ to pass. Disallow certain things to go Coreward entirely. </span><span style="font-style: normal">It wouldn’t completely cut off the Core, obviously. </span><span style="font-style: normal">There are still several agri-worlds in the core, or very close to it, that are used to feed Coruscant and other planets entirely dependent upon imports.

Taking a breath, I opened myself and reached out, at the same time I focused on the orb and what I needed to do to make it work.

From there, we could coordinate an assault on either the front or rear entrance, or<em> both</em><span style="font-style: normal"> simultaneously,</span><em> </em>and I could attack the defenders from behind while they’re distracted.

We’ll descend to the planet in a few hours, in time to coincide with the morning on the continent where this meeting is taking place. In the meantime, I will get in touch with our contacts on the surface and arrange for some things.”</p>

Putting the laptop on my desk, I was unsurprised when Obi joined me a few moments later, carrying her candles. Looking up, I found her smiling as she set them up and patted the rug beside her when she sat.</p>

I don’t agree with everything the High Council is worrying about, but I have to ask, is she going to be okay, psychologically speaking?

Less certain than anything I’ve tried to view before. The coming war? That may as well be set in stone.” Frowning, he murmured, “There was </span><em>one</em><span style="font-style: normal"> thing that bothered me.

For now, let us worry about securing the aid of the Mandalorians and dealing with the situation on Serenno.” Master Dyas made to speak, but Dooku held up a hand. “If she were at all unsure about going into combat, I’m sure Tanya would have said so.
