   The days passed slowly but surely as Stonewing

   made its way steadily towards Zephyr. Everyone more or less kept to themselves for the trip - Dan and Ernesto only emerged from the lab to eat and sleep; Frankie and Peter stayed in the cockpit for the most part, keeping each other company and sleeping in the chairs when they needed to; and Terrance and Parlor rarely emerged from their rooms at all.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance didn’t mind explaining his perspective on the third day of the trip when Maeryn asked him over dinner what exactly he did all day. “It’s nothing too special. Just meditation, stretches, and dexterity exercises.” He waggled his fingers in front of Maeryn expressively. “You know how I picked that lock back on Airspire? That kind of thing takes a very light touch, and a calm mind. Get too anxious, and your own heartbeat interferes with things. Meditation helps with that. The more I am aware of my own body, the more control I have over myself, you know?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “That’s…” Maeryn shook her head, speechless for a moment. “That’s really admirable. How long have you been doing that?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance looked away. “About as long as I can remember,” he admitted. “You know how I said I was kinda pushed into being a rogue? I meant it. I can’t really remember a time I didn’t have a routine like this. Only thing missing is sparring, but we don’t really have the space to do that on board.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Oh.” That was… a lot sadder than Maeryn had expected. “I’m sorry.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “It’s fine. I’ve made my peace with it. Besides, I like being good at what I do.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “It sounds kind of lonely, though,” Maeryn muttered. She jerked her head up a moment later as an idea occurred to her. “Do you maybe want to try meditating and stretching together sometime?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance blinked, clearly taken aback. “I, uh… maybe? I mean, having a partner would make some of the stretches more effective, I guess. But you do realize that you’re going to be sore for days until you get used to it?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn shrugged. “Wouldn’t be the first time I had to acclimate to new exercises. Hunter, remember?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “True enough. Then, tomorrow after breakfast?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Sounds great.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Starting on the fourth day, Maeryn found she had almost no time to be bored at all. Breakfast, followed by stretches and meditation with Terrance - and he hadn’t been kidding about being sore afterwards, her calves and glutes ached fiercely after every session
  </span>

<span>

<span>
   - then a light lunch, an hour’s practice on her guitar, a couple of hours’ study, dinner, and then checking in on everyone before collapsing in bed from mental and physical exhaustion.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn was almost glad when they finally approached Zephyr if only for a change of pace late in the afternoon on the sixth day. Her first impression: Zephyr was big. Really, really big. Bigger than Airspire by far. It seemed too large to call a city, even. Honestly, Maeryn had no idea what monstrosity of steam and magics allowed the capital to stay aloft. It was no wonder a lot of Geovans thought that the Zephyrians were responsible for the mana shortage; Maeryn herself was sorely tempted to ask Dan to see if they could measure how much magic Zephyr consumed.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Was Vert even this big? Maeryn had her doubts.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Zephyr looked as though the Zephyrians had just scooped a giant chunk of the ground out of the planet, smoothed out the bottom into a vague oval shape, and made it fly. A giant palace marked the exact center of the city, surrounded by extravagantly decorated buildings. All of those inner buildings were wrapped behind a wall, and everyone on the outside was divided into dozens of districts. Enormous farms, warehouses, what had to be a school for airship professions, the airfield itself - everything was big about this place.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn was still trying to shake off her awe and intimidation when they came in for a landing. The visibly armed guards approaching Stonewing
  </span>
<em>
<span>
</span>
</em>
<span>
   alongside a pair of administrators quickly got her attention, however. One of them - a bald, heavily tanned middle-aged man with no facial hair at all - wore the same uniform Lyra had worn back on Cloudreach, so Maeryn surmised that this was the Skymaster and his assistant.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Your name, your airship’s name, and city of origin?” the Skymaster asked boredly.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Captain Maeryn, Stonewing, and we just came from Airspire,” Maeryn replied
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The assistant - a teenage boy with strawberry blond hair - quickly jotted down the information on a paper on his clipboard.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Reason for your visit?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Escort mission for Samuel Parlor.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Parlor… Parlor…” the Skymaster repeated softly. “The name’s familiar. Boy, are we expecting any Parlors?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Sir!” the boy squeaked, quickly flipping through his clipboard. “Yes! Yes, sir, he’s on the list!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Very well, then.” The Skymaster waved his hand dismissively, apparently losing all interest. “The boy will get your paperwork sorted. Hurry up and get off my airfield.” He stalked off to where another airship was landing, the guards following him. Maeryn watched as another assistant - a young lady this time - hurried to meet him from the giant office at the edge of the airfield.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Huh. Pretty busy today.”
  </span>
</p>
<span>
<br/>

  <br/>
</span>
<p>
<span>
   “It’s always like this,” the boy admitted. “Right. Um, so, how long are you staying?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Three days.” Samuel Parlor’s voice came from behind Maeryn, and she almost jumped at how quiet he’d been. “With option to extend.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Yes, sir. Anything to declare?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Nothing from me. Captain?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn shook her head. “Nothing here either unless you’re counting alchemical materials, which won’t leave the ship.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “That’s a no,” the boy muttered as he quickly made a couple of marks. “Permission to inspect and perform any necessary repairs?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Denied!” Frankie chimed in loudly from inside Stonewing.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The boy blinked, then looked at Maeryn. “Um, Captain?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “That’s my primary engineer. I better listen to her. So, no.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The boy chuckled. “Yeah, better not to anger the person who makes your airship run.” He finished making a few more marks, then nodded briskly. “That should be it. Enjoy your stay! I gotta go turn this in and get ready for the next one.” He dashed off without giving them a chance to say anything more.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Parlor nodded briskly and began striding away, leaving Maeryn and her crew to hurry after him.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The nobleman moved through the streets like he’d grown up on Zephyr, walking quickly and confidently until they reached a massive building with giant letters declaring it
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Varia Hotel &amp; Suites
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   . “This’ll do,” Parlor said matter-of-factly, opening the door. Then he paused and looked back at the crew. “Wait here. There’s no point bringing everyone inside if they don’t have room.” And then he vanished into the building.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “A place like this can run out of room?” Dan muttered disbelievingly.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance snorted. “Of course it can. If the rooms are big enough. This is obviously a hotel meant for the rich and famous.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Are we really going to stay here?” Ernesto asked in wonder.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Maybe. We need to wait and see, I suppose,” Maeryn answered, effectively putting a halt to the conversation. They stuck out enough as it was, and she didn’t want people overhearing them being completely out of place.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Parlor reemerged from the building several minutes later, holding three keys with tags on them. He handed them over to Maeryn promptly. “There are three rooms, each with two beds and basic amenities. I don’t care how you divide them amongst yourselves. Breakfast is free, and you can order whatever you like from room service for lunch and dinner. If I need you for whatever reason, I’ll get a message to the front desk, so you should check in regularly. Any questions?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn blinked, but shook her head. “No, I think that covers everything.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Very good. Then I’ll see you when my business is complete.” Parlor nodded at Maeryn respectfully, then turned on his heel and strode away, leaving them behind.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “... Wait. He’s not staying here?” Frankie asked disbelievingly.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Of course not.” Terrance sighed, clearly done with the day just from the sound of his voice. “It’s the basics of noble appearances; you don’t stay at the same place as the help. He’ll be finding an even fancier place further in.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “So it’s just a ‘I’m better than you’ thing?” Frankie huffed in indignation. “Rude!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance shook his head. “There’s a lot more to it than that. Yeah, there’s some classism - okay, a lot of classism - but it’s also to keep working folks from being unduly impacted. You don’t get it, the world of nobility is cutthroat. The richer you are, the more powerful you are, the more you get targeted by people who want what you have. By keeping his distance, he’s protecting himself
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    and
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   us.” He took a deep breath and released it slowly. “It’s really, really complicated. And stupid at times. But I’m positive he wasn’t trying to insult us.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “We can discuss it more later. Right now we’re outside and drawing attention,” Maeryn cut them off decisively. “We need to figure out how we’re dividing the rooms and go see what we’ve got. Anyone have a preference on partners?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Ernesto’s with me,” Dan immediately answered. Ernesto’s little nod of acceptance made it simple, and Maeryn passed them one of the keys. They immediately walked inside, disappearing from view.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   When no one else volunteered, Maeryn raised an eyebrow and glanced around. Terrance was watching Frankie, his lips twitching as he barely bothered to restrain his amusement. Peter was also looking to her for guidance. Frankie herself looked rather on the spot, glancing between Peter and Maeryn.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   It was then that the hunter understood: Frankie had to decide whether to partner with her boyfriend - even if they hadn’t become an official couple yet - or play it safe with Maeryn and leave Peter to Terrance’s debatable mercy.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn repressed a smile, and decided to save her friend this time. “We’ll split by girls and boys to make it easy. Frankie, you’re with me. Terrance, you’re with Peter.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Works for me.” Terrance idly snagged one of the keys from Maeryn’s hands. “Come on, lover boy.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “W-what?!” Peter’s face flushed bright red even as he followed Terrance inside. “I’m not…!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Frankie also pinked, and glared slightly at Maeryn. “You know how I said that he might be a good friend to you? I take it all back. He’s awful.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn chuckled. “Come on, Frankie. Let’s go check out our room.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The engineer followed her inside, still grumbling under her breath. Maeryn inhaled sharply upon entering - the place looked
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    lavish
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   . A beautifully sculpted spiral staircase wide enough for eight people to ascend at a time, a floor that was so clean that it reflected the lights that decorated the walls, a dining hall larger than Stonewing itself… even the receptionists were dressed in clothes more fine than any Maeryn actually owned. Everything about the place screamed “high class”, and she abruptly felt distinctly out of place.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Which, she guessed, was the point.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn spotted Terrance and Peter heading up the stairs, and headed that way as well, glancing at the tag on her key. “Room 401.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “There’s more than four hundred rooms here?” Frankie breathed.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Maybe? But if I were a betting girl, I’d say that the first number means what floor you’re on. Let’s go.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn’s supposition paid off - they were indeed on the fourth floor, at the end of the hallway. The room itself was significantly less grand than the rest of the hotel, but there were only so many ways one could upscale a room with two large beds, a fancy dresser and closet, and a sparklingly clean bathroom.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Frankie looked hesitant to even sit on her bed. “I… think I should probably shower before I touch anything,” she muttered.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Not a bad idea,” Maeryn admitted. “Afterwards, we can figure out what we’re doing while we wait for Parlor to finish with his business deal.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   They’d only be on Zephyr for three days, if everything went well. That wasn’t enough time to explore everything, but there was one place that Maeryn was dead set on visiting: the airship academy.
  </span>
