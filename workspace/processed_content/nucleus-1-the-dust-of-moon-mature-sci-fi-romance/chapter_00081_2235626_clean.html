 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Near Kama Darshana (काम दर्शन), The Twilight Expanse, Shashan
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin gripped the small vial in his right hand. The purple liquid swirled inside, offering no comfort. He glanced up at Chandrak, the massive gas giant descending toward the horizon. The sun on this distant planet was noticeably smaller than Earth's, evidently a red dwarf, its soft light shining over the purple plants covering the ground.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I should have made Kathrin stay and speak for herself. Why didn't I?" Xin muttered as he walked toward the meeting spot with Emmanuel and Tanha. "No, this is all my fault. Trying to become psionic…"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He looked at his Quantum Watch. After arguing with Lorna earlier, he had gone back to retrieve it from the Scepter Grove. The watch's green display flickered to life, projecting a holographic arrow showing him which direction to go in Devavāṇī: 'Kama Darshana (काम दर्शन)'.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Only this time, he found himself no longer needing translation to understand what it meant: 'Vision of Desire'.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   In the distance, he heard two people laughing.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin reached a small hill and saw Emmanuel and Tanha lounging on the purple grass. Emmanuel's muscular dark form contrasted with his purple botanical skirt. Tanha's violet body was covered with deep purple vines that worked like natural clothing.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Well, if it isn't our most-celebrated Imperial rebel," Emmanuel called out. "Come to join the show?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Tanha giggled, her purple eyes glowing. "We were just debating who'd make a better Imperium spy," she said, running a finger along Emmanuel's chest.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin forced a smile and sat down beside them. "And the verdict?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Emmanuel chuckled, his hand touching Tanha's hip. "I say I'd blend in better with my military background. Tanha thinks her... talents... would be more effective."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Oh please," Tanha said playfully, her purple hair shimmering. "I've been a human until seven years ago. One bat of my eyelashes and I'd have the Emperor eating his own hand."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin looked at the horizon, where Chandrak's blue mass dominated the sky. "That is, if your talents are able to reach him."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Emmanuel frowned, studying Xin's face. "Speaking of talents, where's Lorna? Not feeling well?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin's chest tightened as he traced the edge of his watch. "It's... my fault. I wasn't strong enough to keep her heart."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Emmanuel leaned forward. "Look, Xin, you can't blame yourself. Lorna can be fickle sometimes. Unpredictable. It's just her nature."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Something snapped inside Xin. "No," he said sharply. "It's not Lorna's fault. It was me. I was not able to resist…temptations."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Tanha snorted, her eyes narrowing. "You just know he's an Imperial by how sentimental he gets all of a sudden," she said with disdain.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin's jaw clenched, feeling angry and sad. He wanted to defend Lorna, but he couldn't find the words.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A thunderous rumble broke the silence, vibrating through the purple grass. Xin looked up, adjusting his glasses as he scanned the area.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   There, coming through the mist on the horizon, a Space Rover raced toward them.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The vehicle's white exterior was now covered with alien vines that seemed alive. But what alarmed Xin was the dark substance splattered across the side door.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Buddha's balls!" Xin hissed, reaching for his watch. "What's she thinking?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Is that..." Emmanuel's voice trailed off as he tensed.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin nodded grimly. "Blood. And not human."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As if drawn by the scent of violence, monsters began to appear from the shadows. Jalraks, scorpion-like creatures, surrounded the approaching Rover. Alongside them, Trishuls slithered into position, their fangs glistening.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Lorna," Xin whispered, his heart pounding. Was she in that Rover? Had she come back for him?
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Jalraks and Trishuls closed in on the vehicle. Then, with a mechanical whine, the Rover's Gauss Machine Gun roared to life.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The gun's projectiles tore through the attacking creatures. Xin watched as Jalraks and Trishuls were shredded into bloody piles.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What kind of kutta," Tanha hissed. "Well, don't just stand there. Stop it!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin's mind raced. The reckless driving, the blood-splattered exterior, the determination to push through monster territory - it all pointed to Lorna. He remembered her driving style from their morning lesson, a mix of precision and controlled chaos.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He stood up, his botanical skirt rustling against his legs. His fingers trembled as he reached for the Indra-Sprite in his pouch.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin drank the purple liquid, which tasted like starlight and distant memories. He felt his awareness expanding as unfamiliar energy flowed through him. The boundaries between himself and the world blurred.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A green energy orb formed in his palms as he raised both hands.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "*Aar-ya Maa-truh Kath-rin. Aap-ka Vi-nee-ta Shish-ya, Aap-ko Aa-hvaan Kar-taa Hoon!*" He whispered into the orb, the words flowing naturally.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   His temple pulsed, and he felt Kathrin's presence touch his mind. "*Dhairyaṃ Rakho, Yuvak Xin. Maiṃ Ā Rahī Hūṃ.*"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Shortly after, Kathrin appeared beside him in a shimmer of energy. Her white skin gleamed, tentacles moving gently around her body.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Rover," Xin gasped, pointing toward the vehicle. "We have to stop it, but Lorna might be inside."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kathrin's forked tongue flicked out. "I sense her presence," she confirmed in her British accent. "Her aura is chaotic and clouded by blind rage."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin's heart clenched. "What can we do?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kathrin's eyes narrowed as she stood beside him. "We must stop the Rover without harming her. I will guide you."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "We?" Xin was surprised. "I am not psionic."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You recently exchanged Aether with someone who is," Kathrin smiled mysteriously as she took his hand and lifted it.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin felt himself blush at Kathrin's touch. "Yes, I did."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The first time may be disorienting," Kathrin warned as her tentacles wove a pattern in the air, trailing green energy. "Focus on what you want to do rather than who you are."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Alright," Xin felt something stirring within him as he extended his hand toward the approaching Rover.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The words should come to you now," she instructed. "Channel your energy. Visualize it stopping the Rover."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin closed his eyes, focusing on the connection between himself and Kathrin. He poured his energy into the strands. "Jāḍya Jāla Sthiram!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   With Kathrin's guidance, an energy web shot from his fingertips, expanding as it engulfed the Rover.
  </span>
 </p>
 <span>
  <br/>
  If you encounter this tale on Amazon, note that it's taken without the author's consent. Report it.
  <br/>
 </span>
 <p>
  <span>
   The web expanded, but Lorna's power pushed against it. The Rover fought against his spell, its wheels spinning faster.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Pain shot through Xin's palm and up his arm like fire. Blood began to seep from under his fingernails, running down his hands. Yet Xin stood firm.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin's hands shook with sweat and blood as he felt the Rover pushing harder. But even as Lorna drove faster, he held on.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Kathrin," he said through gritted teeth. "It hurts...but I won't let go. I will hold."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I have faith in you," she replied, holding his wrist.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The pain spread across his chest. Xin's vision blurred, but he put more of himself into the spell. Through the connection, he felt Lorna's fury, her pain, her longing. It matched his own.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kathrin's grip tightened, her cool touch contrasting with the burning feeling inside him. "Focus, young one," she commanded. "Remember not who you are, but what you're doing."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin felt energy from Kathrin, cool and controlled, mixing with his own chaotic power. He leaned on her, his body shaking, as their combined force pushed against Lorna's advance.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The strain was immense. Xin's legs nearly gave out, and Kathrin had to support him. He gasped for breath. Tears ran down his face, evaporating in the heat of the Void energy around them.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I must...hold on!" Xin opened his eyes and choked out, feeling like he was being torn apart.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You can, and you will," Kathrin insisted, her voice strained. Her tentacles wrapped around Xin, supporting him.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Finally, the vehicle's wheels spun against the purple grass, but the web held, gradually slowing it until it stopped a few meters away.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Then, Kathrin's white fingers wrapped around Xin's palm as she said, "Sandhāna."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A soft purple light surrounded Xin, easing the pain and stopping the bleeding. Panting, he said, "Thank you."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kathrin nodded. "Your mind is your strongest weapon," Her eyes met his, showing concern and approval. "Never doubt it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna's angry voice came from the Rover. "Give me back my fucking pendant, or I'll raze this entire moon to ashes!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin flinched at her fury, his palm tingling. He wanted to rush to her, to calm her, but Kathrin's tentacles on his shoulder held him back.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Lorna," Kathrin replied calmly. "Primarch Moro has it. The Pendant of Mánagrát. It will be returned to you in a few days, once he's finished his inspection."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Bullshit!" Lorna's curse shrieked from the Alliance vehicle, making Xin wince. "I want it now, you mutated little dritt! You have no right — "
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Primarch has every right," Kathrin said smoothly. "As leader of the Rakshasa Horde, it's his duty to investigate potential threats."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You…took it?" Xin's mind raced. He'd seen her touch it when thinking deeply. "What could be so dangerous about Lorna's pendant? Maybe you should've asked first?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna's rage grew. The Rover shook, and Xin, now with some of Kathrin's psionic energy in him, could feel Lorna's power building inside the vehicle, like it might explode.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That. Pendant. Is. Mine!" Lorna snarled. "And I want it back. Now!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin's heart raced. His fingers twitched, wanting to use his watch to reach her somehow.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kathrin remained calm. "Lorna, I suggest you rest for the night at Lustsong Woods. Tomorrow, we can discuss this with Moro."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Fuck your civility!" Lorna spat. "I'm not waiting another goddamn minute."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin felt torn between the Rakshasa Horde and his feelings for Lorna. He wanted to speak, to reason with both sides, but couldn't find the words.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Space Rover's door burst open with a bang, startling Xin. His breath caught as Lorna emerged, fierce and powerful. Her blonde hair whipped behind her, blue eyes blazing.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Lorna, wait!" Xin called out, but his voice was lost in the noise.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She moved quickly, her beige trench coat flowing as she activated her Psytum Sword. The blue blade hummed to life, casting light on her determined face. Without hesitation, she attacked the two Trishuls blocking her path.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Buddha be praised," Xin muttered, wincing as Lorna's blade cut through the creatures. The Trishuls' dying shrieks filled the air, but Lorna didn't flinch.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As she charged forward, Emmanuel's deep voice called out. "N-soo-oh eh-dah meh hoh!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A shimmering barrier of moonlight appeared before her, Emmanuel concentrating hard.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Tanha. Defensive spells only," Kathrin reminded, her tentacles still on Xin's shoulder.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Darpaṇa Māyājāla!" Tanha's form multiplied, surrounding Lorna with identical violet copies.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin's heart raced. He wanted to step in, to protect Lorna, but knew he was outmatched. "Dammit, there has to be another way," he said frantically.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna's voice cut through the chaos. "Get out of my fucking way!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   To Xin's amazement and horror, she broke through Emmanuel's barrier, the moonlight shattering around her. Tanha's illusions disappeared as Lorna swung her sword, unable to withstand her determination.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I will withstand her attacks. Find a way to drain her energy from within," Kathrin said, moving toward Lorna with her tentacles extended.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Drain her energy? From within?" Xin tensed, ready for violence as Kathrin moved away.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He watched as green mist came from Kathrin's tentacles, her voice echoing: "Om Tare Tuttare Phat."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Suddenly, a green lotus-shaped shield formed around Kathrin, protecting her completely.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna hesitated, her fierce expression faltering. "Just die, damn you!" she growled as her sword struck the shield without breaking it.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Hurry, young one. My energy won't last long," Kathrin said to Xin while maintaining her shield.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "From within," Xin realized as he spotted the Psi Shield Device on Lorna's ear. She was using her own Aether to power it, the same energy that fueled her attacks. This was how he could stop her without hurting her.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin worked his Quantum Watch, connecting to Lorna's device. "Come on, come on," he muttered, bypassing security with the password: 'schwzKuk21'.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As he got into the device's code, Xin saw the streams of energy, Lorna's Aether, powering the shield. With a few movements, he rerouted the energy flow, creating a loop that fed back into itself.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "There it is," he whispered, starting the loop.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The air around Lorna began to shimmer. The Psi Shield, normally invisible, appeared in bright blue light. It expanded rapidly, becoming an impenetrable cocoon that consumed her energy.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna's eyes widened in shock as the shield grew stronger. The energy crackled, drawing more and more of her Aether.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What... is... happening?" she gasped, suddenly tired.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin watched as Lorna paled, her movements slowing. Her Psytum Sword flickered and went out, the hilt slipping from her hand. The shield continued to brighten, now illuminating the whole area.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I'm sorry, Lorna. But you'll be okay," Xin said softly, his heart heavy as he saw what the energy drain was doing to her.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna's knees buckled, her body unable to sustain the massive drain on her energy. Her eyes closed as the last of her Aether was drained, the shield around her fading.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin rushed forward to catch her before she fell. Her skin pulsed with fading blue light as she lost consciousness.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He caught Lorna, her weight solid against his chest. The smell of her sweat, mixed with ozone and something uniquely hers, filled his nose. His heart pounded with concern and desire.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It's okay, Lorna. We're here," he whispered, holding her head. Her blonde hair spilled across his arm.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   With Lorna's shield gone, Kathrin moved forward, her tentacles retracting. She knelt beside them, placing a white hand on Lorna's forehead.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin tensed protectively.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Be at ease," Kathrin said softly. "I don't want to harm her."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin watched as Kathrin's fingers moved over Lorna's pulse points. The Radi-Mon's dark, pupilless eyes seemed to look beyond the physical.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "She has been suffering," Kathrin spoke quietly. "Her sleep for the past three days has been disturbed by nightmares. No doubt the Fenris Nucleus Virus in her system is doing its work." As if responding, patches of Lorna's skin along her shoulders flickered with faint blue light, pulsing briefly before fading.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Is there no way to stop those?" Xin frowned as he looked at Kathrin.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The mentally strong eventually develop resistance to it." Kathrin paused, her hand on Lorna's forehead. "But for many, the Fenris strain plagues them daily and drives them toward insanity."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "How do you develop this resistance?" Xin asked.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "By accepting your transformation, and finding comfort in a lover's embrace." Kathrin's response was mysterious, her eyes meeting Xin's as she offered a hollow smile. "I sense there's more you want to ask me?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin hesitated, his fingers unconsciously tracing patterns on Lorna's arm. Beneath his touch, her ivory skin responded with gentle waves of blue light, showing the turmoil even in her unconscious state.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Moondust Crystal," he blurted out. "What do you know about it? Anything…" He trailed off.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kathrin was silent for a long moment. The air grew thick with tension, and Xin found himself holding his breath. Emmanuel and Tanha approached, standing beside them.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I know one thing for certain," Kathrin finally said, her voice low and careful. "The amulet Lorna wears – the Pendant of Mánagrát — is a part of the Crystal."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin's eyes narrowed. "What do you mean, 'part of it'?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kathrin's tentacles moved slowly, showing some inner agitation. "The blue jewel in the pendant's center was carved from a fragment of Moondust itself. Whoever made it had a reason to break the artifact into pieces, keeping it incomplete until the right moment."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin's mind raced, connecting bits of information and half-remembered conversations. But he could think no further.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "So that's why Primarch Moro…" Xin whispered, his voice trailing off as the revelation sank in.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kathrin nodded solemnly. "Indeed. The inspection was no mere formality."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin looked down at Lorna's face, peaceful in unconsciousness. The skin at her throat, where the pendant usually rested, throbbed with a soft blue glow that came and went like a distant lighthouse's beam.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   What would happen when she woke?
  </span>
 </p>
