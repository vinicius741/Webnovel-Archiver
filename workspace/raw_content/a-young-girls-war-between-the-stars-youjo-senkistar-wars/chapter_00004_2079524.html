<p class="cnM5ZGIxMzI1MjQ3NjRlZGM5YzUxYjk5ODBhMzFlMzA1" style="margin-bottom: 0">Taking out my tablet, I connected to the local network and began working to pass the time. I started with a search of the Jedi and who I was likely dealing with. That took some time, because the Jedi were apparently pretty secretive and didn’t like to advertise. There were accounts, however. News articles. They couldn’t hide everything, and a bit of digging had me a group of names and faces to go along with them. Of those, I narrowed it down to who I suspected I would actually need to convince.</p>

<p class="cnNkZjc0MWY0MGE5ZjQ4Nzc5M2UzYjE4YTljM2RlZTZm" style="margin-bottom: 0">Grand Master Yoda was at the top of the list. Tiny. Green. Old. Not human, but humanoid. ‘Enigmatic’ or ‘cryptic’ according to interviews of those who had worked with him.</p>

<p class="cnM3ZmVjNWM4YmNiNjQ5YzA4ZmE3Y2FlOWZlYTk2NmI4" style="margin-bottom: 0">Master Ki-Adi-Mundi was just below him. A member of a near-human species. His head… looked like a penis, if I’m being honest. He was regarded as intelligent, wise, possessed of ‘noble thinking,’ logical, and stoic. Reading between the lines and listening to the man’s own words, he was full of himself, quick to leap to a conclusion, and stubborn once he made up his mind about something. The sort to make a grave error, then later act as though he had no hand in it. From everything I saw, I knew his type well. He was a middle manager who had ascended to the level of his incompetence as upper management, given more power and authority than he deserved, and it had only further over inflated his sense of self worth.</p>

<p class="cnNiZGUzNzUxMzY4NTQyYWY4ZTZmODczYzlhYWM4ZjQ0" style="margin-bottom: 0">It was still a mystery how this galaxy, which had never heard of Earth, had Earth human phenotypes that had taken hundreds of thousands of years of divergent evolution to develop spread across it. It honestly left me wondering if there might be a grain of truth to the stories of those people accused of wearing tinfoil hats and claiming to have been probed, or abducted. Regardless of the mystery, as curious as it was, it mattered little overall and less at the moment.</p>
<p class="cnNjNDIzZjFjYTIxNzRkZjg4NTRkMzdjY2Y3NDkxNWIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM5ZWQ0NWYyNTJmOTRhY2I4MmJmZWE3MzIyODk5OGM2" style="margin-bottom: 0">Windu was… a curious case. On the one hand, everything I read, all of the holovid and audio clips, painted the man as an asshole if I’m being blunt. On the other hand, the things he said, his opinions on certain topics regarding corruption, civil unrest within the Republic, the Senate and their relationship with the order—they were either similar to conclusions I had come to already, or sounded like I would agree with them with more information on the subject. He seemed like a very <em>by the book</em><span style="font-style: normal"> kind of person. A traditionalist within a very</span><em> traditional</em><span style="font-style: normal"> order.</span><em> </em><span style="font-style: normal">Digging deeper however, the man was a bit of a contradiction—as the traditionalist had developed his own lightsaber style, of which not much was known to the public, save for a few recordings of him in combat. Watching those compared to other recorded instances of Jedi lightsaber combat, I could only conclude that it was much more aggressive, unpredictable, and ferocious. Savage, really.</span></p>

Twelve in total, from what I could gather. </span><span style="font-style: normal">Of those, </span><span style="font-style: normal">few were as pivotal in making decisions as those three and Dooku himself—and most of them could be considered to fall into faction lines behind one of the primary three on my list.

<p class="cnM5MTM5NzkzYjI5NzRlMDdiZDkwZjBjN2M5ZDQxZTYx" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">Master Dooku appeared to be generally aligned with Grand Master Yoda and Master Windu. Sifo-Dyas was another human male whose views I found to align him mostly in Windu’s faction. Coleman Trebor, Saesee Tinn, and Plo Koon all tended to align with either Mundi or Yoda.</p>

I didn’t see much of a point doing more research on the council. Dooku had already been in there over an hour, so at a guess, they weren’t <em>just</em><span style="font-style: normal"> here to discuss his visit to Zeltros and taking me on as a student.

<p class="cnM4NzU1ZWQ3ZmYyMzQyZmVhMWM1OWMzN2E0Zjc2M2Uy" style="margin-bottom: 0">There were looks and a few murmurs, before eventually the green grandmaster cut in. “Allow it, we shall. Deliberate, this council must. Please wait outside.”</p>
<p class="cnMxZGRkZDhlZWM2ODQ5OTNiYWM1MWZkNjE4ZmFhMzIw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM4ZTA5MjgzNTlmODQyYTBiNzc4ZGE4NmUyNzMwZDg2" style="margin-bottom: 0">I nodded and turned for the elevator, only for Dooku to speak up. “Master Yoda, if I may?”</p>
<p class="cnNlNDhiOTIxMjA4ZjRlZTRhMWVkYzgxNjEwNDExNmVj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNiYWMzYzU0NGIwNzQ2OWFhMGZiYWQ4M2VjNmYyODQ3" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Hoh? Something to say, have you?” the old alien radiated amusement for some reason. “Very well.”</p>
<p class="cnM1NjExMzVjYWQ3YjQ2ODNhMzI0YjI3Y2NlYTc5ZTEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNlNWZhZDAxMDVjYTRmZThhOGM2NjIwZGNiMTI5OTI2" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Not I,” Dooku chuckled. “No, it’s best to hear it from her own lips.” Turning a look on me, he nodded. “Tell the council what you told me.”</p>
<p class="cnNkZGNlMzhkOGIzMTRiNDg4ZmFhYTY2MWQ5YTdmZWNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMwMDIwYzU1MzA4MTQwYzNhOWEzZWVjNDhmYWUzMzNh" style="margin-bottom: 0">Nodding, I pulled my tablet from my pocket. “I’ve updated a few things and revised some estimates since we landed, thanks to the lack of lag on interstellar data requests. Some things have also advanced,” I murmured, shaking my head. Looking up, I swept my gaze over the eyes of the three men who had proved to be mostly in charge. Then, I gave the same report I had given twice now, with the most recent updates—updates which moved the timetable up and expanded the scale of the coming conflict, and more thoroughly and clearly outlined the IBC’s involvement and their goals.</p>
<p class="cnM3NWM0ZDIyM2RhMzQzZjg5ZDc0NmY1NGU3MDhhZjQx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMxYjY5YzQ2OTY5YTRmNDdhNzE3MzA3ZmVkOGJlZDdm" style="margin-bottom: 0">As I spoke, I watched them, listening to their emotions while keeping my own sealed inside behind a one-way wall while I filtered out everything from beyond the room—a little trick I didn’t intend to let them know I was capable of. At first, I was met with skepticism and amusement in equal parts from different members of the council. Only a few people actually took interest at first. Dooku, of course. Yoda, as he eyed me with a focus that would have unnerved me if I were an actual child. And, strangely enough, Dyas for some reason—the man practically perked up and sat on the edge of his seat.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZWYwYWIxYWQ1OTRmZmJiOGI5OWJmNTkxZDY0MjNh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM3MzkzMmU5MjYxMzQzNGZiMTQ3NWM1OWExMzFmMWQ3" style="margin-bottom: 0">Then, I got to the meat of the report. The amusement dropped away immediately. People like Windu actually started taking it seriously. A wave of alarm rippled through the council, though skeptics remained—like Mundi. That is, until I decided to handle him personally.</p>
<p class="cnMwNDE0ZDFjODQ2ZTRmNjI5OWEyMTczM2Y1MDY2OTMw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMwYzg5MDk1YTU1ZTQ5NGU5YjEzZmY0MmI4M2Q3ZDgw" style="margin-bottom: 0">Walking up, I handed him the tablet. “These are the most up to date charts and graphs, along with the intergalactic stock market graph for the last hundred years, with the period of time where these troubles began highlighted.”</p>
<p class="cnM5ZTAzN2EyMzMyODQ2OWZhY2MxM2JkYjFkZWJkYTgw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNjY2M3YmQ0ZjRhYTQwNDJhYzNmNDJmMWIyY2I4MGMz" style="margin-bottom: 0">Mundi looked it over and, as he did, I felt his skepticism fade. Slowly, the man nodded as a frown worked its way onto his face. Eventually, he passed it to Yoda and the tablet began to make its way around the group.</p>
<p class="cnM0OGQ3ZjM5ZWQ4ZjQyYjc4OWI5NzAyYWVmMjE5Nzhk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNhNGEzYmFiMzE4MDRkMzg5ZTQ4ODE0NDAzYjU2ZDQ1" style="margin-bottom: 0">“In conclusion, masters,” I returned to the center of the circle, “the banking clan is preparing for a war. Not today or tomorrow, but ten years from now—with a margin of error of two years to either side, though most likely on the side of waiting and building their forces a bit more.”</p>
<p class="cnNjN2JmYzllMzVmZDRjNDVhMmNkZmRlNzUwYmE5YmM2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM5MzIzYzMwYjlmYTQ2ZGE5OTQ5NTViZGY0ODNiODIy" style="margin-bottom: 0">The three Jedi I was focusing on exchanged looks, before Windu gestured towards the elevator. “You said you were hungry. The cafeteria should be serving dinner about now. Take the elevator down and help yourself.”</p>
<p class="cnM3YzFmZjNhYWYyMjRjYmNhMGY5ZGFhNzU0MjE4ODAw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMyYzZhYTdiNjUzMzRlOWI5NDg3Y2VhZWMzMWNmNjk3" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Where—” I began to ask, and the man’s lips quirked up into an amused smile. “Use the Force to find it. Understood.” I glanced at Dooku and added, “I’ll return to the waiting room when I finish.”</p>
<p class="cnM2Y2FjYjIwZTI4MjRkZjM5NzRiYmI2Y2YxZWJhNjc4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM0NDkyYzgwM2UzODQ5NWRhZjU4N2NlOWM0NzFiZjU5" style="margin-bottom: 0">With that, I made my way to the elevator.</p>
<hr/>
<p class="cnM4YTRmZjVkYTMzMTRhYjRhOTI4YmFiYjE2ZGQ4OGVj" style="margin-bottom: 0">Dooku sat back and crossed his arms, stifling his smile as the council erupted the moment the girl left. Nearby, Yoda watched him, meeting his eyes with a knowing look. After a few minutes of pandemonium and arguing, the old grandmaster clacked his walking stick on the floor twice. The room fell silent.</p>
<p class="cnNhODk2MjYyMzljNDQwOWQ5N2ZiZmRiN2I0MmYyYTlh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM5YjQ0YjczNTUyODQ2OTdhZmYwNWQxMjA3MTdiYjEz" style="margin-bottom: 2em">“Right you were, to bring her before us,” Yoda nodded.“As I said, I have reason to believe the Force itself brought her to me,” Dooku reiterated what he had said in their earlier meeting. “This is where she belongs.”</p>
<p class="cnNiYmY0NjFlNzJiZDQ2ZDdiZjE1MzAzNTUyMjE1NTcy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMyMTRkYWI4NjgyNzQ3ZGVhMzYwMmUwOThmNTY2MjA5" style="margin-bottom: 0">“We don’t have time for this now. We need to act on this information <em>immediately</em>—” Windu began, only for Dooku to interrupt.</p>
<p class="cnMxYzU5NDFiNmE3ZTQxZWU5MzczMmU2OGE4ZGE5YzE4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMyZjRiYzZjZjljOTRiOThhZGRiY2EzZjYwYjE2Nzgw" style="margin-bottom: 0">“We have plenty of time. Eight to twelve years worth of time,” the older man’s tone was firm. “What is an extra hour to decide the fate of the one who brought us this warning going to cost us, when as we all well know that it’s past the end of the business day and many of those whom we would contact about this matter will not pick up outside of those hours, even for us? No. Best to decide now, then begin discussions as to how best to handle it.”</p>
<p class="cnNmNjMyYmI3MGVlNTQ0OTQ4ZDkwN2I3ZmIxODc3Nzk1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM0ZjJkNzc2M2U3NDQwMWE4NDZhNGU1MDY4OTA4ZmU2" style="margin-bottom: 0">Windu and several others all clamored to speak at the same time, only for another clack of Yoda’s staff on the floor to silence them. “Correct, Dooku is. Time, we have. A decision must be made. Put it to a vote, we shall. Master Mundi?”</p>
<p class="cnM0MGU5MDJlZTVjMDQzNjE5ZmUyN2Q0ZDNmY2YzMDcw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM0MjYzMDIyNGRhOTRjYTdhZTg4MzYwMmEzMTI0OGRj" style="margin-bottom: 0">The Cerean reached up and stroked his beard. “I don’t like that her mind is hidden from us,” he frowned. “That being said, her work stands for itself. It’s thorough. Meticulous. She spent the time waiting researching <em>us</em><span style="font-style: normal"> and further fleshing out the information she gathered. We could use a mind like that.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZjg1NTk3ZWIzNjRlYmNhN2MwMDExMDQ1YzViMzM4" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM2YzZlMDIyMzhkNzRhMDU5NDFhZTdmYzkwOWY1NTNj" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">Yoda turned and looked to Windu. The human considered for a moment. “She’s stubborn. I suspect we’re going to have another Qui-Gon Jinn on our hands.”</p>
<p class="cnM3Njg2YmZiMzM2MDRhZDFiZmQ5Y2EwNDE3MGNhZTdh" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNiM2JjODgyNDBmZTRlNTg4MTliM2YzODEwMDhiMTU4" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<span style="font-style: normal">Need that, </span><em>we do not</em><span style="font-style: normal">,” Yoda murmured.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMjY2Mzg2YmIwNTQ3YjdhYjVkZmVmZGI2NGYzNTky" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM1MzZjYzQ3Njc5MzQxZjM5NDI3ZDM3MTU0NjFhODVm" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<span style="font-style: normal">Perhaps not in the same way. I get the feeling she’ll follow the </span><em>letter</em><span style="font-style: normal"> of any order she disagrees with, or find ways to creatively misinterpret them,” Windu continued. “You saw it in the way she answere</span><span style="font-style: normal">d.” </span><span style="font-style: normal">Steepling his fingers, his gaze shifted between Yoda and Dooku as he thought. Finally, he nodded. “As Mundi said, she could be useful in any sort of intelligence gathering, research, or analytical role. However, as master Dyas pointed out, she is a natural empath due to being a Zeltron, and more sensitive to that sort of thing than your average Jedi. Yes, she shields her mind, and while that </span><span style="font-style: normal">unknown</span><span style="font-style: normal"> is somewhat worrying, </span><span style="font-style: normal">we can determine her intent through her actions—which, so far, have been to pass what she knew along to us. Be that through her own design or the will of the Force.</span><span style="font-style: normal"> </span><span style="font-style: normal">I</span><span style="font-style: normal">t </span><span style="font-style: normal">also </span><span style="font-style: normal">seems to allow her greater control over her emotions than </span><span style="font-style: normal">some who have attained the rank of master themselves. She’s intelligent, mature, driven, and aware of the Force. She’ll find a way to train herself if we don’t. Better we take her in where we can keep an eye on her and influence her training and education, than leaving her to her own devices, perhaps to come back and bite us later. </span><span style="font-style: normal">I say</span><span style="font-style: normal"> </span><span style="font-style: normal">fast track her for a role as a Consular.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOWFhZDg4ZDBmOTRiYmRiMjRjY2VhZjViMzZjMGNj" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNlOWRjZjIwMDY4MzRhZmZhNzdiYzZkZTJmNTRjYzI3" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<span style="font-style: normal">There is </span><span style="font-style: normal">a </span><span style="font-style: normal">darkness within her. Far more than would be acceptable for an adult Jedi, let alone a child, </span><span style="font-style: normal">and we cannot account for it.

<p class="cnNjMjY0ODg0NzNjYTQxNjZiYmM0YTRjYzMyNjI0YmIx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM3YzRlNWM2NDUyYTQ2OGNiZjU1YmIzZWJmYTA5YmUw" style="margin-bottom: 0">And so it went, as opinions were voiced around the circle as Dooku watched and listened, and made note of who leaned which way and their reasons for doing so. The vote was close—too close for his liking. The more pragmatic minds wanted to bring her in, either to use her or as Windu had said, to tie down a potential loose cannon. Unfortunately, several of their number were entirely against the idea, for one reason or another—the black box that was the girl’s mind, her rebellious streak, or more likely as he suspected it was the very same thing about her that had him fighting off the reflex to reach for his lightsaber from time to time.</p>
<p class="cnNkYTQ3YWZmMWVhZjRiOGU4OWE4M2U4ZDhiMjAzYTI1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM4ZTgyNjNmNzQ1ZDQ3MzRhMGZlZDM4YTVkZGFhYjgz" style="margin-bottom: 0">Finally, the discussion came back to his own former master, Yoda. The old alien hummed for a moment before nodding. “Decided by majority, it is. Train her, we will not.”</p>
<p class="cnNiY2NiYTNmOWY4ODQ5ZWZhZmQwZTc5YzNlMjQ2Yjgx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMxOTAxZTgwYTg4ODQ0N2JhOTYzZWEzNTRiNWU3NTk3" style="margin-bottom: 0">Dooku nodded and stood. “Very well. Thank you for your time, councilors. Then effective immediately, I hereby tender my resignation from this council and the Jedi order.” The room erupted into noise and Dooku raised his voice. “I will take young Tanya with me and train her myself, to make sure that she doesn’t fall into the wrong hands. We wouldn’t want the banking clan getting their hands on her. Or the Hutts.”</p>
<p class="cnM5Y2NkNDk4MDIyOTRhMTBiMGE2MGY2NzU5NWJkZmFk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNjNDA2ZTM5NDFlMjQ1Mzg4MTM4ZjQ2Y2I3YWE0ZjUx" style="margin-bottom: 0">That silenced the chamber. Leaning forward, Mundi asked, “You would leave the order over one girl? Why?”</p>
<p class="cnNjZTdlYWU5NmUzYjQ0NmY4ZTZiZjZkNGIzNTRmMTY2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNjM2JhNWEzMzgzMTQ2YTBhYTg2ZWU5ODEyNjk2ZGFl" style="margin-bottom: 0">“…Is it the prophecy?” Windu asked, drawing the eyes of the room to himself.</p>
<p class="cnMzY2JiM2MxMjk3MzQwODc5MmMwZjA4Y2U2YzA4OTE1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM3MzdkNzUxMzQ3MDRlYjI4MDY1ZmYxMTcwMWFkZjYx" style="margin-bottom: 0">“I can’t be certain,” Dooku shook his head. “She fits several of the criteria. Strong in the Force. As some have argued, there is a darkness within her, but where you see darkness I see a <em>balance</em> of the Force.” Meeting Windu’s eyes, he continued, “And as you especially well know, an inner darkness does not necessarily mean evil.”</p>
<p class="cnMzMTVhYmM3YzE5ZjQ0NjJhMmQxOTY2MDI0OTg3ZTQ0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNiNzFlNWU3Y2E2YzQwMzg4ZmExNGYwMzBlOGYyNGM5" style="margin-bottom: 0">“You can’t know that for certain,” Windu argued, and Dooku nodded.</p>
<p class="cnMwYzZhMzA0ZmE3OTRlYTY4ZDU3YWIzMWE1N2VmNDZj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM0YTQ2MjNjY2I4ZjQyOWM5MDNiOTc0ZGQ1OTA3YzVm" style="margin-bottom: 0">“That is true. I sense much fear in you, in this council.” Several of them looked upset at being called out, but he continued. “We can only trust in the Force. The only way to know for sure is with time, and allowing her to learn. Teach her to harness it in ways that aren’t destructive to herself and those around her. Or would you have me do nothing? Send her on her way and see where fate sends her? No. I can’t, in good conscience, allow that to happen.”</p>
<p class="cnM5ZGU2ZDg3YjIzMTQxMDhhNDdkOGFlMmZjNjVkNjI0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMwNDA1MWQ2YzE1ODQ4ODRhODAxMjVlNWZiOThkY2M2" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Much is shrouded about her future,” Yoda hummed. “But right you are, perhaps. Better we keep her close, than others with more nefarious goals we allow to claim her.” Looking towards those who had voted nay, he continued, “Urge you to reconsider, I do.”</p>
<p class="cnMxYjljYTgwZWY2NDQxNjNiNmExYzgyNDZmYTFmNmZh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM4ODE1MzYyYWE1YTQ5NTQ4YzYzYTA4NTg1NjY2ODA4" style="margin-bottom: 0">A moment later, one of the few women on the council, Jocasta Nu, sighed. “Perhaps Dooku is correct. For what is balance without the presence of opposing forces? I’ll change my vote. Bring her in. Send her to me. If she wishes to learn, there is a place for her in the library.”</p>
<p class="cnNiNTE2OGE1YmZkODQ1ZDRiMmY0MjhmYzIxMWUyZDg1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNiMWJlMmVkMzZlODRhZTg4Mjc5ZWMyNzViYTdhNDc4" style="margin-bottom: 0">Nodding, Yoda tapped his cane on the ground. “Settled, the matter is. She will be taught. Reconvene tomorrow, we shall, to speak of this news. Until then, tread carefully we must. Warn the banking clan and their allies, we must not. Meditate upon this, I will. Recommend you do the same.”</p>
<p class="cnMwYzMzY2IxMjI4YzQzNjE5YzYyMWJmOTQzZmI1NzIw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM2YWY4MGEyZDhiNzQyNTVhOTdhNmMyZGEyZmEzNjdm" style="margin-bottom: 0">With that, the old master stood and started for the elevator, the meeting over. Dooku stood and joined him as others began breaking off into groups to talk. Windu followed and, as the elevator was about to close, Dyas squeezed in.</p>
<p class="cnMzZjFhNjk2MTFjZTRkODVhNDUyYmM4MGY2NjRjZjlh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM5MjE1OTA4NWMzMzQyMjRiYzM3OTUxNDM3YmJjMWYw" style="margin-bottom: 0">The younger man grinned as the elevator began to descend the tower. “I’d like to speak with her more, once she’s settled in.”</p>
<p class="cnNhNjQyYTQzNDQ5ZTRjOTM5YjNlMzVkMTFmMTY3ODFm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM1ZTA1ZjczMzkzNjQxNmI4MWUyNzdjN2Y0M2ExYTU1" style="margin-bottom: 0">Humming, Yoda turned a look up at him. “A vision of the future, you have had?”</p>
<p class="cnM0YTYyNWYwNzA4MDQzNGRiYTI5ODk3ZmE2ZjI1NDFl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMxOWEwZmNjMGRhMjQ1ZTE4MGQzYmZjNWM5YzFlNGFj" style="margin-bottom: 0">Dyas nodded. “Last night, in fact. I foresaw a war. Not with whom specifically, or when exactly, but a war. Lots of droids. Lots of human troops. And a great many Jedi casualties.”</p>
<p class="cnM4OWJjNWUxNGZhNjQ1MTNiMGJkYWFmMDNmYjQ1NTZi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMwZTJjMGFiMGFhZTQ1NjdiNDY0N2UyMDcwYjVmZjRl" style="margin-bottom: 0">“And you think this is related to the girl?” Windu asked, and Dyas nodded.</p>
<p class="cnNkOWQ2ZmYyNThiOTRiZTU5YTdkNGZkNzE3YTllMWNl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM4NDVhNjU4Y2QzMTQxOTFiY2FhMzQ0NDg3MTdmZDky" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Absolutely. The droids, weapons, and ships in her report were the ones from my vision. Without a doubt.” A determined look crossed his face. “If master Dooku is too busy or changes his mind, I’ll take her on as an apprentice myself, in a few years.”</p>
<p class="cnMxM2M5YTEzY2ZlZDQ4NDI4ZjQyMWQ2NmJlM2Y5YTFl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNkMzc4YTMxN2M3MzQyNzFhZTZkOWIzMWJhZDQyMjEw" style="margin-bottom: 0">Dooku chuckled. “I doubt you’ll get the chance.”</p>
<p class="cnM5NDIxZDNmZDExMjQ4MDg5YTViMjUxODYyZDNlMTBk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMzZTBmNTM3MTc3MjRiYjNiNzQxOTdkYmY5NDRlOTQx" style="margin-bottom: 0">“What have you done?” Yoda asked, narrowing his eyes at his former apprentice.</p>
<p class="cnNiMzg2MDU1ZDYwYjQ2YjA5OThiZDczMDY1ODc0YzUx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMwZDUxNTc5NDA2ODQ2YTA5ODNlNzgwZGRjOWNjMzc4" style="margin-bottom: 0">The human smiled. “Nothing much. I just gave her some preliminary training, to pass the time on the journey here from Zeltros. I set her against a pair of training drones.”</p>
<p class="cnM1OGRmZTk2MDYzNjQwNTNiNjgxNjBjMjQ0OWMwZTI3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNlZWI2YTU0MDJhMjQyYmRiNTJjMmZiZjFiMGU2OTgw" style="margin-bottom: 0">Curious, Windu asked, “How did she do?”</p>
<p class="cnMyZjg3ODdkZGYzYjRhMzY5NGFjNTFmMjNhNGJjZDNl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMyMjQ0NGYzMzBhZTRmOTE4NDRmMTY2ZjUwMjg2ZWYz" style="margin-bottom: 0">“I think I’ll let you see that for yourselves. Seeing is believing, after all. I will say that her dedication is remarkable. She has that rare combination of being a natural talent and the sort of work ethic to take advantage of it. She spent no less than twelve hours a day with the drones, broken up by time spent studying flight manuals so she could better understand what the Force was guiding her to do when I had her fly the ship.”</p>
<p class="cnM4Y2IyNjZiM2EwMTRjODlhOWMxMjIwOTk1ZWUwOWY0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMxYzM5MmMxNDhjYjRjYzBhZmViNjVlY2IwZGE3Nzlj" style="margin-bottom: 0">“That’s insane,” Dyas muttered. “She’s, what? Six? Seven?”</p>
<p class="cnMyOTI2ZmI4YmUzMjQ0ZWE4MzE0ZmRlZDA0NThhZDcy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNjNDZlM2Y1NDNjNDQzODFhNmU1NDRmMjY0ZjdiNzJl" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Six,” Dooku confirmed.</p>

<p class="cnM0MWM0OTM4ZTM3MDQ5YWNiMDFlM2NmZmFiY2FmNmUx" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Not normal. Are you thinking she’ll blow through the usual training?”</p>
<p class="cnNlNWU2NWU4YWNkYTRmNWViODI2ZGU3YTM2ZDAxZTZi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNkZDU3ODMxN2Y0MzQyYWI5NGM1Y2NiZDZhYjZjN2Zk" style="margin-bottom: 0">“I believe she will complete it exactly as instructed,” Dooku shook his head, then smiled and added, “And then find other ways to occupy herself.”</p>

<p class="cnM2OTQwNjU5OTFiYTQ1MDdiZGNmYTBlMDJlZjdiMTVl" style="margin-bottom: 0">“In that case, I’ll get her settled into quarters.” Starting for the cafeteria, Dooku paused, “I believe it would be best to keep her separate from the other younglings. Give her a room to herself, as we do for older padawans. When I spoke with the matron of the orphanage where she had been living, that was how things were arranged for everyone’s mutual comfort.”</p>

<p class="cnMzYzhmMDE2MmJlOTRkMWE5ZmFhYmZmYTRhMzNkN2Fk" style="margin-bottom: 0">Dyas chuckled. “Sure. Let’s<em> not</em><span style="font-style: normal"> take her race and circumstances into consideration.</span><em> </em>While you’re at it, why don’t you go tell those Jedi we’re making the exceptions on marriage for that they’re no longer allowed?”</p>

<p class="cnM3OTQ1ZTY2ZTdkYzQ4NDViNzgwNjMxM2YzNDZmMDM0" style="margin-bottom: 0">Windu frowned but said nothing. It was well known that he didn’t like there being <em>any</em><span style="font-style: normal"> exceptions, special consideration, or anything that remotely looked like favoritism among their ranks. Yoda cut off the argument with a nod. “Do as you must.”</span></p>

<p class="cnM3ZjkyNjA1NDIyZTQyZjg4NDFhODgzMmVmMDQ2YWYz" style="margin-bottom: 0">With that, they went their separate ways. Dooku found the cafeteria only a few minutes later. Looking over it, he raised an eyebrow at what he found.</p>

<p class="cnNlMDBiMmE4YWE5ZDQ2ZjlhNzA2ZDlkMmRkZjhiMjMw" style="margin-bottom: 0">The cafeteria was like any number of cafeterias I had been in across two lifetimes. The line was long and slower than it needed to be. The atmosphere was chaotic and noisy. The whole place was divided up into groups and cliques that I didn’t understand beyond being able to separate them by age and sometimes race, as some species tended to group together.</p>

<p class="cnNjOGVhNjA5Mjk2MzQ5NDY5YmJlYTc4ZDkyNDMwNjIy" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">As the only one not wearing robes, I stood out. Between the Force and my empathic sense, I could literally feel every set of eyes watching me and the air of curiosity filling the room. There was also something else.</p>
<p class="cnNhOTAxZWM0MmQyZjRiY2FhZjBhOGY5ZDRlNWE2Mjdm" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNhNmJlMWZkOTQ3YjQwOGVhYTliMTEzNGRkODM2MDY3" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">Glancing around, I spotted the tables on the far end, where older padawans were sitting. A few of them were looking my way and smiling, occasionally joking with their friends. Given the feelings of amusement and arousal—the second thankfully not specifically directed at me—it wasn’t hard to guess what they were talking about.</p>

<p class="cnNmMzE3ZGRmYzIzMzQwNzk5M2MyYmI5ODcyMmZkOGM3" style="margin-bottom: 0">Shaking my head, I made my way to an empty table and took a seat. Taking up the two-pronged fork, I began to methodically destroy my meal. The meat tasted like beef with the consistency of veal and the sauce turned out to be something tangy and a bit spicy. The fruits and vegetables were all a new experience, but good—save for some bits of something the Force warned me off of and I shoved to the side of my plate. The drink tasted like nothing I’d ever had before—sweet and light, and left me wanting more.</p>

<p class="cnM2MzdjNDNlNmRjZTRjODk4NjZkZTM3ODlhYTk4YjEz" style="margin-bottom: 0">I looked up as someone put a plate down across from me and plopped down in the seat. It was a human girl of perhaps thirteen or fourteen, with light brown hair, blue-gray eyes, and wearing the same robes as everyone else—save that she had a brown over-robe on. There was a lightsaber similar to the ones I’d seen Dooku and the council members wearing attached to her side. That and the over-robe told me she was probably not a student here, but actually some Jedi master’s apprentice.</p>

<p class="cnMxNTRhYzNhZTZmYjQ4Y2NiNGY4NWE0OGI1ZTVmNThi" style="margin-bottom: 0">She radiated curiosity, amusement, and patience as she waited, starting to eat her own meal that looked and smelled like chicken and salad. Finally, I nodded. “Tanya,” I introduced myself, holding out my hand.</p>

<p class="cnNiYzdhMTk2MWNjYzQ2MjZhOGQxYjkyNTBkMmQzZjJl" style="margin-bottom: 0">I let out a disgusted sigh. At the same time, her emotions shifted to teasing and more amusement, even as her eyes slid towards the older students at the end of the hall.</p>

<p class="cnMxY2ZiMGI1MGFkMzRlNGQ4ZDhiN2FhYTNhZjI3ZTQx" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Of course!” she agreed, and I listened intently as she went on to describe the individual parts that went into creating a lightsaber and the entire process of using the Force to put them together.</p>
