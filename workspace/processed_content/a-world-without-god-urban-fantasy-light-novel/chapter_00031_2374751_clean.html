   One of the women’s consciousness slowly came back. She stood up and looked around herself to get her bearings. The place was familiar to her, and yet it seemed somewhat foreign.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The woman was on a stone path, surrounded by water on both sides. She couldn’t see the sun behind the tall trees surrounding the Shrine. However, unlike the previous pitch-black darkness, the diffuse light scattered in the bright blue sky was more than enough to see clearly. The air felt cool, but not cold, with a certain dampness to it. In the background, a low rumbling sound caught her attention. When she turned around, she saw the distant waterfalls surrounding the Shrine.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She breathed a sigh of relief. The Upper Realm was back to normal, just like Ayumi said it would.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Only then did she notice she wasn’t alone. Lying against the stone steps was another woman she had met just a few hours prior. Shiina slept peacefully, and there were no signs she was about to wake up anytime soon.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “She really stays asleep for a long time after fainting, doesn’t she?” Hikari uttered, but naturally received no response.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   After confirming the Upper Realm seemed to be back to normal, her attention immediately turned to herself. After all, according to Ayumi, she was now an archangel, with access to responsibilities that she never once thought she would ever have. Yet, she didn’t feel any different from usual. She ran a test on herself, but her powers weren’t magically improved in the slightest.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Now, what to do?...”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    could
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   wake Shiina up, but she thought better of it. This was Hikari’s first opportunity to spend some time alone after everything that happened, and she wanted to relish it. Who knew when she would get another chance like this.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <span>
    She can stay asleep for a little while longer.
   </span>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   After thinking about it for a while, there was just one thing she wanted to do—no, that she
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    must
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   do, now that she was an archangel.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She approached the Shrine, which had its doors closed, and reached out her palms to push on the door. But then, nothing happened. For a moment, Hikari thought that the doors were locked. But then she realized that no—she just wasn’t putting any force into it. In fact, her arms were trembling.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Ah-ah. Well, well, now
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    this
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   is a surprise.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She was hesitating. When Shiina had refused to enter the Shrine before, Hikari’s first reaction was to mentally admonished her. After all, it was more than obvious that their entire belief system was a sham. This shrine had no special meaning at all; all it served was an entrance to the Controller, and a convenient focal point for the fake religion of the angels. Hikari knew all this, and she believed the destruction of her convictions had permeated to her core. But apparently, she was wrong. Even she, a heretic if there ever was one, felt some unconscious force preventing her from moving.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Now I’m glad I didn’t wake Shiina up… What a terrible sight this would be.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Hikari shook her head in disbelief. Clearly, things weren’t all resolved within her heart. But she had to move forward. And the first step was to open these damn doors. She breathed in, exhaled, and with way more strength than necessary, flung the doors open.

  <span>
   Unlike before, when Takeya visited, the Shrine was illuminated with the vestige of sunlight that streamed through the high frosted windows, giving it an almost mystical feeling.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <span>
    What a pretty place...
   </span>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The only thing of note in the entire room was an altar at the far back, with indentations for kneeling.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “So this is the infamous altar. Let’s see here…”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Hikari, still looking like the high-school girl Kotori, kneeled down on the stone floor. Despite wearing tights, she could still feel the cold from the stone reaching her skin. She closed her eyes and instinctively assumed the praying position drilled into her after decades of service.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   It didn’t take long for her mind to automatically get into a zen-like state. She barely took notice that was the first time she prayed after knowing the truth. Part of her felt just as connected with God as always, but another part knew all this was just the system reinforcing her beliefs. These two feelings twisted and clashed inside her, not quite meshing together, but not separating either.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   But she didn’t have time to sort out her feelings, as a voice echoed in her mind, not unlike when angels telepathically communicated with each other.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <span>
    «You, who wishes to see our most sacred treasure, answer this question from the bottom of your heart. What is the most important thing in the world?»
   </span>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The angel smirked. Every fiber of her being knew that not a single angel would answer anything other than “God”. But she knew the right answer. It wasn’t a question about herself, or even angels in general, but rather, an answer set up by the creators of this world. A single word, the name of a girl who was no longer a part of the world, but would forever be linked to it.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Ayumi.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As expected, a low rumble shook the ground. When she opened her eyes, a spiral staircase was in front of her. A gaping maw leading into the depths of the Upper Realm. Hikari didn’t waste any time climbing down the stairs. The sunlight gradually gave way to a mechanical, unnatural blue light. And, at the end of the stairs, she arrived in the secret room holding the “most sacred treasure”.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   And she grinned.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Ah-ah. Guess there’s no pretending now…” She said as she leaned on the wall with blinking lights and unknown machinery.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   There was no mistaking the paragon of modern society standing right in front of her—a computer. She approached it with some care, caressing the table like it was something precious.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   After she felt ready, Hikari sat on the chair in front of the table with the curved monitor, a keyboard, and a mouse. Immediately, the monitor lit up. To her surprise, everything was written in
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    jolasin
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   , the language of the angels.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “How did he figure out how this thing worked if he couldn’t read anything?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   To the left and right, some graphs showed the real-time performance of Gaia in terms of memory usage, the number of humans and angels, and other sorts of information. However, the dizzying array of colors was more than the archangel could take. Not that they were particularly technical or complicated to grasp. No, it was something much simpler.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “This is going to be hard on my own.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Like most angels, Hikari wasn’t particularly well-versed with technology. However, her case was even more acute than most. To be blunt, she just couldn’t get the darn things. Of course, living in the modern world, pretending to be a high school girl, was impossible without some relation with technology—but she avoided the things like the plague. Even using a flip phone was stretching her abilities.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Even all that aside, she had a feeling this was a lot to take in for anyone. She mentally decided that this wasn’t a priority, leaving these investigations for another day.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   For now, she had something else to take care of.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “I love being Kotori, but for what’s to come, I have to be myself.” Then, she cracked a smile. “I wonder what she’ll think.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   And with that comment to herself, she began her transformation back to “herself”, in a place where no one could see her do it.
  </span>
