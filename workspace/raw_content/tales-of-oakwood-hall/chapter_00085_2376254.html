<p class="cnNmYjQ2MTk1MTFlMTQ3ODI5NjM2NzY3NDdlZmY2NDU4"><strong> </strong></p>
<p class="cnNlMmQ2Nzc5ZWFmOTRiOGI4ZTExYmRjMTk1OGI0ZmMz">Gabriel O'Connell, Senior Field Agent for the United Nations Supernatural Defense Initiative, loved teaching. He probably loved teaching more than any other part of his job. It was, after all, what he'd done for a living after he'd left the UNSDI in 1985, and before he'd been dragged back in 2004 to kick off the UNSDI's general purge and re-structuring.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZmY1ZDhhNjhhNTRlYTlhYmEwYTE3NmIzYmRkOGEw">Every year since his return, he'd happily volunteered to teach lore refresher courses to existing staff, to help train new hires, and more. He was, in fact, scheduled to teach one that very afternoon, on the various metaphysical side-effects of the time around Halloween and its repercussions on the real world.</p>
<p class="cnM4MjkwMDNlMzFhYjQxODZhNDVkODY3OGE4OWJlYWRl">It was, after all, one of their busiest times of the year at the UNSDI. The 30th and 31st of October, and the first of November - colloquially known as Devil's Night, Halloween, and All Hallows' Day - were almost always an exciting time for them.</p>
<p class="cnM2MzcyODIzMjVhMDQ1MzE4ZTE1YjExOWE4N2I5NzU3">This year, things had been uncommonly quiet so far...but it was a refreshing change of pace, and not something to worry about.</p>
<p class="cnNmYzE5YzUzOGFmMTRiMzI5YjVlMmMzZDY1NGM3NWQz">Gabriel thought that if he kept telling himself that, he might actually believe it.</p>
<p class="cnNiZmJmZjQ1NWNhMzQ1YjI5MWE2YmJkZmI2NTM0YjM3">Regardless, it wasn't at all uncommon to find Gabriel in the office he shared with his wife Mika - another Senior Field Agent - overlooking the impressive two-story UNSDI Operations Center, working on some class syllabus or other. The room beyond the broad windows of their office resembled a cross between a NASA operations room and the bridge of a starship, with huge screens hanging over rows of computer workstations and a central conference area with a long table.</p>
<p class="cnM1ODkzMTQyMjZlMjRiNWE5ZGMwNGIwOWU2MDU1YjBl">But their office - with their desks at either end and a cozy conversation area in the center - was insulated from the noise beyond and below. And Gabriel was entirely focused on his laptop computer, a stack of index cards, and a pile of hand-written notes.</p>
<p class="cnM3NDhlNmU2ZTJmMTQ5NDc4N2MzZDcyNmZjZGMxZWRj">Which might be why he jumped when his cell phone began to ring. Unfortunately, he'd left it on the coffee table in the center of the room, and the ringtone - the opening bars of Jeff Williams' <em>Red Like Roses</em> - told him it was his wife calling.</p>
<p class="cnMzYzg3NjA0MWViYjQ1Zjc4OThlMWFhYTVjNTNkMTMy">He dropped the fountain pen he was using, the nib leaving a splat of ink on one of the index cards, banged one of his knees on the bottom of his desk, and almost tipped his chair over backwards in his rush to push away from his desk...in spite of it being on wheels. He nearly tripped on one of the legs of his desk as he rounded it, vaulted the sofa between him and the coffee table, caught his foot on the edge of the sofa and almost planted his face on the coffee table.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZjlmMGJmNDcyNjRmNDY5NDJhN2U5OWUxMWMyMDll">As he was almost six and a half feet tall, the sight was undoubtedly rather comical.</p>
<p class="cnNjYjAwOTM3YmQ1ODQ4M2NhZmRiMTY5NTdhYmQ3Mjk0">He managed to break his fall with one hand, scooped up his phone with the other, rolled in mid-fall and landed on his back with his knees and feet up on the sofa. His brown hair was barely tousled, and if there was a hint of sheepishness in his gray eyes, it was heavily tempered with resignation. His wife, after all, would undoubtedly take exception with his well-worn black work boots being up on the sofa. If she found out.</p>
<p class="cnM1NjUyZDBjZDEwYTQ1NTM4OTQ4ODk4YzllOTRmMjU5">He swiped the answer button on his phone and then hit the speaker button. "Mika?" he asked breathlessly.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZTNlYTU5YzM5NzRkY2M5ZDE0ZTM1ZWMzZTkxZGQ1"><em>"I hope I'm not interrupting anything,"</em> Mika's husky contralto purred down the line to him, <em>"but I need you in Central Park. Now."</em></p>
<p class="cnM2ODJiZGU2MWJjYTRiNzRiMzEyYTg3NzcwYzU0NTE3">He groaned a little, rolled to his knees, and rose slowly. "Now, as in you need me to drive over, or now as in 'Drop what what you're doing and teleport directly to me because the shit's about to hit the fan?"</p>
<p class="cnM5MjQzYjIwMDlkODRkZjg5OTlkNDI5NjY3ZTUyZjNi"><em>"The latter. Move that cute ass."</em></p>
<p class="cnNlMTBkMjlkYmY4NTQ3OWM4N2U1ZDk2NzRmMDJkOGIw">"Mika, my dearest love, I'm teaching that refresher seminar on Samhain rituals and lore in an hour." Even as he said it, he rose and headed around the sofa, back toward his desk.</p>
<p class="cnM5Mjc1NWE2MDM5YTRmZGI5M2VjNTMzNTVjODkwMzIz"><em>"Let Vlad do it,"</em> she said. <em>"I think we have a Sidhe problem here."</em></p>
<p class="cnM0MDVhOGUyMTE4MDRmNjY5MDFiNGE5MDNmNGE1OTkw">Instead of sitting down, he put his phone down, unlocked the drawers on the left side of his desk, and opened the top one. He pulled out a gun belt with a cross-draw holster on it and buckled it on. "Urgent?"</p>
<p class="cnMyMDhkOTU5MjdjNjQwN2Q4MDQ0MzE2N2ExMzIwNThm"><em>"Here now. Men down."</em></p>
<p class="cnM1OTk5NjdmZjA3YTRiMDBhZGFlNDg3ZWM0MmFhN2Vk">From the same drawer, he pulled out his old and heavily modified LeMat centerfire revolver, then opened a second drawer that was full of boxes of .44 ammunition. He picked one marked with lavender tape and opened it, revealing what looked like off the shelf copper-jacketed hollow-points. These had the core drilled out and replaced with a cold iron penetrator, the hollow tips of the bullets were filled with a mixture of salt, ground hawthorn, mistletoe, and holly, and were sealed with beeswax.</p>
<p class="cnNjOGQzMjFjYTkzYTRmZGFiMjVmNWY4Y2M2NTQxNzY3">"Five minutes," he said. "Stay on the line so I can come straight to you." He half-cocked the gun's hammer, opened the loading gate on the oversized nine-round cylinder, and quickly loaded it. He then began sliding additional bullets into the loops on the gun belt. "What've we got?"</p>
<p class="cnMxNWJiZDRiZDRhNzQyOTk5MTE2ZjY5YjMyOTQ3Yjhl"><em>"An hour ago, the NYPD responded to reports of a young woman in spandex, carrying a rifle, harassing joggers in the park,"</em> Mika said. <em>"They have three men down, and called for SWAT support."</em></p>
<p class="cnMzMzUyYjk3MWQwNzQwODU5MDgzOTg4NDkwMWQ5ZmFj">"Okay..." Gabriel said.</p>
<p class="cnNlMjA3ZTY3YTJiMTRlOWM5OWZjMGYzOGU1MTkyNzk2"><em>"SWAT stepped in it as soon as they arrived,"</em> Mika said. <em>"They have five men down, and called for FBI support."</em></p>
<p class="cnNmMGE4YWQ4NGIxNDRhY2Y5YTJlOGZiNDdmNmMxOTg4">"And the FBI called us," he said. "But why?"</p>
<p class="cnNmNzc5Mjc1M2Q0MjRmNzZhMGI1Yjg4YjYwZDI0ZGU1"><em>"That's the fun part,"</em> Mika replied. <em>"The men are down, but aside from two of the SWAT team, they're not really injured. They're just unconscious. They were hit with some kind of sub-sonic ammunition that delivered an electrical charge like a TASER."</em></p>
<p class="cnM0MWVkYjhiYzJlOTQ5NDhiMmZkZGI3NzBjY2Q3YzUw">Gabriel paused for a moment, then finished loading the loops on his belt. "Okay, that's unusual, but not freaky enough for them to call us."</p>
<p class="cnMxMDJjYjdmMDcwNTRhYWRhYWYxMjkyYTQxMWQ0MWQw"><em>"The ammunition,"</em> Mika said, clearly having fun drawing out the revelation now, <em>"is old-fashioned home-made lead bullets, engraved with runes that look like Sidhe script to me. I can feel the residual magic on them. Big slug too...looks like a .45, but it's weird."</em></p>
<p class="cnM0YTUzM2MzNWIwNTQ4NWZhZjBhYmE5NTZkM2E0ZTQ0">Gabriel paused again, both eyebrows going up. "Weird how? Never mind, I'll see when I arrive. I've never known the Sidhe to use guns, though. What about the ones who were injured?"</p>
<p class="cnNjM2I5MDQ5YTI0YjRjOTBhOTYyMjM1YWIwY2MyNjE4">He opened a second ammo box, containing short 20 gauge shotgun shells. Each one was packed with blessed iron birdshot that he'd soaked in a solution of St. John's-wort, hawthorn, and foxglove. He opened a second loading gate in the center of the LeMat's oversized cylinder and slid one of the shotgun shells in, closed it, lowered the hammer, and holstered the pistol.</p>
<p class="cnMxMDE4MGM1OWIxZTRhMmViNGJkOGZhZmRiZjMyZDk1"><em>"Stabbed with some sort of dagger,"</em> Mika replied. <em>"In ways that are short-term disabling, but not life-threatening. Weird, isn't it."</em></p>
<p class="cnNjZWVjZjg2NGEzYTQ1YzI5M2JjZjgzYmJmZmUwYzlh">"Extremely." He went to a coat rack and grabbed a long brown oil-cloth duster, which he shrugged on over the blue jeans and brown polo shirt he was wearing as he walked back to his desk. A handful of spare shotgun shells went into the coat's pockets along with his badge wallet. "Okay, stand by, I'm inbound."</p>
<p class="cnMyYTJhMjQyNzQzZjQzNmM5NDIwZmU0YWYxYmUyNWNj">He scooped up his phone, concentrated on a mental image of his wife holding her phone to her ear, murmured a word in Latin, and vanished with a little pop of in-rushing air.</p>
<p class="cnM3Njk0Mjk0YTI2YTQ3ZmFiZmMzMjYzYmM1ZWVlZDVk"><strong> </strong></p>
<p class="cnNiYmZjMzYyYjI3ZjRlY2U4ZGJkYTczMWE5MmZjYjJj"><strong> </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p class="cnM0YzM3YjgwZTk4YTQ2MTI4ODVmYzEyNTE5NzhlMWI3" style="text-align: center"> </p>
<p class="cnM2NmM0NTAxMDUxZDRhMTM4ZTNiMzc1MDIyYzgyYmQ2" style="text-align: center"><strong>(2)</strong></p>
<p class="cnNkNDgwY2I5YTc0NzQ5NzRiNzg3M2M0OTZmYmI2MDQx"><strong> </strong></p>
<p class="cnM5NGM5YmZjMjUyZDRmMmM4MzJjYjBmNzZiOGJhMDFl">Teleportation was not Gabriel's favorite method of travel. It felt, he said, like being a watermelon getting squeezed through a garden hose, folded in half, twisted into a pretzel, and then spat out the other end. Aggressively.</p>
<p class="cnNiOTNjYjI1MTM3MzQyYjdhM2UzMjU5Nzk5ZWYzM2Fi">It was also the most efficient way he knew of to get anywhere very quickly. And he'd been doing it for so long that he'd gotten used to it.</p>
<p class="cnMzZWIzOTY4YTc4ZDRiNTBiMGYzY2RiNDY1MGQ1MDM3">Mostly.</p>
<p class="cnNkZWU4ZWEyMGI5NzQxZWRhMzAxNDdjYzczZWE3ZGY3">He stumbled a little when he appeared beside Mika in central park, bent over, retched once, then gave himself a firm shake and straightened up.</p>
<p class="cnM0MTMzMTI2ZmFmNTQxODliMzAwMDdkMmIxZjJjZTZj">Mika, the top of whose shoulder-length, light-aqua colored hair barely brushed Gabriel's chin, put away her phone and reached out to steady him. Her glittering silver irises, hidden behind sunglasses in public, watched him with a mixture of concern and amusement. She'd seen this before.</p>
<p class="cnNmZTE5MDBkMDIyMDQ5ZjNhZDJmMzQ1NmZkZjMwM2Zl">"Okay," he said as he pocketed his phone and gave himself another smaller shake, "show me the ammo."</p>
<p class="cnMwYmQ2OWFjNzBlMTRjOWM5M2Q3YzU1MWVkMGU4YzAz">Mika held out her other hand, closed into a fist. When he cupped one of his hands below hers, she opened her fingers, and a half-dozen bullets dropped into his palm.</p>
<p class="cnNkZjQ0MDQzNTdlYzQxMTQ4NWMxYjUwOGQxNzE4NDI2">The instant they touched his skin, he felt - as she'd said - the residual magic on them. It made his palm tingle.</p>
<p class="cnMzMGI5ZjJkN2IwYjQwNDlhYWI2NDYxZWE1MWYwNWM1">The bullets themselves were - again, as Mika had said - plain lead bullets that had the look and feel of being home-made rather than mass-produced. At a glance, they looked like .45 caliber, but on closer inspection they were both taller and wider at the tip than a standard .45 ACP.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZTg0Njk0Yjg2MTRiMDM4NTllMWQyMWNiNDJmZWU5">Even more curiously, although they'd clearly been fired, they were only very slightly deformed. Clearly, they hadn't hit with much impact force.</p>
<p class="cnNlZjRlZjZjMzYyYTQxZDRhZDkyMjdmYjEwYzBmN2Ew">Gabriel frowned and poked them with a finger, moving them around a little. "I know this bullet," he said absently. Then, after a moment, it clicked and he nodded. "I'd need to see one with a casing, but I think this is a .45-70. Rifle cartridge."</p>
<p class="cnM4MzAyMWZmM2U0MjQ3ZjE4MTBmZWIzYTQ4ZGViYTdm">"That fits," Mika said. "The girl is carrying a rifle of some sort. What about those runes?"</p>
<p class="cnMwY2EyMjY4NjhjMjRhMzk4ZmRlZmZlNjI3MGNjNGI5">Gabriel pushed the bullets around on his palm. Each bullet had four runes engraved on its head, spaced roughly evenly around the circumference, a fifth rune on the base, and a sixth on the blunt tip. "You're right, these are definitely Sidhe runes."</p>
<p class="cnM1YmRkMGVmNDBiOTQ0NDhhYWRkZWMwYjViMzZjNDIx">He scratched the back of his neck. "My Sidhe is very rusty, but I think the one on the base of the bullet is meant to slow it down to non-lethal speeds, and the one on the tip is tied to the other four...probably delivered the electrical charge you mentioned. I'm sure that they all invoke some sort of air magic, at least."</p>
<p class="cnNiMmRiOTk1ZDhkMjRmM2I4MmEzMGRjNGJhMzRmMjg5">He looked at Mika. "I've never seen a bullet successfully enchanted to be non-lethal before. It's a neat trick. I'll need to give these a longer look later." They went into his hip pocket.</p>
<p class="cnMxNjEzMzNiOGNhMTQ1Y2I4MmJiMTFiOWQzNzg4ODlh">Mika nodded and waited expectantly.</p>
<p class="cnMwNGNjMmQ4ZDE3OTRjNGM4ZjkzMmNjNDEzYTc5N2Vl">After a moment, Gabriel sighed. "All right, why did you really call me here? Surely you could've handled this yourself."</p>
<p class="cnMzNGY5OTBhOWY3NDQxNDM4MGZmZWI4NTAwNjEzODY4">She smirked. "Because the girl was asking for you by name."</p>
<p class="cnNmODU2YTU1YTViNzRhZDlhM2RlNDM4Y2E3YjcxZDFh">"Shit," Gabriel said, and sighed again. "All right, where is she?"</p>
<p class="cnNmZjg0NjAxYjBhZDRhZWE5N2U1ZGZkMDQ5MTk3ZmZh">Mika turned and pointed toward a thicket of bushes and short trees about forty yards from them. "She's holed up in there, and takes a shot at anybody who gets too close. She hasn't actually hit anybody since she went in there, though."</p>
<p class="cnNkYWI5OGU2N2FhMzQ3MTdhMjYwOTNjNDBjNDhhODg4">"Right," Gabriel said, shrugging his shoulders and adjusting the fall of his coat a little. "Let me go say hello."</p>
<p class="cnM5NjQ5YzhmODZiZTQ5ZjJhYmZhOGJlYzM0ZTViMTg0">Mika tugged his arm before he could go and said, very softly, "SWAT has two snipers with good lines on the thicket."</p>
<p class="cnNmYzQ0ZTkyY2Q4MDRkNjg5MjBiZGMyYjYwMGU3ODll">Gabriel frowned. "Do something about that. I don't want them shooting either the girl or me by accident."</p>
<p class="cnNhZWRhZjliODUyNDRjM2E4OTM3Yzg3MTIxMTE2NDU4">Mika smirked. "Consider it done."</p>
<p class="cnM3MmZlYWYxY2IwOTRjZjM4ZTljZWVjZTA1ZmZmZjYz"><strong> </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p class="cnM3ZWJlZDQxMDg5MzQ0NzU4NGNhYjAwODYzNDkzNjQ0"><strong> </strong></p>
<p class="cnNiMTM2ZDIzNjdmYjQwYTFhNDEzMmUwZWQ4OWVhZjhl" style="text-align: center"> </p>
<p class="cnM4YTc3ZGExMjU1YzQ4OGI5ZjRmZWNmN2IwY2RkODJk" style="text-align: center"><strong>(3)</strong></p>
<p class="cnMwMTFjMTZkMTM4NTRiNWY5NTIzZTAyNDUwOTY3ODA5"><strong> </strong></p>
<p class="cnM3ZGRhZDAyMjY3MTQ0ZDg4M2E0Y2M5MmY1OTU5ZDdl">"Hello in there!" Gabriel called as he approached the thicket. He kept his hands raised, palms outward to show that he was...if not unarmed, then at least not carrying a weapon. As he'd approached, he'd heard a soft voice singing quietly, almost too quietly to be heard, but he'd recognized the song anyway. It was unmistakable.</p>
<p class="cnM0OTk3OTAwZWUzNzQ3Njc4MmU3MDE2YjAxODVkNjc4">John Denver's 'Country Roads.'</p>
<p class="cnNhOTk1NzJmZGRmOTRhMmZiMDUxZTYxMTZiZGFiNjVk">Now, as Gabriel called out, the quiet song cut off. There was a muffled crack, and a bullet struck the ground a few feet in front of him. It was followed by a young female voice, a contralto a little higher than Mika's. To Gabriel's ear, she sounded like a teenager.</p>
<p class="cnMyZGQ2Y2QwMGM4NjRjNDI4MTI5NmVmNzU1NGYzZjQ3">"Don't you come no closer!" the girl called out. "Ah don't wanna hurt nobody!" It was followed by the familiar sound of a single-shot rifle chamber opening and closing.</p>
<p class="cnNlMGM5NzI0NzUyZDQ4Y2VhOTgyNjJjODUxZWQ0YTYx">Gabriel stopped, taking in her accent. It had some of the warm drawl of the Southern U.S. in it, mixed together with the lyrical, almost Celtic accents of the Sidhe. Her diction made his inner teacher grimace in distaste, but the syntax reminded him of accents he'd heard in the Appalachian region, especially around West Virginia.</p>
<p class="cnMxMTc3NDIzOWY0MTQ5NmViN2RjNjZmYTlhOGRhYjg5">And, he thought, she sounded tired and scared.</p>
<p class="cnMwZTFiMTU1Y2JlZjRiN2NiZTdkMzc5MGMyOWY5Zjcz">"I'm glad to hear that," he said carefully. "I don't particularly want to be hurt. My name is Gabriel. What's yours?"</p>
<p class="cnM1YjVmOWUyYTc5YjRmNzM5YjUxOTU4MmQ1NDkwNDk4">There was a momentary pause. "Gabriel O'Connell?" the girl's voice asked.</p>
<p class="cnMyMDBiODM4MGU5ZDQ5YmU4ODdjYzQ1OGE5ODM4MDc2">"That's me, yes," Gabriel replied.</p>
<p class="cnNjOGFiYjNkMjNkMTQ2NjhhZjJkZDI3ODhhYzU5OTJj">Another pause, then the girl called back, "Can Ah see some identification? Y'all ain't no Sidhe, so Ah can't count on ya to not be lyin' to me."</p>
<p class="cnM3N2U4NmZhZDFhMDQwNmM4MjIzYWJmMDNhYTg5MmI3">"Can you trust my ID?" Gabriel asked before thinking better of it and wincing slightly. "Yes, you can see some identification. I'm going to reach into my coat and toss you my badge wallet. Okay?"</p>
<p class="cnMxZjExODNmOGMzNDQ2NTRhMGEzOGJiZDgxYzJkZjE0">Her reply sounded incredibly weary. "Yeah, okay."</p>
<p class="cnM2NWUyYzNmZGRlZDRkN2FhM2MxZTU0NTE3ZWU2MDFi">Gabriel slowly reached into his coat, pulled his badge wallet out of an inner pocket, and deftly flipped it toward the sound of the voice. He heard it hit the ground, and there was a long pause.</p>
<p class="cnM3NmI1MjE5ZTUyZDQ2YjNhZTA4MThjMTFlM2M1NjU5">The iron barrel of an old rifle emerged from the thicket, pointed in the general direction of his feet. It was followed by the head and shoulders of a young woman. She had long black hair that was tied up in a messy bun at the back of her neck, and her skin was fair.</p>
<p class="cnNlZDlkZTMwZTRkYjQ2YjRiNjNmY2EyMzRkNjM0MGJj">Her cheeks were tear-stained, smudged with dirt in a couple of places, and her emerald green eyes had a haunted look to them...but the barrel of the rifle was as steady as a rock. She held the butt of the rifle firmly against her right shoulder, and Gabriel's badge wallet was dangling open from her left hand, where she held the forestock.</p>
<p class="cnMyN2Y1ZjY2ZjcxYzRkNjI4MjZmMjZiNjAwZWZiOTli">"My granny," the girl said, emerging a bit further from the thicket, "she said Ah should run to you if anything ever happened to her."</p>
<p class="cnM3ZTFjZjgyYjRhODQ2Mzk4NTUzNjJkMzk4ZDkwMWY5">"Okay," Gabriel said carefully. "Who was your granny?"</p>
<p class="cnM4N2M2OTZjMDYzYTRiZmZhMjkwN2VhMjhmYjlhMTYy">"Nightshade," the girl said softly. "They called her Nightshade."</p>
<p class="cnNhNDFlYjQ4YTZlNTQ4M2M4MTVjN2U0YmY4MmM3YmZi">Gabriel's eyebrows valiantly tried to climb up into his hairline. "Nightshade? The Sidhe assassin?"</p>
<p class="cnNlYTQyODY4MzI1ZTQ1ZmRiNjc4YTU1YjU4YmVkYjcy">The girl nodded. "She said you owed her a favor. She traded that favor ta me, in exchange for my name. Promised ta keep my name safe, and trade it back to me when I was old enough to protect it myself." Fresh tears rolled down her cheeks. "She said if anythin' ever happened ta her, I was ta run ta you and call in that favor."</p>
<p class="cnNjZGJjMTdjYmUxZDQ5ZDBiZjVmZTc4NmM1YWEwOThm">Gabriel lowered his hands. "I did owe her a favor," he said softly, sensing the power in her words. Whoever this girl was, Nightshade had indeed traded her the favor Gabriel owed the Sidhe assassin. "How can I repay it?"</p>
<p class="cnM4NTY3MmNhNWIzMTQ5MTRiNmY0YmExNDk2YWQ4MDcx">"Sanctuary," the girl said. "I need sanctuary."</p>
<p class="cnNjOTZkYTY3MDVhYjQyODliMWU3MjU2MGY3OWUyZjhm">"Come out of that thicket," Gabriel said gently. "Unload the rifle, and I'll take you somewhere safe where we can talk."</p>
<p class="cnNhMjJlZWY4ODdmNjQxNmNiNDYwOTVjY2Y5NTEzYzhl">She tipped her head slightly. "Y'all ain't gonna ask me ta disarm?"</p>
<p class="cnM1ZWQ2NTc0ZGU5NzQ5ZjNhYmE1OWEzYTFlNWYwYTkw">"No," Gabriel said with a little smile. "I'll ask you to promise not to reload the rifle though, at least until we're done talking."</p>
<p class="cnNjN2Y1YWY5M2UwZDQ4MGJhN2NhODVhYTJiNDBjMmEx">"Sanctuary," she said firmly. "Ah wanna hear ya say it."</p>
<p class="cnMyZjI2YTY2YWQ2YTQzNmJiYWY3MmEzODNiMGFlMzA1">"I'm offering you sanctuary," Gabriel said firmly, "at least for the duration of a conversation. I won't promise more than that until I know who I'm repaying that favor to."</p>
<p class="cnNlYmRlYjhiMjMyYzRjOGFhNTE2M2VkMDc1MmI1MjRi">The girl considered his words carefully for a moment, then nodded. "Yeah, all right. Suppose that's fair."</p>
<p class="cnM0NTczOTdlOTYyOTRiY2I5ODFjYWNiNzkyMTM1NGFj">She emerged fully from the bushes then, revealing the rest of herself to him. She was an inch or two shorter than Mika, dressed in dark green spandex leggings under a black leotard and a cutoff green sweatshirt that hung off her left shoulder. She wore white socks and well-worn sneakers that had been painted green at some point.</p>
<p class="cnMxZWZlMDhhYzhjZjRhYmM4MWVjMGRhNzUyMTk3MDI0">Two belts hung around her hips, one leather holding a pair of sheathed daggers - one on either hip - and a second that looked like a vintage WWII ammo belt, lined with pouches. Another piece of WWII vintage gear, a canvas Army bag, hung across her torso, resting on her left hip.</p>
<p class="cnNkZGQ1YTg5MmMzMDQ5YTlhOWRhMzVkMjgwNGJkNTZi">She didn't look a day older than eighteen.</p>
<p class="cnMyYWJiMTRhN2M4YzQ5MzM5ZTZmNjc3OWI4M2IwYzVj">As requested, she lowered the rifle and worked the lever, which turned out to be the trigger guard. A block dropped down and she slid the cartridge - definitely a .45-70, Gabriel saw - out before closing the lever up again. She slid the cartridge into one of the pouches on her ammo belt, then looped the rifle's strap over her right shoulder.</p>
<p class="cnM5NGQ3ZTJkYWVhNjQ3MWI4OWJiODdlZGRjYjA3MTFi">As she did that, Gabriel saw rows of small runes running the length of the rifle's barrel. "Is that a Sharps? Model...1874, right?"</p>
<p class="cnM4Y2Q3ZTRmYzMxYjQ4MjI5MzQyMzBiMGEyYTkwODY2">A little smile appeared on the girl's face. "Yeah."</p>
<p class="cnM4MmRkMDQ1YzA3MzQzMWU5ZDMwYjJmYzgwNTZmZjlh">"Good gun," Gabriel said. He almost asked for her name again, then remembered what she'd said about trading it to her granny, and instead asked, "What can I call you?"</p>
<p class="cnMwMTk2MjEwZGQ5YzQ0OTliNDUyNmNkNmZiMjJhMTM5">"Windsong," the girl said softly. "Most'a the fairies called me Windsong. Suppose you can too."</p>
<p class="cnM4NmIxZWNmYzY5MDQxYjhiY2QyOWFkMDE5ZTJmNWEz"><strong> </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p class="cnNmZDQ0YjlhMDMxMDQzYmE5YjkwMjRlYWM2MTY4Mjlm"><strong> </strong></p>
<p class="cnMyOGE5YjQ1NmNkMTRmMDk5MzY3ODViMDEzMTc2ZDI4" style="text-align: center"> </p>
<p class="cnNjMmI4ZmY1OTczYTRiN2Q5NGE3MzZiMTAyYWJhOWJl" style="text-align: center"><strong>(4)</strong></p>
<p class="cnM4NzdhYzEzMmJiNjQwYTRiMDgzM2RmYjViZGY4ZmNm"><strong> </strong></p>
<p class="cnM3NzJlYTQ3ZDcxODQ2MThhYWM3YWE2ODM1ODJlMThm">"What," Mika asked about an hour later, "like the John Denver song?"</p>
<p class="cnNjZmJkNmMxZDhhYTQ4OWU5NzRjNjVjYTg3ZWFiYTM4">"I suspect so," Gabriel replied. "Pretty sure I heard her singing 'Country Roads' to herself when I approached the thicket."</p>
<p class="cnM3YTM1YWM5MzA0ZTQxMmQ4MTBlZTcxYTFlYWJlYzI5">They were back in UNSDI headquarters, under the United Nations building. The girl, Windsong, had been set up in an interrogation room, though efforts had been made to make the room a bit less intimidatingly cold.</p>
<p class="cnMwN2I4ODZlN2Q2NTRlMjBiODIxMzdkODE3ODYwMjAw">There was still a table in the middle of the room, but the chairs at it were cushioned folding chairs instead of the usual hard metal ones. A second table had been brought in and put along the wall behind where the girl sat facing the door.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZDUxMDJmMjQ2NTQ4ODM4YjM0ZjNiZTc4OTgwY2Rm">When asked politely, by Gabriel, she had divested herself of her gear, laying it all out on the table and unpacking it to show him what was in it.</p>
<p class="cnMxZTY1ZWVkZWNlYTRkNDU5OTYyM2JjYzQyYzFkMGFk">The Army bag had held a single change of clothes - another leotard, a pair of leggings, and socks - and some survival gear: A half-full canvas-wrapped steel canteen, a tinder box, a package of dried meat, a wedge of hard cheese wrapped in waxed cloth, two rolls of bandages, several spools of thread, and a variety of herbs in little packages. And, at the very bottom, a carefully tied up bundle of surprisingly modern paracord.</p>
<p class="cnM4NjhlOGI4YzM3MzRmYjE4ZDA4MWViNTU3N2I0OTQ4">The girl even allowed him to examine one of her daggers. They were identical, the hilts made of brass and wrapped in leather, with a narrow W-shaped cross-guard. The blades were made of exquisitely carved transparent aqua-blue crystal, and they fairly vibrated with magic to Gabriel's senses. He pointedly did not ask how they were enchanted, but he saw more of the Sidhe runes on both the hilts and the blades.</p>
<p class="cnMxYWQxNjVjMDVmYjQ0ZTY5OTJmZjhkY2M1MjQyYWE3">The ammo belt contained a variety of home-made cartridges, all of them engraved with different rune sets, a Swiss Army knife, a small sewing kit, and a few small personal possessions, including a whetstone, a metal stylus with a tip made from the same strange blue crystal as her daggers and which hummed with gentle magic in Gabriel's hand, and an old flip-top metal lighter. She was also wearing, she showed him, two pendants on silk cords around her neck…a Star of David, and a pentacle, both in silver.</p>
<p class="cnM4NGVkMjVmNDYwNDRjOWY4NDUwYTYwOWI1YzE4ODQ3">Now she sat at the table in the middle of the interrogation room, finishing a meal; two hamburgers, a pile of fries, and a soda, which she'd attacked like she hadn't eaten in days. Gabriel and Mika stood together in the adjacent room, watching her through a one-way mirror.</p>
<p class="cnNiNjQwYzJkZWFiNjRiYmU4NGM4MWY1YjJiNTExNGZm">"Did you notice her skin?" Mika asked. "I'd kill for skin that smooth and flawless."</p>
<p class="cnNlN2Y1OGNjZTVkMjQ4ZjdiYWI5MzVmZjc4OTIwMWY0">"I noticed," Gabriel said thoughtfully. "Her eyes are strange too...when she looked up at me, when the light hit them, they almost looked iridescent. Like a soap bubble was stretched across them."</p>
<p class="cnMzN2M5NjBmZGM3ZDRkMDRiNmVjMmEzNzUxYTI4NGU3">"How long was she in Faerie?" Mika asked.</p>
<p class="cnM5OGZjZmQ1YTRmNTRmMzY4ZmJlNDVlMDU3MDJlNWQ0">On the other side of the one-way mirror, Windsong looked up from the remains of her second burger and turned her eyes directly toward them. <em>"4,380 days,"</em> she said, picked up by a microphone in the room. <em>"Twelve years, ta the day. And it ain't polite ta talk about a girl like she ain't sittin' right here, ya know."</em></p>
<p class="cnM2M2EwOGE3ZTdjYTRlZDA4YTJlMzExNzViOTViMmJl">Mika twitched. Gabriel's eyebrows went up.</p>
<p class="cnMzNTlkOGExZDMxZjRmNTFhZDA1Mjg2YWMwYjI3YzZh">"All right," he said, "mind if we join you, then?"</p>
<p class="cnNkZjc3ODllYzhjMDQ1ODZiYjU3Yjc5OGM5MGQ5Mjg3"><em>"Nah,"</em> the girl replied, <em>"let's have that talk ya wanted before repayin' my granny's favor and grantin' me sanctuary."</em></p>
<p class="cnMyNWExNzcxYTg4NTQ5ZWE4ODQzYzg1YzQ1YjIwMTQ2">They sat down on the other side of the table from Windsong, as she pushed her now-empty plate to one side. "All right," she said, folding her hands on the table in front of her, "what do ya want to know?"</p>
<p class="cnM3Y2ZiMDQ2ZTI2MjQ1NTk4NDU5N2ZlZWE4NWU5YWFk">"Do you remember your real name?" Gabriel asked, taking out a notepad and a pen. "Maybe we can locate your parents."</p>
<p class="cnNlMmM3MmVhN2YxNTQ5M2E5OGZhOTBmYzA5NTA0ZDY3">"After twelve years?" the girl asked. "And no, I don't remember it. I traded it to Granny for safe keepin', like I told ya."</p>
<p class="cnM2NGIyZWZjNzBmMjQxMTA5MDg5ZjAwODI4MzE4NmFj">"For the favor I owed her," Gabriel said, then smiled a little. "It's not like the Sidhe to trade away a potentially powerful favor, even for a name."</p>
<p class="cnM0ZGNkMTAwOWY3NjQ0Mjc5MWExNmE1ODZmZGY4MDkz">"They ain't all tricksters tryin' to get one over on ya," Windsong said. Then she ruefully added, "Most of 'em, sure, but Granny weren't like that."</p>
<p class="cnM4Njc1NDQ4OGM3MTQwMzY4NWRjZWYyOWM5MmI2N2I0">Gabriel and Mika exchanged a look.</p>
<p class="cnMwZGUzNjU4NzllNDQzNzY5MmYzMjA0NmJiYTdmMzli">"She weren't!" Windsong said defensively. "When I couldn't find my way home, Granny took me in, fed and clothed me, taught me how ta track and hunt, how ta walk the Ways without gettin' lost, even taught me ta read and write English and Gaelic, some arithmetic, and how ta use Sidhe runes."</p>
<p class="cnMxM2ViNzVkMDVkNDRjNWQ5OGE5ODYxMGQxZTllMDIz">"Gaelic?" Mika asked curiously.</p>
<p class="cnM4YWQyYThjYmIxZjRmMDlhZDA1NTcxMmUyYTI5YmM5">"Traditional Sidhe language," Gabriel said, taking notes, "at least for the last five or six hundred years."</p>
<p class="cnM1N2ExY2Y2ZWExMjQ2YjY4NmM1NTIzNjM4NTZjZGRi">"But there's a cost for such learnin'," Windsong said. "Granny promised to teach me what she knew, but I had ta serve her until my eighteenth birthday. Then we'd renegotiate."</p><span class="cjA1OTE3MDg1MDYxZTQ5Njk5MWFjMDFlYzYzMGRkOGFh"><br/>The tale has been stolen; if detected on Amazon, report the violation.<br/></span>
<p class="cnMyNGM3MzM3OWI0YjQ0ODFiZGMzNTI2OTNhNzc0NjQ1">"Pretty standard exchange," Gabriel noted. "Was it hard work?"</p>
<p class="cnNiMTQzMWRmYzc2NTQyY2Y5ZDQ2OTRjMGIzMWJmNzA1">"Nah, not until I was old enough - and strong enough - ta do it," Windsong replied.</p>
<p class="cnM1OWMwMGNjYmNjMzQwMTI5MjNkN2IzN2QxZjRmNmY4">"Huh," Gabriel scribbled a few more notes. "But she never took you home?"</p>
<p class="cnM3NzZhZjFjNTg1ZDQwNWNiZTMxODVkZTFmMDlhNzE3">The girl looked sheepish. "She tried once, when Ah was seven, but said my parents didn't live at the address I remembered no more. Ah think...Ah think they was gettin' ready ta move when I got lost."</p>
<p class="cnM0Y2ZhMzU1YTZiNzRiYWY5YTVhMGEwZjc1ZDRkMjQx">Mika nudged Gabriel gently. "Let's start at the beginning," she said, "before we get lost in the story. When and where were you born?"</p>
<p class="cnNiNDVjYjVjZjMyODQ1NGM5MDE2OWI0OTBhZjM2ZjAx">Windsong straightened a little. "Ah ain't telling ya that without somethin' in..." She trailed off and looked sheepish. "Sorry. Ain't used ta dealin' with other humans. Them questions...Sidhe'd try ta get that information ta control or hurt me."</p>
<p class="cnMyODZhODhhOWM4NjQ5ZjM4YTgwYTBkNmNjMzEzMDI2">"We promise," Gabriel said seriously, "that we won't use anything you tell us about yourself against you magically. What we will do is use that information to try to help you find your family, and help you find your way in the mortal world."</p>
<p class="cnMxZTgwMWIxY2JiNzQ0OTU5MGJmNjc0N2E0ZDdhOWFh">The girl considered that for a moment, then nodded. "That's a good trade anyway. Thank ya kindly."</p>
<p class="cnM3YTMzNjY2NDM2NjRlZTJiOWRmZjQ1NmRhZDc4ODBh">She shifted a little and seemed to be collecting her thoughts, before finally starting again. "Ah was born on October 30th, 1979, in Wheeling, West Virginia. my parents names were Ruth and Adam, but Ah can't remember the last name, 'cause of the trade Ah made with Granny." She paused for a moment, then added an address in Wheeling. "That's where we lived, at least 'till I was six. That's when Ah got lost."</p>
<p class="cnNlZGU2NjU4MjdhYzRlNmFiNTA4ZTdlYjVmM2Q3NzMz">"Wait," Mika said, tipping her head a little. "You said you were born in 1979, and got lost when you were six?"</p>
<p class="cnNiZDc4Yzg2YThhNDQ1NWZhMTkzZDJhMWE5YmYzY2U1">"Yeah," Windsong said. "1985. Halloween, it was, when Ah got lost. 31st of October. My momma and daddy had taken me to a community thing of some sort at a big synagogue over in some city..." She trailed off and shrugged. "Don' remember where."</p>
<p class="cnNlN2RlNDJlN2UzMTRhMjJiMmQ3ODRkZTE4MzEzNDNj">"Could've been Pittsburgh," Gabriel said, taking notes. "It's only about an hour and a half away."</p>
<p class="cnNkMjI2NDIzNTRkMjRkZTE5MGJiNmYxMDhjYWNkOGQ4">"Ah do remember bein' in the car for a while," Windsong agreed. "Anyway, Ah was playin' with some other little kids -"</p>
<p class="cnM5NDM3MTFjNGRjNzQzMmU4NmU4ZjhhODIxYjQwYjZl">Mika held up a hand to stop her. "Hang on. How old are you?"</p>
<p class="cnM1MGYwMzIyZWFjNzRjNDY5NTUzZjQwNDgwMTk2ZmNi">"Eighteen. Just today. Happy birthday ta me." Windsong shrugged. "Granny made sure Ah kept track of the time. Said she didn't want me ta be like no pixie and not know the passage of time."</p>
<p class="cnM4NTQ2Njg5Njc0YjQzMTk4NDgwOGI2ZTZhMWY4NjM2">Gabriel and Mika exchanged a look, then Mika gently asked, "What year do you think it is?"</p>
<p class="cnM3MWVkMTIyZWY1MjQ0MDc4NTM4MzllNGQxMWM0Mjk2">Windsong tipped her head, then did a bit of mental arithmetic. "It'll be...1997 now, yeah? That car we rode in here in was pretty slick, but Ah always figured the future'd be shiny. Ah remember Daddy sayin' he expected everybody'd have a computer at home before too long, but damn...computer in the car? That was cool."</p>
<p class="cnMzOGVhYjBlNWU5ODRmZGI5YjYwOGQwMGJiMGJmMGE0">There was another brief, silent exchange between Gabriel and Mika, then Mika said softly, "Windsong, it's October 30th, 2017."</p>
<p class="cnMxZGY3NmYxOGUwYTRkZmVhYWY4NzEwZDE5NzQzMzVk">The girl sat back in her chair, blinking iridescent green eyes at them. Then she laughed. "That's a joke, right? Granny told me mortals liked ta joke about serious things."</p>
<p class="cnMzYzkxMDZiN2JlZDRhOTE4ZjE1ZjE4MDEzNjc2Njgw">Gabriel shook his head. "No, that's today's date." He pulled out his cell phone, swiped it open, then launched the calendar app and turned it to face her.</p>
<p class="cnNlMGFlZGY4MjA3ODRlOGZiMTFjOGRjN2FjY2ZjNTFk">Windsong leaned forward and stared at it. Tentatively, she reached out and touched the screen, causing an appointment to expand. She twitched back, eyes wide and more than a little scared. "Ah was gone thirty-two years?" she asked incredulously. Then she frowned, hugged herself, and huffed. "Nah, it tracks. Goddamn Faerie. Forget the Sidhe, forget all the monsters...Faerie itself was always a fuckin' step ahead of ya..."</p>
<p class="cnNjYzE0MGU2MTNiODRkM2M5ZmI0MTdlYTI1NzliMWY2">Tears were rolling down her cheeks by then, and she swiped them away angrily. "Lost my granny, Ah'd hoped Ah'd at least be able ta find my way back ta my real parents finally..." A little sob escaped her and she covered her face with her hands, her shoulders shaking.</p>
<p class="cnNiNGNiYzM0MGU4NzRjNWJhZTRkYTMyMmYxOGUzNTRh"><strong> </strong></p>
<p class="cnM3OWZkYzAwZmUyZTQyMDE4YzY2MjFjYTdiZTJkOGZk"><strong> </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p class="cnM3ODdkMjFhYjQ0YzQxYjI5NmVjZjNkZWNjMmVhMDUx" style="text-align: center"> </p>
<p class="cnNiNmMxYTFkMTZlMDRiMWFhMjZmMGIxOWYyNDQ2ODM3" style="text-align: center"><strong>(5)</strong></p>
<p class="cnMyOTg2OTUxZGM5YTQ0YjRiNGM5ZTE0ZDIwMjViODZl"><strong> </strong></p>
<p class="cnNjMjUyMWMwN2RjODQ0NDVhMjRhNWI0NzgxMmQ4MWM2">Mika was around the table in an instant, crouching down and hugging the girl gently. "It's okay," she said softly. "It'll be okay, I promise. We'll help you." She gave Gabriel a firm look as she said it.</p>
<p class="cnM2MWEzMWUxZmFiOTQzYWVhMmI0YmEzNTYzMTZiZmUy">He nodded and tapped his pen on his notebook. "We'd like to hear the rest of your story, of course, but consider your granny's favor covered. You have sanctuary here, with us, for as long as you need it." He rose. "I'll be right back."</p>
<p class="cnM5MjdiZTZlM2E3NjQ1YzFiMzNkNjExYTVjODllMGVm">He returned a minute or two later with a box of tissues, which he placed on the table, and a trash can, which he set on the floor nearby. Mika pulled a few tissues and handed them to Windsong, who took them and blew her nose.</p>
<p class="cnNjMDRkMDA3N2I2OTQzNTFiNmFjOTM1MzA5MmNlOTQw">They waited patiently while she pulled herself back together, wiped her eyes, and caught her breath. "Ah'm okay," she said finally, sniffling a little. "It was just..."</p>
<p class="cnM4Mjg2MGI5NTEyNDRiYTY4NzFiMTFmYmY1ZTY0N2Y3">"A nasty shock," Gabriel said, nodding. "We've all had those. We get it. Take your time."</p>
<p class="cnMzN2RhOTI0ZDhjOTQ1MzRiZjdlMTBjOGE4MThjMmRl">Her skin, Gabriel noticed, was still smooth, fair, and flawless. There was just the faintest hint of a flush on her cheeks, but none of the blotchy look he expected from someone who'd been crying. Her time in Faerie had definitely left a permanent mark on the girl.</p>
<p class="cnM2MzQ0M2ViYjE0YTRmZDRiOTUwODYxNDY1ZDFkOWVi">Finally, Windsong blew her nose one more time and disposed of the tissue. "Thank ya for fulfillin' the favor ya owed my granny. Ah'll..." She hesitated, then shrugged. "Dunno what Ah'll do now."</p>
<p class="cnM4MTdlNzAxNjg2NDRkZTA5Zjg2Mjc4YTk2Y2FkZWRj">Mika squeezed her shoulder gently, then moved around the table and sat back down. "Finish your story, if you want. If you don't know what else to do with yourself, and we can't locate your parents, you can stay here. It sounds like you have skills we could use."</p>
<p class="cnM0NjdkNWU2M2VjYzQ4ZDlhNmRhMjFkYzlmZjI4MDli">Gabriel nodded firmly. "Someone who knows how to walk the Ways would be of incredible value, even without the other survival skills. And you said you learned to track?"</p>
<p class="cnNhMzkyYWU0ZjI0YTQ0NjdiNmI0NDkzY2I2M2YyMzYz">Windsong sniffled a little and nodded. "Granny, she was one of the best trackers in Faerie, everybody said so. And she taught me all of her tricks. Said Ah was her protégé."</p>
<p class="cnNmMzhjNzUwMjkzODQyYzM4MTczMmI4MTFjOTk2N2Uz">Gabriel nodded again. "I remember. That's what I owed her the favor for, actually...she tracked someone down for me when nobody else could find them."</p>
<p class="cnNkMmFhOTI1NTc0MDQ0MTA5ZjJlZWI1OGRlMjg5ZGNm">Windsong lifted her chin proudly. "Granny was the best."</p>
<p class="cnMzMjUyMDU1MzA0ZjRiNDU4ZWM3ZGM1YWI2NGI4N2I0">"So," Mika said, hoping to get things back on track, "you were playing with some other little children at that synagogue..."</p>
<p class="cnM2YzdkYmE3ZjkxMDQyYTBhNDJjY2Y1YWFiNDNhODAw">Windsong nodded. "Yeah. Ya ever been in one of those big temples? Once ya get out of the sanctuary and common hall, it's all plain white hallways and door after door...Ah got lost playin' hide and seek. At first, Ah could still hear people, but after a while it was just one hallway after another, after another, and they all looked the same. All of the doors were locked, and Ah kept takin' turns, sure that the next one'd take me back to my parents..."</p>
<p class="cnM5YzEzMzQyZGQxZTQwZGU4MmYzOTliZmMxYmE1Zjdl">She sucked in a shaky breath and let it out. "After a while, Ah was tired, so Ah just...curled up on the floor, figured someone'd find me eventually. And when Ah woke up, Ah was in the woods, and there was a bunch of fairies hoverin' around me. They took me ta Granny, and she took me in."</p>
<p class="cnM4OGFhMTViOTExOTRmOTJiMjA2OTIyMTVmMWI4MDY0">"So she taught you everything you know," Mika said.</p>
<p class="cnNmMjExOGQwZjJkMjRmOWVhYWMxNjNiNzU1MDIwYzMy">"Nah," Windsong said, "not everything. But an awful lot. Some of the secrets Ah know Ah traded little favors to other Sidhe for. And fairies, and sylphs...an uncommonly friendly grimalkin taught me the secret of stalkin' prey by scent, without bein' seen or heard, and how ta all but disappear in shadows. Stuff like that."</p>
<p class="cnMwOWY0YWQxYjQ2ZTQ1ZjRiOGQ2ZWNiYjFiOTQ2NmNl">She looked at Mika. "Had a youngish dragon teach me basic accountin'. That's how Ah know what you are. Ah can smell dragon on ya. At a guess, I'd say your father was a dragon."</p>
<p class="cnNhZDg3ODk1ZGRlNTQ2YmVhZDMzM2YxYjFkZTZmZjY1">Mika looked startled, then nodded. "Yeah. A Shenlong."</p>
<p class="cnM3NmRkNjU3NThkYzQ4MzM4ZDFiNzRhM2MzNDgxOWMx">Windsong nodded. "Makes sense. Explains the hair and eyes. Yours are lovely, by the way."</p>
<p class="cnMyNmU2YjFlYTIyZTRjN2Q4Y2E5NWE5MTU1MmQwOTk1">"Thank you," Mika said. "Yours are very unusual, but very pretty."</p>
<p class="cnMwOWZmNWVmNzdmODQ5MGI5NWNlMmY2ODBiMmJmOTg5">Windsong inclined her head politely. "Traded a young sylph some huntin' tricks for the secret of farseeing, made my eyes a little odd. Poor thing's the youngest of five sisters, and they ain't takin' proper care of her. She's gonna turn on them one of these days. We learned a lot from one another."</p>
<p class="cnMzNjFiZGE2YWE2ZDRmOGY4ZTIyZjJjZTI1MWY5ZWNm">"If I may ask," Gabriel said carefully, "knowing your granny, did she teach you her profession?"</p>
<p class="cnMyYzYzNjdiZThjNzRkYmZhZTI4YjkxMjM2NzMzMDEy">The girl sat quietly for a moment, then nodded a little. "Yeah, she did. Ah'm good at it, too. But Ah only ever took jobs on people from Faerie. It was good coin ta trade for secrets and things Ah needed. But Ah never killed no mortals. Granny made me promise ta never kill no mortals, as long as I was hers. Said it'd change me."</p>
<p class="cnM3ZjM5ODY3YjUxNjRlYzk4MTE4YTQxZGQ2NjAxZmFh">Gabriel relaxed a little. "That gives you a pretty large pile of skills that make you uncommonly suited to work for the UNSDI. Maybe that's why she sent you to us."</p>
<p class="cnM2ZTRlNDU5YmZmYTQzMzNiM2RjODZjM2M1NmNmMzgw">Windsong's expression closed down a little. "Ah think Ah'd need ta learn a lot more about ya before workin' for ya."</p>
<p class="cnNjYzllZjIyZTkzMDQ4Yzg5MTEzNTM1MmQ0MDEwNzYz">"That's entirely fair," Gabriel said with a smile. "But I wanted you to know that the option is on the table, whether we can find your parents or not."</p>
<p class="cnMwMGU1OTkyN2NhMzQ5NDI4YTY2NmJhZWZmZmQwOGQ4">"Good ta know," the girl replied with a nod. Then she sighed. "Ya really think ya can find them? After...thirty-two years? My god."</p>
<p class="cnMwMjM5OTE4NTYzZTQ0MTdhNWUxZTEwNzQwOGQ4MTc5">"I think we stand a decent chance," Mika said. "We'll have you sit for a physical -"</p>
<p class="cnMzNmFkZjI2M2E4ZTRmOWE5ZTUwYWI0M2FmZTkwNWQ1">"That's where a doctor examine's ya, yeah?" Windsong asked.</p>
<p class="cnM2YjE3ZTdjZjdlNDQxNThiYzM1OTg0MTljNGRhZTk1">"Yes..." Mika said carefully. "Why?"</p>
<p class="cnM1Yjg4NDc3ZGY0ZTQzNTM4Njg3MGQ4NTRiMDY0ZmVh">"Ain't never done that before," the girl replied. "Ain't no doctors in Faerie, just healers, and ya only go ta them if yer hurt."</p>
<p class="cnM0NWIxZWE5Y2QwOTRmMmE4ZTM2ZmNmZTEzMTFiNGNh">"Well," Mika said, "eighteen is a good age to get a fresh baseline of your general physical health."</p>
<p class="cnMxOTY4YWIzYzczMzRhMzNiNzAwNDVkZGYwNWYwZjZj">"Sounds smart," Windsong nodded.</p>
<p class="cnNmYzg2OTkzNjg2YzQyNzZhMGZhMzdhNDhjYzFlYTIw">They were all silent for a moment, then Mika continued. "Anyway, as part of a full physical, the doctors will draw some blood to run tests -"</p>
<p class="cnMxZDE2YmU0M2JjNzRiMWVhMzEyOTBkZDg2OWNlZjk0">"Woah now," Windsong held up a hand. "Ain't nobody takin' my blood for no reason."</p>
<p class="cnM1MzhlMTg5M2JhODRjMjlhOTY0NjQ1MTEyN2Y4OTEy">Gabriel smiled a little. "They have to run blood tests to look for certain diseases and genetic problems," he said gently. "A DNA sample will also help us find your parents, especially if they ever reported you missing."</p>
<p class="cnM5NzdjMWUzYzQ2NDQ0NmNiYmYyNTdiMGU3ZGYyM2M5">"Oh," she said quietly. "That...makes good sense. But..."</p>
<p class="cnMxNmFjOWRlZjQ4MjQ0M2JiYmFlMTRjY2Y0OWNkMzll">"Will you do it if I personally promise to make sure the samples are destroyed when they've done everything they need to with them, and that they're not used for any purpose other than your physical and searching for your parents?" Gabriel asked.</p>
<p class="cnNiNWJmNzYyYWJlMjQyMGJiMzVhM2JlNWFmMmExYThi">She thought about that, then nodded. "Granny wouldn't've sent me to ya if she didn't trust ya. That means Ah should too."</p>
<p class="cnNkNTA1OTIzNzliNTQzM2Y4ODJjNDZkNWUxNjBjMWYw">"Thank you," Gabriel said. "You keep referring to Nightshade in the past tense...will you tell us what happened?"</p>
<p class="cnM5YmEyYWQ3ZjZlNjQwZTE5YTkwNDhmYzE0YWUxOTZm">Windsong was silent for a minute, then she hissed, "The Queen of fuckin' Air and Darkness happened." She spat into the trash can. "Granny..." She looked down at the tabletop. "I think Granny might've been usin' me all along. Which ain't all that surprisin', and she still did me a lot more good than harm, Ah'm thinkin'."</p>
<p class="cnM4ODA5NmU3ZGIwNDRmMWRhNTBhNTFlYmJjMDgxODFh">"Oh?" Gabriel asked.</p>
<p class="cnNmMzMzMzVhYmM2MTQ4MmE5MDAyOWM4YzNiM2JhNjMw">Windsong nodded slowly. "Yeah. See, as Ah understand it, she had a blood feud with one of the Winter Queen's chief retainers. The Queen made her vow not to harm the sonofayouknowwhat by her own means."</p>
<p class="cnM0NTAzMTgxNjM1YzQ3OTFiMjJmNjAyODA1N2Y5NDA1">Gabriel nodded, understanding. "So she trained you up, then sent you after him."</p>
<p class="cnM5NTdiOTY5YTA4NzRhMzRhYmRiM2FmYTBmNmUxY2U5">"She told me takin' him out for her would square my lingering debts with her," Windsong confirmed. "I was almost eighteen, lookin' ahead to findin' my own way home, or at least gettin' my name back in exchange for a few more years of trainin'. So I wanted us square."</p>
<p class="cnMwYWI0NzNjOTI2MTRmNDZhZmJkZmM2ZjlkYTVmN2Uy">"Makes sense," Mika observed. "And it didn't bother you, being sent to kill a Winter Sidhe?"</p>
<p class="cnNiOTk3MmVmM2JkNTRmZGZhYjdjZjdlYWJkMzI3ZWQ3">"Nah," Windsong flapped a dismissive hand. "Ya live long enough with the Sidhe, ya come to realize most of 'em are real shitheels who'd sell their own loved ones - if they had any - for more power. Those in Winter are more calculatin' and more cautious than those in Summer, but they're all predators at heart, and in their eyes, everyone who's not them is either a bigger, badder predator, or potential prey. I ain't got no qualms about puttin' a bullet in one of them, not for the right reason."</p>
<p class="cnNjYzM1NjJjMGVkNDRmNmJhYzZhNThkZmIwNGQyMDYy">"The right price?" Mika asked dryly.</p>
<p class="cnNlOWEwMjA3MTI0MjQwODdiMTZjZGJmZTgwZWE2Mjkz">Windsong shrugged. "Po-tay-toe, po-tah-toe."</p>
<p class="cnNhMTQ4ZWNiNDkzYTQ2NDk4NmZiYmYzOTQ5NWVlNGMw">Mika blinked a few times, then huffed a little laugh. "Yeah, all right. I suppose you're not wrong. It's a bit mercenary, but...pretty much everyone at the UNSDI has done things they're not overly proud of or that they had to do to survive."</p>
<p class="cnMxNzZkOTIzMmE4OTQzM2Y4OWQ1YjgzNmM5NDEzMTNm">"Ask Vlad," Gabriel muttered. Mika kicked his ankle under the table.</p>
<p class="cnNhMTAxYTYyMTM4NDRiMGFiMmQ5MmJhNDQ5ZTc4YTVi">"Vlad?" Windsong asked.</p>
<p class="cnMwNjIzMDUyZDJjNzRlM2I4YWVlNjU2MzdiNmQ4YjQ4">"Sorry, I'm being a smartass," Gabriel said with a wry smile. "One of our senior field officers is Vlad Tepes."</p>
<p class="cnM4ZmZkNWRhYTQzOTRkMWE4NzkxYzRmMzc0NGJmMWYw">Windsong's eyes widened. "Ah heard of him...he works for you?"</p>
<p class="cnMyNjlkNjNmMjA1ZDQyOTE5Njk0YTlkOWQyNjVjNTQz">"Yeah," Gabriel replied quietly. "He's trying to make amends for a lot of mistakes and bad things he did."</p>
<p class="cnMzNjU1NTNhOGZjMjQ3OWVhMzc3NjE2ZjMxYzBjMWMy">Windsong sat back in her chair. "Huh. Ah suppose anythin' I did would seem pretty tame by comparison."</p>
<p class="cnNkMzkzMzBiZGEwMjQyNDJhMjEwMWU1OGI3NmVmYWM5">"Anything just about anybody did would," Mika murmured. Gabriel kicked her ankle under the table.</p>
<p class="cnNhMDliN2FkNDM5MTQ3ZDY5ZjZjMGFiNDFkZTY3Y2Rl">"Anyway," Windsong said, deciding it was her turn to keep the conversation on track, "I did the deed, came home, and went for a run."</p>
<p class="cnM1YmU5ZWFlZGY3ZDQxZWZiZjQ2ZDg2MjBlNWU4ODYz">"Thus the spandex?" Mika asked, amused.</p>
<p class="cnMwOGVhODVkNDA1OTQ3MTliMmQwMWIwNDlkYWZiZjAx">Windsong shrugged. "It's more comfortable than running in that frippery that fairies like to wear. Ah was out a few hours and got back in time to see the Queen of Air and Darkness holdin' Granny by the throat. Guess even doin' the deed through me was close enough ta 'by her own means' for Her Royal Frozen Highness to come down on her like a hammer."</p>
<p class="cnM2ODI5NWRjMzg2NjQyYzU5NGU0OWFhMDI0N2ZiZTgw">She sighed softly. "Granny told me ta run, so I ran. Took nothin' but the clothes on my back an' the kit I was carryin'. That was two days ago, at least for me," she amended after a moment's though. "Took me that long to work out the last bits of the ritual Granny'd been workin' on to help me get back home. And here Ah am."</p>
<p class="cnNhMTY0ZTgwZjYyODQyODg4OGMwZDA0YzYyMWI4NGZh">"Do you always go for a run with survival gear and weapons?" Mika asked curiously.</p>
<p class="cnMwY2EzYWY3M2E5YTQyMDdiMzU1NmU4MGQ2ODVhZDMz">"Sure," Windsong said. "Granny always told me, run like ya mean it. That means do it carryin' stuff I'd normally have with me." She sighed again. "Didn't lose nothin' I can't replace, but I surely will miss my guitar."</p>
<p class="cnM4N2IyZTJiMDI0NjRiMDliYjViYjllMTQxYzY4OGNk">"Shouldn't be hard to get you a decent replacement," Gabriel said. "Mika, why don't you take her down to medical and get her looked over while I arrange a suite for her in the dorms."</p>
<p class="cnNkZmUwZmE3OTM4NTQ2YTU5ZTEwMjhlMDhiMGIzZDE5">Mika rose and nodded. "Good idea. Come on, Windsong. Let's get you settled, and see if we can help you find your family."</p>
<p class="cnMxODRjM2VhMjE0MzRiZTFhM2UwZjUwZDQ5YjUxOWJl">"Lemme just get my things," the girl replied, rising as well. "And thank ya. Thank ya both kindly."</p>

<p class="cnNlNDI3OGU4NWZjYzRlNDBiY2U0NTMxYTIwYjlhY2Ni">Windsong ran lightly across the tops of the pine trees, moving almost too quickly to follow.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZTEwNzEyOGZjMDQ0OGM4MjYwYTE0NWYyN2ExMDVh">The toes of her black sneakers barely touched the tip of each tree before she was on her way to the next, the trees themselves swaying ever so slightly, as if moved by a gentle breeze. Her passage didn't even shake loose any of the snow that capped the trees, because she never stayed in one place for more than half a heartbeat.</p>
<p class="cnMzZmNjODhmY2FkOTRkM2Y5NWJlM2NiMWI0MTNlY2E0">She barely even seemed to be breathing as she ran, only the faintest little puffs of condensation escaping into the cold air with each breath.</p>
<p class="cnM2Nzc1NzI3YmM0MjRhOGRhNTEwZjA0OWI3MGZkYzJm">She wore tight black leggings under a dark gray hoodie, her thumbs hooked through loops in the hoodie's wristbands and her arms tucked tightly against her sides. The hood was pulled up over her head, and she leaned forward slightly as she ran, her eyes fixed firmly ahead.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZDYzMGFkMDkyNDQwNzFhZmQzOTIwZWZjNTc1YTkw">Between the overcast sky, threatening more snow, the dark green of the pine trees, and her dark clothes, she was as close to invisible as any mortal could be as she ran.</p>
<p class="cnNhMTc0MzU2OTAwNDRlYzNiZGNhMzY4MmQ3NjRmMDkw">Occasionally she paused, dropping down a little to place both feet on a branch and catch hold of the trunk of the tree for balance, still not knocking any of the snow loose. There, she would lift her face to the chill, darkening sky, and inhale deeply through her nose.</p>
<p class="cnM2NzQ3OTA4OWFjNDQ0NjliMjUyYzJjODJlMjY4NDBi">During one such pause, Mika's voice finally spoke in her left ear. She'd taken the earbud - which Mika had said would let them talk to one another and allow Mika to follow her, making her marvel at how far headphones had come from the last time she'd seen any - and and put it in her ear as instructed before starting her run. But this was the first time Mika had said anything since.</p>
<p class="cnNhMDNjODA5NTA1YzRlMzE4MDVhYzA5MTIwM2Q4Mjky"><em>"Nina, this is Mika, can you hear me okay?"</em></p>
<p class="cnNkNmM4OTljMDEzNTRiMTVhZWVjODRiNzM5OTQ2ZDM5">Windsong started slightly, finally shaking a bit of snow loose from the tree she'd alighted on. It was still hard responding to her 'real' name...Sarah Janine Klein might legally be her name, but it didn't properly belong to her, because her granny had never had a chance to trade it back to her. Nina was better, but it still didn't feel like her yet. She didn't think it ever would. But she'd promised to at least try to use it.</p>
<p class="cnM4YjRlMTdlNGFmNTQzODVhODA5ZWJlMDg2YWI1YzZm">She still couldn't think of herself as anything other than Windsong, though. Not yet, anyway.</p>
<p class="cnM1YzE4ODU3Njg3YzRmOWFhOTE0ODgzMGJmMjE4MzBm">And her parents didn't understand. They didn't even seem willing to try to understand. When Gabriel and Mika had brought her home to her parents after identifying her and finding them still living on the outskirts of Wheeling, she'd been happy beyond words.</p>
<p class="cnMwNWFiYTA0MWE5OTRjNjliM2M1Y2UzNTQ2M2YxYWJm">It wasn't working out. Not at all.</p>
<p class="cnNiMDg1NGU3ZTBhMTQ3YWI5NmZjN2VkMDg4OTY0MzVi">"I hear ya," she replied. "As clear as if ya were standin' next to me. That's amazin'."</p>
<p class="cnM1OWI3NzQ1NWMwNDQyYTY5ZDE4MmVlODNlYmU1NzFl"><em>"Excellent. I'm really sorry to have dragged you out on a day like this, but I do greatly appreciate your help. You know better than anyone that situations like this are time sensitive."</em></p>
<p class="cnM3NTE1YWQ5YWJhODQ3YTI5YTAyMWQ4ZGRjZWQyNzg5">Windsong huffed and murmured, "That's an understatement of epic proportions." Mika had promised that the microphone pickup on the earbud was sensitive enough to hear her even if she was whispering, and she didn't want to waste her breath or unbalance herself. She also did not add the thought that followed, 'It's better than being at home.'</p>
<p class="cnNiMDQyNGIyNDkxNTQyNTViOGRlMGQ5MzZkNDFjMmFk">Judging by the soft laugh in her left ear, Mika had been telling her the truth about the mic. <em>"I suppose so. Still, it would've taken us a few hours to get our best trackers out here -"</em></p>
<p class="cnM1MmQ3MTk1OGI5MDRkZjhiMjMyY2MxZThiOTRmOTdh">"They can't do what Ah can," Windsong said with absolute certainty, but without any arrogance. It was a statement of fact, of confidence in her skill. "Are ya followin'?"</p>
<p class="cnMyMzc0NmMyYjI4YzRmMzViMDdlMTRhNDNiZmI2YjY4"><em>"You're ahead of me, somehow, but I'm keeping up reasonably well,"</em> Mika said, sounding both amused and impressed. <em>"Are we close?"</em></p>
<p class="cnNmNTE5MDJjYTNkZjQ5MmJhNjdkOGM5ZTVlMDNhNDIw">Windsong lifted her face to the sky and sniffed. "Very. Come on!" Bouncing lightly on her toes, she was back on the treetops and running fast.</p>
<p class="cnM1YmEzNjYzYmM5MzQ3ZTE4OTg5OWYzODBlMzE2YjVj">In seconds, she reached the edge of the woods and leaped lightly from the last tree, landing gracefully atop a flagpole at the edge of the parking lot that was now below her. She paused there, balanced on the ball of one foot, the other tucked in close, her arms extended from her sides slightly.</p>
<p class="cnNkMzdjMmRlY2JmNTQ2YThiYWMzNzhjYTNmYTRjNDUz">Lifting her head a little, she inhaled deeply through her nose and held the breath for a moment before letting it out and taking another the same way. She glanced around, taking in the two-story brick elementary school, the mostly unplowed parking lot, and the gray sky. Then she nodded, and waited, almost completely motionless.</p>
<p class="cnMwMmQ3NjJiNTRjYjQzMWRhOTczMDY3OGJhNDFhNDdl">A few minutes later, a nondescript sedan with tinted windows - which absolutely did not scream 'Fed' - pulled into the parking lot and cruised over. It parked directly below the flagpole.</p>
<p class="cnM1M2UwNmQzMzNhODRkYWRiNmIyNzZkMTExNWZjNGEz">Windsong stepped back just enough for her toes to come off the top of the flagpole. As she began to drop, her left hand and foot shot out and - her palm protected by the cuff of the sweatshirt - caught the pole.</p>
<p class="cnNkMmY1Yzg2N2EyYzQ1ZTQ4YjllYjdlZGI4MTdkYmRk">She slid down it lightly, looping around it twice to slow herself. It also had the result of allowing her to land almost without a sound, facing the sedan.</p>
<p class="cnMxMjZlM2NkNWNhMzQxZTNhMzRiMmM2Njk0YzczODgx">The driver side window on the sedan rolled down, and Mika's voice asked, "Are they here, Nina?"</p>
<p class="cnNkYjdmN2JiODBhOTRmODNiZjA5OTE3NTdhY2M4NzYx">Windsong gave her a thin-lipped smile and nodded. That name just didn't feel at all right. "They're here. Sylphs. On top of the school. Ah can smell 'em in the wind."</p>
<p class="cnNiMzBlOGIxN2MyYzQwMzZhMWYzMDViM2VmNDBlNmRi">The sedan's door opened and Mika stepped out. "What do they smell like?" She asked curiously.</p>
<p class="cnM5MWNjNDk1ZGQ0NDRkZDZhZmMxMDgzNjI5M2RkM2U4">Windsong considered the question for a moment, then pushed back the hood of her sweatshirt to reveal her midnight black hair...no longer long and tied up, now cut in a comfortable, feathered bob. In her bangs, on the right side, she'd dyed a streak of neon blue, and one of neon pink.</p>
<p class="cnM2Y2Q5OWQwODE5NzRlNTJiODEyNTViNTlmOTU3ZWQ2">She took another deep breath through her nose and let it out slowly. "Like the wind before a storm," she said softly. "With touches of..." She took another breath before adding, "Tiger Flower, Dahlia, Lavender, Petunia, and...Canna Lily." She added the last reluctantly, almost with a hint of regret.</p>
<p class="cnNlZDhmMjI2OTVhZjQ5ZmNiNmZkN2ExYzBiMWM4MzE2">"Should I call in the troops?" Mika asked quietly.</p>
<p class="cnNkZDFmMzc4MGFiNDQ5M2M4Mjg0ZWM4MGEwYTI1OWI3">"Nah," Windsong said softly, shaking her head. "This one's personal, I think. Lemme go talk to 'em first."</p>
<p class="cnMwZTk3ZDUyOWVmMTQ1YTM4ZTMxNTU5YWJkMjNjY2Yz">"I'm not entirely comfortable with that," Mika said. "You're only eighteen..."</p>
<p class="cnNhN2ExMzU2MGQ3ODQ0ZTNiNDEwODRiOTI0NjgzYTE2">She trailed off as Windsong gave her a flat look with one raised eyebrow. After a moment, Mika sighed and reluctantly said, "All right. But please be careful, and keep in mind that they probably have a small child up there."</p>
<p class="cnNiYTAzYTBlY2Q5NTQ5YjZiMDg0NmI2M2I2YTZmNTU1">Windsong bounced on her toes a couple of times and trotted toward the school, moving gracefully across the top of the snow and barely leaving any tracks in her wake. She flapped a hand dismissively back in Mika's direction, her voice floating back in her wake. "If Ah'm right, the child's just a lure. Ah got this. Gimme a few minutes."</p>
<p class="cnMxNTUyNjcwNDU2YzQ2MDg5YjE3ZTkyNGZhNzdhZjY0">Without another word, she accelerated across the school's snow-packed lawn, and up the side of the building. Mika noticed that she slowed as she neared the top, one hand shooting out to catch the edge of the roof and pull herself effortlessly the rest of the way up.</p>
<p class="cnMwZjY4OTIyZTUwNTQ3NTk5MGQzMDg5YTlhNTQzZTBl">"That," Mika said softly, "is a really cool trick."</p>
<p class="cnNjOTA5ZjI1ZmNmMjQzNTc4NGIwMDQ3MDk3OWZiZDNm">Atop the roof, Windsong found herself face to face with precisely who she'd expected. Waiting in a semi-circle were five inhumanly beautiful women.</p>
<p class="cnM4YjBmOWZiNjI1NTQzZWZiMDQ4YWZlNTU1MzhmOWFk">They were small, a few inches shorter than Windsong's five-foot-seven, and willowy. Their hair was uniformly short and puffed out like dandelions gone to seed, and colored the palest lavender. They wore diaphanous dresses of some translucent gauzy fabric that was entirely unsuited to the chill weather, and which left their arms entirely bare and barely came to their knees. They were all barefoot.</p>
<p class="cnMyNjRmNzg5ZmJhNzQxYmI4ZGZmMjRjZjEyMDYyYjM3">And they each had two pairs of delicate, transparent wings, like a dragonfly's, but patterned like snowflakes.</p>
<p class="cnMzMWY2NzE2N2QyNTRjOTNiMDI2MmU3OTQ3ODI1MDMx">They weren't identical, but their appearances were similar enough for it to be obvious that they were kin to one another.</p>
<p class="cnNiMWU0NTk2ODMyODQ4MGI5YjQ1Njk5YWE2Yjc1NGJj">Behind them, curled up in the snow on the roof, was a little girl. Not much older, Windsong thought, than she had been when she'd gotten lost in Faerie. The girl wasn't dressed for the weather either, barefoot, and in just sweatpants and a t-shirt. Though she appeared to be asleep, she was visibly shivering.</p>
<p class="cnNjMTljZWNhMzY0MzQ5ZTc4NzM1M2QyYjVmOTQ1OGE0">"Sisters," the one in the center of the semi-circle said in a voice that sounded like the wind whistling through the trees, "our quarry has come."</p>
<p class="cnM2OTk0Mzc5MTU1NjRjNTU4YWI5MmFlNzg4Y2FlYjUw">"I told you she would," the one on the far right said, sounding - and looking - rather sullen. "I told you the child would be -"</p>
<p class="cnNhZDM2NzY2NzIzZTRjYTliMTc2OWUyODc2MWZkZWY3">"Be silent," the one in the center hissed.</p>
<p class="cnM5Y2YyZDFjNzVmMjQ3NWNiY2NhNWM3NTNlOGExNGIw">Windsong clasped her hands behind her back. "How about ya let me take the child somewhere warm, then Ah'll come back and talk. Y'all have my word."</p>
<p class="cnMwN2VkYjhmM2NmZjQ2NDJhZmRmNDU3OGYzMGQxYjQ5">"The child is ours by right," the one in the center said, "payment from the Queen of Air and Darkness for delivering her message to you." She extended one hand toward Windsong and said grandly, "Our Lady offers you amnesty and sanctuary. In return, you will serve her willingly, as you did your Godmother, for a period of no less than ten years."</p>
<p class="cnMzYzIxZmM0OGVkYTQ4NWU4YzNiMTBmOGEwZTJkMWMy">Windsong tipped her head, her eyebrows drawing down and in as she frowned. "Amnesty? What for?"</p>
<p class="cnNkZjk2OTQ3OTAyZTRjMTk4ZWM0MzYzOGE0NzJiODBi">"As your Godmother's declared apprentice," the sylph in the center said, "you are held guilty of her actions as if they were your own. Come home, serve the Queen of the Unseelie Court, and all will be forgiven!"</p>
<p class="cnNmZmFjYWYzZTYyYjQ3MzBiNmI3MDFkZGE1OTlhYTI2">Windsong stared at the sylph with open incredulity and scorn. "Y'all outta your minds? Okay, first off, only a half-wit would accept terms as vague as 'a period no less than ten years.'" She rocked on her feet slightly, spreading them slowly to give herself a better center of balance. "Second, y'all know full well apprentices ain't held responsible for the actions o'their masters. Ah was actin' on her behalf, which makes me just a tool of her actions...by the Queen's own decree when she came for Granny for havin' me do it."</p>
<p class="cnNkYzJkMmNmOGUzNDQ2ZGY5ZmFlNzIzNzY2ZDgyOTEx">She saw the sylph off to her right - the sullen one - begin to slowly back away from her sisters.</p>
<p class="cnNmZGE2MWE5N2ZiZTQwZjdiZmYyYTMwZGU3NGY5ZjZm">"Finally," she said, "Granny made me promise long ago that I'd never join either Court." She smirked. "And y'all can't make me."</p>
<p class="cnMwYzFhYjIyNDY5MTQ0MGNiMTI0NGRjMzVmMDg2MWU2">"Sisters, we did as we were bid," the sylph in the center said dismissively. "She has rejected our Queen's offer, and so we may instead claim the bounty." She grinned widely, displaying a mouth full of very sharp teeth. "Let us feast. The child will make a delicious desserk-"</p>
<p class="cnMyMTFmOTA4MGUxZTQxZjRiYzFmZjM4MjNiNmQ2NTMy">Her final word was cut off as the leather-wrapped hilt of one of Windsong's dagger's appeared in her throat. Her neck was so slender that the tip of the aqua blue crystal blade protruded visibly from the back. Windsong gave a piercing whistle, and the dagger vanished from the sylph's throat before she dropped bonelessly to the roof, too-pale blood streaming from both sides of the fatal wound.</p>
<p class="cnM2OTUwYjI4NmY5YzQ2YmNiYTI2YTc4ZTQ3OWY0MDY1">The dagger, meanwhile, had reappeared in Windsong's right hand, and she now held a matching one in her left.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZGViNWQwNjU2MzRmNzY4YWQ5NjE1MWZmMDUwZGU5">Windsong settled into a fighting stance and smiled politely without showing her teeth. "Ah'm not on the menu, silly fairies. The kid ain't neither." She tightened her grip on the daggers, their blades suddenly crackling with electricity.</p>
<p class="cnMwOTk2NzkzODE3YjRiZDk4ZmIwYTdkOTRhNjQwZGU2">The fairies comment seemed to enrage the sylphs, and three of the remaining four - leaving out only the one who had been backing slowly away - charged her. Their wings buzzed angrily, and their feet never touched the roof as they blurred toward her.</p>
<p class="cnNhMjhhZTlkYWEwMzQwOWNiYjYzNzRlMDQyZWU1Mzk3">It was over in moments, too fast for the eye to follow. Three sylphs lay dead on the roof, throats stabbed or slashed, bits of sliced wing and gauze from their gowns drifting in the air.</p>
<p class="cnNmYTBiYjc4ZDgzNDQ1YTVhOWQ5ZWE5YjI5ODhjNTc4">Windsong wiped a bit of blood from her cheek where one of the sylphs had managed to graze her with a claw, and turned on the remaining one. "You up next, Canna Lily?" She asked quietly. "Thought we had an understandin', you and me."</p>
<p class="cnM0YTAyNzIyNzc5ZjQ5NjliYmUyOTVlNmI4NzhkZjI0">"We do!" The remaining sylph said quickly, holding her hands out in front of her defensively. "I came only because my sisters made me."</p>
<p class="cnMyNGMxMjBiYmMxMDRjZDBhY2EyNjFlNDM3YzU5OGJk">"Sounded t'me like you came up with stealin' the child away from her parents," Windsong said darkly.</p>
<p class="cnNiNTNlZTAxZTFmODRjY2RhMzc3NGVjNzIzZDAxNzcw">"I knew a missing child would get your attention!" Canna said quickly. "I meant her no harm. Even now she merely sleeps!"</p>
<p class="cnMyZGFkODE4Y2Y4ODRkYTNhNjA4YTk5MDVmYTcwODEz">Windsong huffed. "We made a few good deals, you and me. One more for old time's sake: Ah let you live and leave, you tell me what you know about this mess."</p>
<p class="cnNhYjEwNWIyYmJmNjQ5NjRhYzcwYzE5NjhjMjA4NDQy">"Deal!" The sylph said quickly. "The Queen of Air and Darkness was unable to acquire the exclusive services of your godmother while she was alive, and desires yours in her place. So she put a bounty on your head. If she can't have your services, she means for nobody to."</p>
<p class="cnNhYzQzZGZmMzNmZjRjOWFiYzM2N2E1ZTk1NWI1ODNi">Windsong groaned and rolled her head back, letting her daggers dangle a little. "Goddamn fairies..." She gave the daggers a flick, and the pale sylph blood staining them spattered the snow around her, leaving them clean. She slid them up under the back of her sweatshirt, and her hands returned empty.</p>
<p class="cnNhODA0ODFhZjY0NTRiOGRiODhhMmI0ZDY3NjI3Mzky">After a moment of silence, the sylph said, "You cut your hair. It looks nice."</p>
<p class="cnNmNzMyOWRkYjhhMDQ2MWE5MjkxMjg4ZDAzZWFmNWE4">Windsong shrugged. "That giant mane Ah'd grown was a pain in my backside. And my neck." She ran her fingers through her short, feathered hair, and it fell right back into place. "This is much easier." She flashed a brief, closed-lipped smile. "You'd've laughed watchin' me convincin' the stylist Ah was takin' all of the cut hair with me. Burned it all that evening."</p>
<p class="cnM1NTMzNjk1MmMzYTRmZTdhZmFlMWVjZmNkOTFmYTJk">The sylph nodded, and they fell silent again. Finally, Windsong sighed and said, "Go home, Canna Lily."</p>
<p class="cnM2ZGZjMGM4MWQzZDQxNjFhNTBkYmFiYjRjYjNiZGQ5">"One more deal!" The sylph said eagerly, taking a couple of fluttering steps forward. "Show me again the secret of stealing someone's breath, and I will tell all of Faerie that you are too dangerous to approach."</p>
<p class="cnMwYmIwNGZmMTliNDQxNTQ5OWU0MGM3ZmQzMGY3ZjBl">Windsong considered that for a moment, then smiled and laughed. "Deal. C'mere."</p>

<p class="cnM2N2I1YTM0YTMzNDQzNGE4ZDhlZjkwNmUzNzNjMzI4"><strong> </strong></p>
<p class="cnM1ZDYyM2E1OGFhODRmZjg5OGQzNTZkZDJmNTlmMjE0">Ten minutes later, Windsong hopped lightly down from the root of the school, the still-sleeping little girl cradled in her arms. Mika bundled the girl up in a couple of blankets, tucked her in the back seat of her sedan, and looked at Windsong. "I'm going to take her to the police station. If you aren't in a hurry, could we talk after that?"</p>
<p class="cnMxOGVkMmE0YTIxMTRlY2FiYmE1ZTBjYmViOTA1OGMx">Windsong sighed and nodded. "Ah guess we'd better."</p>
<p class="cnNjMzU0ZWEwZjBiMjQ0YzdhZjE5N2M5MGE1OTljZjUz">She stayed in Mika's car with the heater turned up, not wanting to be involved with returning the child to her parents. It was almost three hours later when Mika pulled the car into driveway of the home owned by Windsong's parents, parked, and turned to look at the younger girl.</p>
<p class="cnNiODIzODlkZjZiODRiYzc4OWZhYTY4NWMwMWI3OTRi">Windsong sat in the passenger seat, arms crossed, staring at the dashboard.</p>
<p class="cnM4YjQ5MmJiOWJlNTRiYmI5MTVhMDIzNzliNDBmODJm">"Tell me?" Mika asked.</p>
<p class="cnMxYjYxZDFkMTEwYzQ4MjA5ZmIwYjJkOTg3MGQ5NjVk">Windsong nodded slowly, then told Mika about her encounter with the sylphs. As she wound down, Mika gave her a concerned look. "Do I want to know how you know the secret of stealing someone's breath?"</p>
<p class="cnNjYmQyNTgzMzUwNTQ2NjZhOTIyZDc3N2RiNTEwYTli">Windsong blinked a few times, then started laughing softly. "It's not what ya think, honest. Not even close. Ah've known Canna Lily for a few years now. She's every bit as dangerous as any other sylph, but she's that sylph I told ya about back in October...the youngest of five sisters?</p>
<p class="cnMyZTQyMzdiMzRlODQ2MmU5Zjg4ZDZjZGMxZjc4YzFh">When Mika nodded her recognition, she said, "Her older sisters gave her a really hard time, not teachin' her everything, so she and Ah made a few deals...stuff my granny had taught me for things only sylphs know."</p>
<p class="cnM1NTgwMjk3ZjI2ZjQxOTE5M2VhODk1MTFkMWMwZWUw">Still smiling a little, Windsong continued. "Couple years ago, Canna was super frustrated that her sisters wouldn't teach her the secret of stealing someone's breath, so Ah made a deal with her...Ah'd teach her, in exchange for her teaching me the sylphs' secret for treadin' lightly."</p>
<p class="cnNkZGQzYjU5YmNjYTQxOTY4OGU2OGYzNzRiMWVlMGFh">"And...you know that secret?" Mika asked uneasily.</p>
<p class="cnNlZGNjMTVhMDE3MjQwM2FiNWRjZDZkMGI1OWI0YWQ5">"In a manner'a speakin'." Windsong gave her a sly, amused smile. "She taught me the secret...which is basically all about not stayin' in one place long enough for whatever you're standin' on to notice you're there, like half a heartbeat is all, and believin' you belong where ya are."</p>
<p class="cnM2YzkzYzI4MzMzYjRkYTc5YzMwNTQ0ZTk2MGZjYmE0">"And you...?" Mika asked.</p>
<p class="cnM5NjhkZjBkODA1ZDRjNjFhNTU0NjkwMzBhZWViOGQw">"Kissed the heck out of her," Windsong said, and giggled. "Ah mean, full on lip-lock and go to town. First time Ah'd ever kissed anyone like that, so Ah gave it my all. Left her stunned and breathless. Left myself a little breathless, too."</p>
<p class="cnM3YTM5NTczNGRkMDQ1ZmViZTVkNzcyOTM3NGNkZWJh">Mika stared at her, then started laughing with her. "I...I bet she wasn't happy..."</p>
<p class="cnNmMDBkMzlmYjQwZjRjMTBiZGU4ZTJhMjBmNmFiMDA1">"She looked right annoyed," Windsong agreed. "But she never protested that Ah'd broken the deal."</p>
<p class="cnM1NWE4ZTkxZGZmYTQ1YmI4OWY3MjdlYWY1OWUyZmI5">"And came back for seconds," Mika noted.</p>
<p class="cnNjNTVhZjI2ODRiZjRiNWZiZGVkNGFmYjkyMzBmODE1">"And that," Windsong nodded.</p>
<p class="cnM5ODQwYmM4MGE4YzQ2ZDQ4MDJjY2NkZWI0YmZhOGZl">They both fell silent. Finally, Mika asked quietly, "How're things here at home?"</p>
<p class="cnNmMWZlYzJhNWFmNDQ5M2U5YzRkMzZmMDBkNWNhYmEy">"Not good," Windsong admitted just as quietly. "My mom and dad...they lost their six year-old daughter thirty-two years ago, and got back an eighteen year-old girl they barely recognize, and who's too weird for them to handle most of the time. They don't wanna hear about my life in Faerie, and my frame of reference for mortal life is warped."</p>
<p class="cnM4OTQwOTQyMDU3OTQ5NzI4ZWMzMmZhN2I0ZGY3MmU1">She sighed. "And now the freakin' Queen of the Winter Court has it out for me. I need a patron who'll make her chill the heck out." She looked at Mika. "When y'all brought me home, after I came out in Central Park, y'said your organization could use people like me."</p>
<p class="cnM3YmI4Y2Q5MmIzYzQzZmY5ODRlOTg5MTc4MzY2NDhk">Mika nodded. "The offer stands. You'd have to get your GED, but we'd be happy to help you acclimate to living on Earth again. And you definitely have skills that would be valuable to us."</p>
<p class="cnM2YWI1MmI1NjY3MTRiZTg4ZmUzYjhkYTFkM2JjODRk">"I'm not gonna be like my Granny," Windsong said firmly. "Ah know she was some big neutral hitter in Faerie, available for hire to both Courts, but Ah don't wanna be a killer for hire no more."</p>
<p class="cnM1NzM3MmQ2Njk5ZTQzYzViYzZkMTkwMjc5M2UyMzg1">"You just killed four sylphs to save a little girl," Mika noted.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZDhmNWEyNDE1NTQ0ZjE5MTM5MTBhOTM4MjY2YzAx">Windsong shrugged. "Sylphs are goddamn dangerous if y'let 'em get up a head of steam. It was safer to hit 'em hard and fast, before they blew up a gale. And Ah was hopin' that my history with Canna would keep her from helpin' her sisters."</p>
<p class="cnMwZDE4ODI3ZTRlNjRhYmE5OTU2ZDQxOTdiZDU4ZWMw">"A gamble that paid off," Mika observed. "She's going back to Faerie to tell everyone just how dangerous you are, and all it cost you was a kiss?"</p>
<p class="cnM2MjE2YjQyNzNlOTQxN2Q5NzYzZmQ0MmEyOTlmYjIz">"I believe the Brits would call what we did 'havin' a snog,'" Windsong said dryly, then snorted a little laugh. "But yeah, it was a good deal. I doubt anyone'll really listen to her, but she'll give it her best."</p>
<p class="cnNmZWI4MDAwNjk5ZDRmZWFhMDNiN2ViNDM5OGY0ZGU2">She looked at Mika. "How much clout does your bunch have in Faerie?"</p>
<p class="cnNiMGE3YzZiMDc5NTRhZjI4YWY4NmU5M2M2OTBkYTZm">Mika smiled slightly. "Enough that the Unseelie Court should back off hunting you if you join us. At least, if you stay out of their territory. I imagine they might take trespassing as cause for renewed grievance."</p>
<p class="cnMxZWNlYjU4YzFiYTQ4MWJiNzQzNTAyMGRhZDA5MzM5">"What'll joining you cost me?" Windsong asked pointedly. "What's the deal?"</p>
<p class="cnM4N2Y0ZGUxNzVmMTQ2ZWNhZWY4OGEwM2QzM2ZkZDBh">Mika shook her head. "We're not Sidhe, Nina. But if you feel a compelling need to bargain, you can trade us some of your very unique knowledge of Faerie and the Sidhe in exchange for our protection and help re-integrating into the world."</p>
<p class="cnNlZjEyYmI0MjViZDQ1NDNhNGRiMTZhNWJiMDlmNzNl">Windsong considered that for a moment, then nodded and offered Mika her hand. "That sounds all right."</p>
<p class="cnM4YWMzODI0YzcxYTQ1YTU5Yzc2NTMwOGQxM2E0ZWI4">Mika shook her hand firmly. "Excellent. When would you like to start?"</p>
<p class="cnNjNTJmMDBjZjNhMTRmYzJiZWYwNTkwMGVjOGE4NzJl">"Not like Ah got much holdin' me here." Windsong made a little sound in her throat.</p>
<p class="cnM4Mjg4NTExYTQ5MDQyZDI5ZTRlYzkwYjg0ZWM1MWEx">Mika reached over and squeezed Nina's shoulder gently. "Are you sure? If you give them more time, maybe -"</p>
<p class="cnNlMjhiNjNiMDg4MzRiNGRiYzUxMTQ5YzZiZjUxZmZi">Windsong shook her head firmly. "They're...distant fragments of memory for me. And Ah'm not their daughter anymore. Not the one they want back, anyway. Hell, my name ain't even mine anymore. 'Nina' don't feel right to me neither, more like more of a placeholder. 'Windsong'...at least that's mine by right."</p>
<p class="cnM4Mjc0YTEwNDYyNDQ1OTU5ZWNiNzM2MGE4YmQ0Y2Y4">Mika squeezed gently again. "Then I suggest a course of moving forward and building a new life. We can even get you a new legal name."</p>
<p class="cnM0NTZmMDI5ZTk4MTQwYTM5MmZjNzZmNmU2MGJmNjRl">"Always had a fondness for Katherine. Or Jessica. Maybe both." Windsong nodded firmly. "Granny always said idle hands are the Sluagh's playground. Better to be doin' somethin' than sittin' on my hands here tryin' to be someone Ah ain't."</p>
<p class="cnM4ZjNlOGIwNDYyMzQzMDY5ZWFhNjBjMWJmNTZjZTdh">"Wise words," Mika observed. "How about a surname?"</p>
<p class="cnM1OWYwOTI0ZWQ1MTQ5NGE4N2E3YzkzZWQ2MGU1NWYy">Windsong shook her head. "Dunno. Why?"</p>
<p class="cnM1MzJmZTAxYTM1YTRlNDliYzY4YWI5NTNjZmRjZWZi">"I was thinking Rhodes might suit you well," Mika said.</p>
<p class="cnM4MTA3YmIzZTgxMjRlYjc5ODliOGZhYWI1NjgxMGQ2">"Roads? Like...Country Roads?"</p>
<p class="cnNlNTY0MDNhZDE1YjRjZGRhNTliN2EwNWFiYjBhYzhk">Mika smiled. "Spelled a little differently, but yeah."</p>
<p class="cnNkZDhkZjBlNGQ0MzQ1OTM4YTM5NmI5OTc1NjFmMTUx">"I like it. Jessica Katherine? Nah, Katherine Jessica Rhodes. Y'all can call me Kate or Jessie." Windsong smiled, and it felt genuine to her for the first time in weeks. "All right, lemme just run inside and grab a couple things, and let my parents know where Ah'm goin'. Then we can go. And Ah can start my new life," she added.</p>
<p class="cnNlMzlmYzEyZDcxNjRjMDdhODQzNzUzMmU0NDRmMWUy">Then she smiled a bit more. "Maybe some diction lessons ta break some of Granny's bad habits? Ah saw Gabriel wince every time I say 'ain't.'"</p>
<p class="cnM0N2Y3MmQxYmNiMDRmMWY4ZmZhYjdmMGUzM2Q1OWY0">"A good reason to keep doing it," Mika said with a smile. "But we can talk about it anyway. Go get what you need, and I'll take you home."</p>
<p class="cnM0MTIxZmY1NDM0NzQzNzk4ZTI3MWFmNzRkNmZhMDM2">"Home," Windsong - mentally she tried out 'Jessie' and found it felt very natural - said softly. "Yeah, Ah'll find that someday. For now, the UNSDI'll do me just fine." She opened her door and climbed out. "Don't you go nowhere 'till I get back."</p>
<p class="cnMwMmM2YTQyNjc0NzRlZTlhMzA5NzE0ZmI1OWZkYzE5">"I'll be right here waiting for you," Mika said firmly.</p>
