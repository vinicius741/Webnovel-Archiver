<p class="cnNkMWRkNjdkZWRhOTRjMTY5N2RmODBjZWFhMTAzYWY4"><span style="font-weight: 400">The two human children kissed. Between sobbing, smiling, and crying, their emotions clashed, as the will of one was imposed on the other. In this unnatural night, caused by the ruthless plan of three despicable people, they were each other’s entire world.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZjA3MmJhNGRmMTRlNTU4OWFhMjY0MmFjODY1N2Vm"><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl, the much shorter of the two, had stretched as far as her small body let her. They both closed their eyes for the kiss that seemed to last an eternity. Only the feeling of each other’s lips mattered.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YjU2MzFmN2M0ZDQ2NTQ4OWE4YmUyY2I4OGQ5ZDQ0"><span style="font-weight: 400">But that eternity didn’t last forever—no, it </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">couldn’t</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> last forever. After it passed, the boy vanished into thin air, still holding the kiss. If the onlookers were anybody else, they might have been astounded by his sudden disappearance. But they weren’t just anyone—they were the two angels who got tangled in those events by the sheer force of nature called Ayumi.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNzM2Njk4ZjRmYjQzN2JhNDYyYTRmZDFkYmQwNGMx"><span style="font-weight: 400">After Takeya vanished, the girl returned her soles to the ground and stood still for a few seconds. As a slight flush rose on her face, she turned to the two observers, who both felt they had been accidentally peeping.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYzZhZWE5MjlmYTQyYjViZmRmYjBmZjU4ZDg3ZTMy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah-ah-ah, that sure was embarrassing!” The girl said, her cheeks wet with tears and face flushed bright red. She began furiously drying her tears with her uniform’s oversized sleeves.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNTI2N2M5ZDM0ODQzNzQ4Njk5NjczNDdiNjM2NDFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where did you send Takeya?” Hikari, still looking like “Kotori”, asked, trying to bring Ayumi back to reality.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMzQ2ZDFlZGI0MjRmMDJiYTgyMWEwY2E1ZjEzZTNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“To his bedroom. I couldn’t… I just couldn’t keep him here after all that, you know?” She said, her tears finally drying up.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZGY1NDcxNWM1NDQ5ZDM5YmY0MDFjYzEzNTY2NDBj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes… good move,” the angel responded with a smile. Even she seemed stump on what to say.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMmQ0ZjA2YmJiYzQwMWY5M2NmZjQzZDljMTdmZmIy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyway, enough of this. We have more important things to focus on now,” Ayumi said after a sigh. “Time is running out. There are a lot of things I have to explain, and even more I have to do before Gaia goes kaput.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZTZkMGEyMGY1ZjQyMTFhMTU2Mjc4ODc4N2I3YTYx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And I have a lot of questions for you as well,” Hikari said. “First, what exactly is going to happen to us? To this world, Gaia? Your explanation was pretty vague before.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjkzMjNmZmZjMDQzNjA5ZDU3NTkxODhmZTMwODQ2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wanted to explain things further, but Takkun kinda derailed the conversation a bit there, ah-ah.” Ayumi scratched her still wet cheek, and then put on a more serious face. “Now that he’s gone, you girls deserve an explanation. Since, well, you’re the ones that are going to have to deal with the consequences.” She breathed in heavily and began her explanation. “Basically, Gaia as it currently exists is going to have its firmware updated. That’s an unavoidable fate at this point.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Mjk1MTM4N2Q5YTQ2NTdhNWY0ZjY4NjM2NTQ5N2U4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“B-but didn’t you mention… you were going to save Gaia using a b-backup?” Shiina asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMGRmNGQ5ZWI1YjQ5MTFhNjY3OGM2NGE5Y2E5YThm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I did. But… I might have forgotten to mention a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">little</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> detail before.” Then, she raised her hand with two fingers up. “From now on, there will be </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">two</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Gaias.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNjdhNzFjM2IwOTQ1M2ZhM2UzYzVlMGU1MTY2MGU4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait, two?!” Hikari was stunned, even if she had already experienced her fair share of shocking revelations that evening.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NjliZGM1MTRhODQxMTA4MjFkNWY4ZWY4MGM4Yzk3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“For the sake of simplicity, let’s use their version numbers. The Gaia we’re currently on is version one-point-something-or-other. Let’s call it ‘Old Gaia’. This is the Gaia that has angels. The new firmware will update the firmware to version 2.0. That’s ‘New Gaia’. And this Gaia will replace angels with a new AI system.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYTE3ZjFlZTQ3NzQyNTM4MGRkYmRhNzI5ODYxNTEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That much I can follow.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMGQ3MzI3ZDgyZjQ1MDFhMzVhYjM4YmRiY2Q4NDg5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, what is supposed to happen is that Old Gaia will smoothly transition to New Gaia, all faults get fixed, and all angels are deleted in the process. That’s what we want to avoid. So what my collaborators and I did was install the most recent backup of Old Gaia somewhere else. Transferring your guys’ memories over there, of course. That way, we can keep both versions running.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZjQ1NDlmMWViYzQ0YjliMWZhZTM3ZjM5NzRkNWI3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait… what? Can you just… do that?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YzgyMWRmMTc5OTQwOGI4MGQ3ZjIwZmU1MjJlYmZh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is it that surprising? It’s just like moving a website from one hosting server to another. Although Gaia is pretty big, so I get your concern.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZTYxODZkMmRmZDQwZGU5MzI1NzE1ZWJlODAzMDVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-That’s not the issue,” Shiina uncharacteristically intervened. “Gaia is an entire world, right? How can you just… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">copy</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> it?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NGJhZjg3ZmE3MzQ1Y2U4MThlYWI2Yjk1NjI2NGQx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, it’s nothing special! I don’t have time to get into the nitty-gritty details now. But well, imagine it’s some super futuristic technology, and you aren’t very far.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkODA2NmUzODVjYjRhYmRhZDFhMmE0YzQ3MzMzYzMw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-No, I didn’t mean that…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYTkzN2E2ODcyYTQ3MjZiOWQ0ZGQzOGExOTU4YTU0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina seemed to be tangled in her own words, so the angel took over. “I believe what Shiina means is more conceptual. As in… are you allowed to do that? Clone an entire world and just install it somewhere else. Does that not mean… cloning people?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNjliODg1Yjc4ZDRhMjI4ZTFlNDI0YTI4OTVlYjI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, so that’s what you meant.” There was an uncharacteristically long pause before Ayumi answered. “To be blunt—no, we can’t do that. What we’re going to do is </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">super</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> illegal. If people find out, we’ll be in some hotter-than-the-sun water. But… that’s preferable to the alternative, that is, all of you dying. Don’t you agree?” Both women agree there was no point in replying. “And no one should find out until it’s too late to do anything about it. Probably. Hopefully.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMjg1NDk3OTlkNDQyZTFhM2FjMDgzY2Q2YzNkN2Rk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-That’s doesn’t sound reassuring…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDIzMzFmMjc0MjQwMmE4OTIyZmY0ODBhYmJkYjE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Trust me on this, Shiina! It’ll </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">allll</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> be just fine!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MjIwZmM0ZDJjOTRlYTE4YmQzOTVlOWVlMjhmYzRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“But why the need to keep two versions running at the same time?” Hikari asked. “Could you not stop simulating the entire world until you get everything sorted out?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMmEzOTQ3ZDllMjQ0NmE5NzhmMDQyMDA2NWFhOWI5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s… not that simple,” Ayumi said sorrowfully. “There are a lot of Divers who make their entire lives inside Gaia. They all have connections with powerful people with a lot of resources. They pay a lot of money for the privilege… and most of them, just like the archangels, don’t care one way or another what happens to angels, beings they don’t even know exist. If we brought this entire scandal to light, the powerful lobbies behind them would do whatever they could to quash the whole thing. It’s a lost cause. There’s no way to save you other than cloning.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNjc0NDM4Yjk5YzRlMDI4NzcwMzIyMDJhNWQyMDU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hikari shrugged. “Well, if it keeps us safe… then who am I to complain.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNzYxNGU0ZTQ3MjQ3OTY5YTI3OTRmZWYyNWE1MmQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right! That’s the attitude I wanted to see!” Ayumi said with a forced smile. “Speaking of safety, though, there’s… huh… something else I need to warn you about.” Both Shiina and Hikari made a face like if they had just bitten into a particularly sour lemon. “Old Gaia was isolated from the rest of the network. But we have to install the backup on an existing network. Imagine you are going from a local Ethernet server to the World Wide Web.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMjhmYWI2MTNjNTRmNmFiZDcyMWRmMTU4MjlkYWRj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hikari didn’t understand a single word Ayumi said, and it seemed Shiina, too, was equally confused. The human girl apparently caught on to that, though.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZTcwYTcwZTRkMjQ1NzI5ZDEwMDYzNTc1ZTc0ZTNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Was that too confusing? Well, don’t worry about it. It’s basically like hiding a tree—even if it’s a very big tree—in a forest.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MmFjYzc1YWZiOTQwYWQ5MDBjN2RkYTJlY2IwOTJk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And… what exactly does that mean? Why would any of that be unsafe?” Hikari questioned, almost fearfully.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZDBjYzg0YjZjMjRjZWVhMWViNTE1YmE1ZmRmNTI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It basically means your closed garden will end. People from outside and from other worlds will have access to Gaia, if they know where to look. And in return, you’ll have access to the rest of the network as well.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZjIwNzI3N2E0ODRkMzhhZGIxMjYzM2U1YzdkNzgw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina’s mind—already on the brink because of all the revelations so far—had now officially been blown.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlN2RmNjBmZDdhMDQ2ZGU4Njc2ZGU3OTNhYzJlNWQ1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hikari, on the other hand, was positively astonished. “There are other worlds?! You did not mention anything about this before!”</span></p><span class="cjI4ZGQzOGI0NmY2YzRiYjM4ZGU4N2JkNGNkNmEwMDg2"><br/>If you discover this tale on Amazon, be aware that it has been unlawfully taken from Royal Road. Please report it.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM1MWVmZmQxZWQyMjQzNzZiNzRlMTc1ZGRjNTViYWFh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I thought it was too much to handle back then! Can you blame me? And don’t angels already believe something similar to this? Is it that much of a shock?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZWE3NmJmMTI4ZDQyYmNhOWFkNzMxZjZmY2QwNzY2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It is! In our scripture, there’s no way to i-interact with other worlds. But if what you’re saying is true… Are we going to have people from elsewhere invading Gaia? This… this is a n-nightmare…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MGEyM2VjNzNiYjRhY2RiY2Q0NzVmODliZTc1NmZk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Relax, Shiina. I said there will be access to Gaia, but it isn’t that simple. Just like with the current system, they’ll need permission to enter Gaia or else break in themselves. They’ll have to find Gaia anyway, which will not be easy considering we’re telling no one where it is. Stumbling into Gaia by chance will be rare, and an even rarer occurrence will be someone trying to enter. And even if they do, the system won’t allow them in. You guys are pretty safe. It’s like trying to find a website without knowing its domain, and even then it’s password protected.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4M2ZhNzUxMThmNDQ5N2NhYTExMTkwNWM2MjRlOWY1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hikari couldn’t hide her confusion. “...Huh.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYmQ5ZTg0MTFhYzRkYjM5MDRlMjkwNTczMGNjMmNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, I forgot. The computer analogies don’t work. Well, don’t worry too much about it, but stay vigilant. There might be some incidents.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Y2U0ZWE2YzU5ZTQ2MmVhM2RlZDk3NGNjZWNhZjRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MzM3NTUwZGQzOTQyMzU4MWQxMDg5NjAxODNhODRk"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">That does not sound very reassuring,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Hikari thought.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4N2ExZGMyNDE1ZTRmODc4N2JjOWVkZWY5NzkwZWNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So w-what’s going to happen to us? To all the angels, and the Upper Realm?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmODQ5NTBjNjZlZTRjNDY4NTE5OWQwMGFkMGM4Mjgz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmmm… honestly, I haven’t thought that far ahead yet.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OWY0NjgzZTIxMTQyNmY4YTk5NDA1YjQ5MmZjN2Qy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You haven’t?!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNmMzYzU2YTIzMDRjZDJhOTNjZTY1ZGI4MWM1OTU5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hikari could only bring a hand to her forehead.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NWRiNmU0N2M3OTQ2ODU5OTY4MjcwMTFmZTgwYWM0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was rather more worried about actually getting inside Gaia and getting rid of those cockroaches.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlN2FkYTQ3ODdhNjQzNTY4ZGJlMmU5YzZmMzE3MTQw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That is understandable… however, this is our home you are talking about. I hope you can see our side of the situation too.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmM2M1NDc3OGIxMzQ2OGViOTFlZGQ2YWIyZDBmZGQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right, of course! Well, here’s some good news then! You probably don’t have to worry about glitches anymore!” Despite Ayumi’s enthusiasm, the only feeling the angels had was dread. Even she could tell from their faces. “H-Huh? I thought you two would be happy about this!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYTdiOWU4NmY1MTRmMzhiNTEyNWE5NjZiNzE1NjNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it is good news, but…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OGQ5ZDk4N2ZmMzRhMTdhMmU5NmI4YzdiMjM1OThl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Strangely, it was Shiina who voiced her concerns. “If w-we aren’t getting directives from God anymore, and faults aren’t happening either… what are we supposed to do now?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYWM0NGVkNDU4MjQ5Mjk5ZGVjNzRjZDRhNWQzODEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh…” It seems the problem had just hit Ayumi. “Those two are your entire reason for existing, after all. Shoot, I should have thought about this more…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYTUyMTViOTA3MzQxMGNhYmVhY2M4ZGUwNDg0NmQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, you really should have.” Hikari sighed. “You truly never change, Ayumi.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNTU1NDBlYzlmNjQwMjJhMTYyNGFlYjBiZmNiNzM3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Man, hearing that coming from a former classmate of mine is </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">sooo </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">uncanny.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZmFmYzdhZWZmMTRmNGJhN2IwMjVjODk2Y2Y4Njdk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hikari put on her best teenage girl smile, although it was a bit strained. “Eh-eh. I try my best!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYWY0YzJiNTcwMDRlNmZiMTEyMGE1ODA1NmU3MGJk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“But anyway, let’s think about this. Angels have nothing to do now. You two will keep your memories to deal with those outside dangers.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZjY5NzE0Mjc2MjQ2MmU4OTU3YjAzMGZhNmE3OTYx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And there is yet another issue,” Hikari began, both girls looking at her. “Now that the old archangels are gone, there is a leadership vacuum to contend with.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMzZmOTc4YWVkNjQxMGFhNDMyYWNiNzM0NmJmMjZk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re right… I hadn’t thought of that, either.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNDg1NDk2Mjc5MDQ0MTZhNGZmMDFmNDA4YWIwNGE3"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Did she think about </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">anything</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">?!</span></em></p>
<p class="cnM0MDQwZDlhZjIyNTRkMzg5Y2UwNWEyNTg5MjRlYTFm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, Ayumi snapped her fingers. “Oh, I know what to do!” Then, she smiled broadly. “I can’t do the same thing I’m going to do to Takkun for keeping your memories, but I can just turn you two into archangels and solve </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">two</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> of those problems!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZGU4MWVhYzUxZDRhNGRiYzJkNTE0M2NiNTMzOWU0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I… huh?!” Hikari didn’t seem to comprehend what Ayumi had just said. Meanwhile, Shiina was just flabbergasted.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NzU0MGNkNzc1MDRlYTFiNWQxZGM2ZmE0MTBlMzRj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You see, since archangels are always supposed to be Divers too, they must keep their memories even in the event of a world reset.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZGRlNGJmMTgzMTQ4NTM4OTg1YmUyYjc0ZDNjMjI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That is not the problem here! Me, an archangel?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDBlMmYzZjAwMzQ5ZWRhM2ZiNTMwMjBhNmI0OTli"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? What’s the problem?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOTgwMGIxMGEyNTQ4MDk4OWU1YWE0OTRiY2ViNDRl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I…” Hikari turned her head away. “I’m not sure if I’m the right person for the job.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYjIwMmY1ODgxMzQzODViYWM1NjMxZjU4YTJlNGFm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, this would just be a temporary fix to prevent everything from falling into chaos. You can just pick someone else later to take on a more permanent position. That said, archangels will need to know about the truth if they are to operate effectively in these new times.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZTE3MGUyOTJkYzRiODQ4NGYwMGFlZjU4YjZmNmNk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I suppose we could do that.” Then, the angel sighed. “I supposed that is the best way out of our predicament.” Then, she turned to her former sister-in-arms. “And what about you, Shiina?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZmY1MWU1YmUxMDQzYjg4ODBlZTk5MTc3OGYyMjQz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“M-Me?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NzJmNjQ1YzI5YTQ5MWRiOTUzMmNkM2QwYzgzNTgw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, under this plan, you too would be turned into an archangel.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZjEwZDE1MGFmZDRhNjNhOWNhNGFmZjhlNjY0NWUz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“R-right, of course. B-But… I don’t think I’m the right person to be an archangel, either.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MzBjYWM5NzE3MjRjZDdhOWViMWU5ZTM2YTI3ZWQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, you don’t </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">have</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to actually do any of the managerial work yourself. You could just be an archangel in title only. In your case, this is a way to prevent you from losing your memories.” Ayumi paused. “Unless you </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">want</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to lose your memories.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MjhjMDcxNGE5NDQwMTY5YWJlMTlkZTcwODNlZmY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-Wait a second.” Shiina had only now begun to process the magnitude of their situation. “So no one other than us will remember the Illumination?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMTkwNTI2MWU3NDQ4MGE4MDc1OGNmYmQ1YWMzNjM0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. I thought long and hard about this. Every other Angel will revert to where they were when the backup was made. My heart says we should keep their memories. But in the end, this will give you the power to choose whether to tell them or not. Tell them ‘the truth’… or keep them in the dark as they have been. I’m sure Hikari can convince them of the truth if the need arises, even if they won’t remember anything.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNTFlZGJiODExZDQ2OTZhODVmYzQ4YzNkZDc0NDI3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hikari remained in silence, deep in thought.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZTUzNDE5MGJiOTQ0MTBiYmIzMTU1ODg3OGYzM2I4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“In your case, Shiina, I suppose I could just restore your previous permissions, and then you’d lose your memories like everyone else. I just assumed you’d like to keep them… but it’s your choice.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ODZkMDhiZDkzMTRiZTE5ZGI1Y2M5OWFlM2U1YjJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I… huh…”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwODgyZjIxN2NkYjQ5YTA4N2M0Njk3ZTA3ZDhhNzBm"><span style="font-weight: 400">A few moments of silence passed, with the former angel deep in thought. She thought hard about the proposal Ayumi made, but the barrage of information clogged up her brain. She couldn’t decide one way or another.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmN2Y3NzU0MjU0ZTQ2OWNiMDE4NDYwYThmZDVmYjEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl, meanwhile, was growing restless. It was faint, but the darkened sky was slowly giving way to twilight.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYzFjYWVhZmYwMzRiMzg4OTUxMzRlYWNkZDlmNWY1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, darn, the Illumination is nearly done. I don’t to pressure you, but have you reached a decision, Shiina?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZTM3ODU2NzNkYTQzNzk4NDYwZTRlYjQ0OWY4ZjE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I’m sorry, Ayumi. I need… more time.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YzZkZjk3M2Y4ZTQ5Zjk5MDgxZGU2MjlmNjk3NDA4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand, but I can’t really wait much longer. For now, I’ll turn you into an archangel as well, and you can decide later if you want to keep those permissions and your memories, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OGJiYWE3NTA3OTRkMjFhOTgxMjhiNTFkMDg0YWM1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A-Alright.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MjU3NjU0OWU2ZTRlNzk4NzYxMDg3NTM0ZWUxZTI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“With all that done, I guess it’s time for my final warning.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYzJmYzE1MjgyMTQxYWM4MDY1ZTM5ZmM3MTIyOGY5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? There is even more?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNDVlZDgwZjJmODRjNTE5NzJlZDI2M2FlNWM2MDMy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry, Hikari. This is a quick one. It relates to Takkun.” She paused for a beat. “The only way to let him keep his memories was either to turn him into an angel, or… leave him with my permissions.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZWY1MjI4M2JmOTQwYTQ4NGE4ODA4MmM2ZmVmZDI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait, you mean…?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYjE3YWU4NWM4NDQyOTJhYWU2YWY5M2RmMDk1ZWEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ayumi led her hand to her chest. “Yes, this backdoor my parents left me… their final gift to me… I’ll leave it with Takkun.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZjA1NjU3NjU5ZTRlOTE5YTZhODU2MTc4Y2JmYzll"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hold on,” Hikari began. “Does that not mean he can use the same ridiculous powers you can? I do not think he is the type of person to abuse those powers, but still….”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMjM2YTE5YmQ2YzQ4ZGZiZGUyODVhYTExM2MxNjU5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Relax, Hikari. Remember what I said earlier? I had to train a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">lot</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> during this past week to be able to use these powers effectively. And even then, I’m sure my form is ridiculous when compared to yours. As long as you don’t tell him, he won’t even know he can use his powers, so he won’t get into trouble. Probably.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MDgwODY5NjIyMjQxN2I4YTlmOGIzZmEzZjgwN2Nl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“P-Probably…?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0M2JiMmJlM2Q3NTQ0NzRiM2RiMGFmMTg1MzI2MWRj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“But wait,” Hikari began. “Couldn’t you turn him into an archangel too? Why transfer your ‘backdoor’ to him?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZGIxODZkM2MyNjQxMmZhYmQxYmNjNmIyMmM5ZGFi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm.” Ayumi seemed to consider the question for a moment. “I suppose I could have, but… I feel a bit bad about letting these permissions go alongside me, you know? And besides, you might actually need them in the future.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYWYxN2JhMjI3ZDRlNGRiNzZhNDY3M2E0YmU5OTYy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...How so?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYTFlMTJjMDVjMTQ4ZDNiZmIzNjVjYTVhMmQyNDcz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, to be honest, my parents never left any documentation about this. We just kinda tried a few things and, well, here I am, I suppose.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYzBhM2M3ODlmZDQxZWQ5MTViNDE3OGY0MjhlN2Fk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You suppose…?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMjFhYzkzN2JmMDQxNjBhMjdmNThmNzdkM2ZiOGE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So there might be a few hidden systems where these permissions might come in handy. So think of him as a trump card in the back of your mind in case you need it.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNjA0N2U4MTYxODQ2YzM4NjAwNjE2NzdiMDZmZjBl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A trump card, hmm…”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDdiMmI4NjAxMzQ4ODJhNjVhMjUzNjcyOGE1NmNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Or just someone to talk to about ‘the truth’. He might not look like it, but he knows a lot about computers and stuff. I’m sure he’ll jump at the opportunity if you decide to involve him again. It’s your choice.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDJiNTkzZDIwMTRkZGZhNmQyYjEyOTc0NjY2YTU1"><span style="font-weight: 400">The girls didn’t respond to Ayumi’s challenge, so with a spring in her step, she moved on to her closing argument.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMWI5ZGExYjc3YTQ5YzBhZDBlYTQ3NTM4YTJjMjQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, now I really am running out of time. There are some final preparations I need to do in the Controller to make sure the reinstallation of Gaia happens smoothly.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTAyYzgxOThmMjQ2ZDM4OTNkMDY3MDQzMjhlZDFh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ayumi passed by the two women, in the direction of the sacred Shrine that was behind them. She climbed the two steps leading inside and turned back to them.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZjZhYjk1ZjEzYzRhNTBhYTk5ZTg5YzUzMzA0ZDU0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s no point in having you feel yourselves disappear from this New Gaia, so I’m making you and the entire Upper Realm faint.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYzY0YmVjMjdkYTRiMTlhOGZkY2I5NmZjZDFiYjdm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait…” Hikari tried to get another comment in, but Ayumi stopped her.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNWM0YzMyOTRhNzRlNTFiZmE3MDA5MzY2ZDEyYWQ0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is our goodbye. Shiina, Hikari. It was truly a pleasure to meet you both. I wish the best for this world.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ODFmMmIyZWE2YjQxMGRiNjY1Y2NmNjc1MGMzZTk1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ayumi gave a bow—a deep, meaningful one.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0Mjk0NTcyNzAzNzQ4OGFhNzg4MmI2ZTMzNTM2ZTIz"><span style="font-weight: 400">The last thing Shiina and Hikari remembered was fainting—certainly a new sensation for beings who normally caused the fainting.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmY2ViMGQzNTIzMDRmZmViNTUzYTY3YTVjMmY4ZmE0"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a sensation they didn’t find too pleasing.</span></p>
