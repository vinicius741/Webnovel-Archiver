   Emma awoke from the best sleep she’d ever had in this vampire life. The comfortable bed made her fall asleep the second she’d rested her head, and when she opened her eyes, she saw the little Sora sleeping soundly next to her.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Sora looked nearly ethereal in her new fairy outfit. The white dress seemed to sparkle, and there was a cute little bow tied to the front. On her back there were detachable wings that Emma felt proud of.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Moonlight filtered in through the small window provided above the bedside table. Emma felt a small amount of hunger gnawing at her, and she cautiously stood from the bed, making sure not to rouse the little girl. Emma remembered that Lunaria had fallen asleep on the other side of the large bed, yet she was no where to be found.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma channeled magic into the small bracelet on her arm and found that she could locate the dragon mentally.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The vampire looked to the sword resting against the wall and spoke softly. “Watch out for Sora for me. I’m going to go find that dragon.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   There was no mental response except for Karlack’s warm blue glow.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma nodded and slipped from the room. She pressed her body against the wall and clung to the shadows. While she looked less like a vampire than before, any observant human could still pick up her fangs at least. Moreover, this world had magic, and Emma reasoned that there were likely many ways to tell her apart.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   As she went through the hall, she found a small opened window on the second floor, and her body turned into a mist, slipping outside into the darkness below.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The sensation of the bracelet led her to the nearby horse pens, and she quickly found the dragon sitting on an old well between the wooden kennels.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “What are you doing?” Emma whispered to the dragon.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Lunaria patted her lap. “Come, sit here.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The vampire felt her face heating again from the thought of sitting in that girl’s lap. She remembered the massage from earlier and felt a warmth spreading through her body.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “No way. You’re going to tease me again.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The dragon sighed and tapped her lap once more. “No, you really need to sit here.” A playful smile tugged at Lunaria’s lips. “Otherwise, I won’t tell you why I’m out here.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma frowned but found the compulsion of knowledge even greater than her embarrassment. She strolled over to the dragon and yelped when Lunaria yanked her by the waist, pulling her into her lap, and hugging her.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “Now I’ve got you.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “Did you really just want to capture me? What about…”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “Shh, keep your voice down, darling.” Lunaria pressed a finger against Emma’s lips. With her other finger she pointed to the sky. “Look at the moon.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma blinked and confusion and looked where the finger was pointing. She found a bright and full moon that produced a warm glow. Unlike the moon from Earth, this one had a strange hue to it. Emma had no idea why she never noticed the slightly blue hue. The glow was just barely visible, but if one squinted, they could see a blue outline around it.

  <p align="left">
   Lunaria’s voice became quieter as she whispered into Emma’s ear. “What do you think?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “It’s beautiful…”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma turned around and met Lunaria’s purple eyes. In their reflection she could see her own blue eyes.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “Yes, they are beautiful, aren’t they?” Lunaria asked.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   A puzzled look came over Emma. She had no idea what the dragon was referring to. Moreover, she had never realized that Lunaria’s eyes were so purple and striking.
   <em>
    Did she always have purple eyes?
   </em>
  </p>
  <p align="left">

   Each second that passed, Emma found herself getting more and more lost in them. She etched even closer to get a better look before the voice of the dragon stopped her.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “Didn’t you want to know why I came out here?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma flinched. “You didn’t come out here to get me to look at the moon?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Lunaria chuckled. “You can look at the moon all you want, and I don’t mind if we keep going. But I thought you were curious…”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The vampire felt her face growing red as she leapt from the dragon’s lap. “You tricked me.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “I don’t think I did anything of the sort.” The dragon leapt to her feet and wrapped an arm around Emma’s waist. “You can always ask me if you want to dance underneath the blue moon.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Before Emma could speak, the dragon pressed a finger against her lips once more.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “If you’re too loud, you’ll awaken Arrow.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “Arrow?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The dragon nodded and pulled Emma towards Arrow’s pen. She pushed the wooden gate open with a smile, and the sight that greeted Emma filled her with shock.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Gone was the large horse, and what replaced her was a naked girl sleeping on the ground.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The woman was tanned. She had hooves instead of normal legs, and she had a horse tail coming from just above her butt. Her ears were brown and pointed, and the woman slept soundly. Her large chest rose and fell as the girl snored on a pile of hay.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “Is that…”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma’s voice was enough to rouse the woman from her slumber. Arrow jumped to her feet and ran over. She scooped the vampire into the air and wrapped her muscular arms around.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The horse girl cheered as she squeezed Emma in a bear hug. “Mistress! Mistress! Mistress!”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma struggled to catch her breath, while the nearby dragon chuckled.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “I think you’re breaking your mistress.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Arrow’s big black eyes widened as she dropped Emma back onto the ground. “I’m sorry!”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “I don’t understand,” Emma said, “Why did Arrow become a woman?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The horse girl frowned. “Arrow wanted to be able to understand and talk to you better, so Arrow thought she would look like the others! It worked! Arrow just had to use your magic!”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “You used my magic?” The vampire asked. With a thrust of her hand, she foisted a large white sheet towards the horse. “Also, you should cover yourself.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Arrow wrapped the sheet around herself with a smile. “I’m so happy!”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “Right, you were so happy you fell asleep?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The horse girl looked at Emma in confusion. “No, the magic made me fall asleep.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Lunaria giggled and didn’t miss the opportunity to tease Emma. “It seems that all of your fantasies involve cute girls, so that’s why they keep turning into these kinds of forms. First it was Karlack, and now it is Arrow.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “You make it sound like I’m trying to start a harem or something! I’ll have you know that I don’t enjoy harems…I’d rather just have one woman.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “And who would that be?” Lunaria asked and pinched Emma’s chin.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The vampire felt a shiver run down her spine. She pushed the dragon’s arm away from her and focused on Arrow. “More importantly, we can’t have you sleeping outside now.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “Arrow doesn’t mind sleeping outside. The hay is comfortable.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “No, at least if you’re going to sleep on the floor, you should do so in our room.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Lunaria tapped on Emma’s shoulder. “Aren’t you forgetting something?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “What?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “You need your midnight snack, right?” Lunaria asked, pulling down the collar of her top ever so slightly.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “That can come later!”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Lunaria grinned and planted a kiss on Emma’s cheek. “As long as you don’t forget about me, darling.”
