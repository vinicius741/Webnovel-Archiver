<p class="cnMwZTkwOTk4ZGM5ZDQxM2I4N2QwYjE1N2QxYTUyYjg4" style="margin-bottom: 0">The low thrum of a familiar engine caused Cindy to perk up. Looking up from where she was welding a mount to turn a fixed gun into a turret onto her tiny new boss’s ship, she raised an eyebrow as she spotted the sleek black form of the modified Delta-6 returning. She frowned as she watched it set down in its assigned bay beside the <em>Rusted Silver</em><span style="font-style: normal">, something about the landing feeling very… </span><em>unnatural</em><span style="font-style: normal"> to her eye.

For a moment, a thrill of dread ran through her at the possibility of what she might be about to find. If her boss hadn’t climbed out already, then there could only be a few reasons for that—and Cindy could think of a few that might actually be her fault, if she had messed up somewhere. She </span><em>doubted</em><span style="font-style: normal"> it, but it was possible. The life support system could’ve been wired in backwards, or could have shorted. Or the inertial dampener failed and the cute red girl had blacked out at some point on her return.</span></p>

Stuffing the data disc down the top of her bikini, she grabbed the lightsaber and hopped out, closing up the hatch. Looking the weapon over, her lips twitched up into a mischievous little smile as she studied it for a moment to determine how it worked. Finally, she reached up and thumbed a ring at the top to the left.</p>

Finally, she shut it off and pocketed it, before hurrying over to her work truck—a yellow speeder with an enclosed cab, equipped with a much larger engine than was standard and a set of tow cables in the front and back. Leaving the shop, she set off for the palace on the hill overlooking the city.</p>

With it captured, their informant, sleeper agent, or whatever this person is might decide to scuttle the ship rather than let us interrogate any prisoners or scrape data from its logs. You’re the only ones with the access and authority to both monitor what’s going on from the ground and order the navy to stand down before someone starts shooting—and if they shoot anyway, to have them dealt with.”</span></p>
