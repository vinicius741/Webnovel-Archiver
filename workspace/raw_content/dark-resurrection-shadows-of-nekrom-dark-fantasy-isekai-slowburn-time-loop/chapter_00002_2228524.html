She slammed the door shut and, after crossing her arms, began to pace in circles. “Is everything going to go wrong? What a horrible week!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZjVjNWUzYzk5ZDQxZDdhZjkxY2M4MTM1ZjM0MzBh" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Her restless eyes scanned every corner of her room as she walked. The white walls lessened the feeling of dizziness, but the static gazes of her countless dolls slowly turned into a shower of bright stars that danced in front of her. Inside the large bookshelves opposite each other, wearing beautiful dresses of different colors and styles.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYTE2M2NkMTZjMjQyYmI5YThhMmFmMjM1ZGM3ZjU5" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Every doll stared at Tristessa as she unleashed her tantrum, uncharacteristic of a girl her age.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MDlkMDk3NGQ1YTRjYzU4N2Y5NWMyNDJmYzY5Y2My" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Uh… I stained the carpet,” she complained as she looked down to mitigate the feeling of lightheadedness and saw a trail of black dirt forming an almost perfect circle as a result of her walk.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ODFhNmI1NzMxNzRkOWViYzY3N2JhY2NmNmU4ZGI1" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">She quickly took off her shoes and socks, both completely stained with that dirt that smelled of <span style="color: rgba(224, 62, 45, 1)"><strong>[</strong><strong>rot</strong> <strong>and metal]</strong></span>, and threw them in the direction of the door.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkODk2MmYxY2JmODQ4ZGVhNDkyZjA3NmFmYWRiYzAz" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Wrong, wrong and wrong!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZGM3OTFkZjQ0NDQyN2I4ZDUxOTExZTE5ZDcwNjJk" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Tristessa stopped to breathe and not lose her balance even more, standing almost facing her large mirror.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmM2UwMDA0ZDBmNjRiZjk4Yzk3ZTllOWJiYmFhMDUy" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Her reflection showed her the face of a sixteen-year-old girl overwhelmed by fatigue, perspiration and exhaustion. Her long black hair, which she took care of with extreme care, was untidy and tangled. She was wearing light blue shorts and a purple wool jacket with a hood, both with some dirt stains. And her eyes, gray like a cloudy day, returned a half-closed look as if her eyelids weighed a ton.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YzFkMWFmMWY2YjRmZWNiM2MxZjYxNGQ0ODBlOTM0" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Her forehead, armpits and torso dripped with sweat, as if she had run a marathon and expelled every last drop of water from her body. She was not sleepy, but the fatigue could be felt down to her bones.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYWM5YmM4MjU2ZDRhNjhhOWM3YjAzOWUzNGMyZjgy" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">After all, it had been a very <em>difficult</em> week… Right?</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMWYwM2Y5YTBmNDQwNDk5ZjBjNmExMjcyNGJlOGM1" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“<em>Of course it was! Nothing went the way it supposed so, it was shit in its purest form</em>!” she thought. Her bed, fluffy and smelling of flowers, was an absolute temptation for her tired body, but first things first, there were other priorities. Tristessa decided take the chair in the corner and drag it in front of the mirror. “Just a little, and then a bath.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMDYxYjRhMmU4MjQ1NGViYzc1OGFlMDgzNTkwNTBi" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">On top of her nightstand, there was a night light and the <span style="color: rgba(224, 62, 45, 1)"><strong>[severed head]</strong></span> of a<strong> <span style="color: rgba(224, 62, 45, 1)">[stuffed bunny]</span></strong>, which Tristessa didn’t even notice. She rummaged through the drawer, and among pieces of fabric, <span style="color: rgba(224, 62, 45, 1)"><strong>[pins]</strong></span> and a pair of <span style="color: rgba(224, 62, 45, 1)">[<strong>scissors]</strong></span>, she found her ever-trusty comb.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NGJlNGI2NGVhMDQwYTQ5NGY1ZTQ1Yzk0MmQ1YTA4" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">She sat down on the chair to begin the arduous task of returning her hair to its former state of grace.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NzRiZWJlNTViODQ0ZjY4ZTBkZmFiN2U0MjUwZGFk" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">That always helped to calm her down. To appease her rising anger.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMDQ0NjY4YjQwMDRmYmRiY2JmNjFjZWExMDU2Zjdi" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“I still can’t believe all that happened… Damn it,” she growled under her breath, her reflection obeying in replying to her wrath. “And it’s all <span style="color: rgba(224, 62, 45, 1)"><strong>[Mom]</strong></span> and <span style="color: rgba(224, 62, 45, 1)"><strong>[Dad]</strong></span>’s fault! Yeah… Those two… Huh?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlM2M1N2I0MjU4MTQwZDM4OTEyYTFiMGYzZDhiMTlj" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">She paused the movement of her comb for a few seconds, frowning thoughtfully.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZTIzMTY5YWJlNTQ2MDZiYTgwNjVjZTlhZjBiNDVl" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“That’s weird… What happened to them?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTNlZjU5ZTYzZDRlNWNiMjAyMGE4YTVmOTQzOWE5" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Biting her lower lip, Tristessa searched for the answer in the reflection of her gaze in the mirror, but found nothing. Whiteness, emptiness. Nothing at all.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTFjMWIzYjQ1OTRhNmY5NjgzMjc4NWFiMmRmZjk3" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Bah! They did something wrong, I know!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhODM4MGE1MDEwMzRhZTBhMzJmNWQ2ZmRhOTljMTE3" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Was it because Dad kept making that annoying sound with his throat?</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMWQxNzA3ZjNlNDQ1YzM5NTgwYWY0OGRlNDY3MGI5" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“<em>You’re so adorable when you’re angry, my little princess</em>!”</span></p>

<p class="cnMwOWUzM2M3NWFhMDQ3NmE4ZTRmNmVlZGNmMzVjZjBi" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“<em>Okay, okay, I’ll stop</em>!”</span></p>

<p class="cnNlMTBmNzEwZTlkYzQwY2NhMWI4ZDNmMjU0MTdjYTEy" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Mom…” Tristessa whispered, confused as her right hand started to tremble. Like with her dad, her mom’s face had no place in her mind. It was strange… She only remembered absolute <span style="color: rgba(224, 62, 45, 1)"><strong>[silence]</strong></span>. “Mom?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMjYxYmQ5ZWFjNDRlNTc5NjFjYmZjODhlNjcyOGM3" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">She involuntarily pressed the comb hard against her scalp, distracting her from that totally fragmented train of thought. She rubbed her head, feeling more and more confused, and began to feel a slight discomfort behind her eyes, like an itch… It was as if there were ants walking aimlessly inside her head.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZjRjNTljMWRmNDQwNWNhNjI3NGZkOGI0MTBiODMz" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">The girl searched her pockets for her handkerchief, her sweat becoming unbearable, but found a crumpled piece of paper.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDY5YjY4NGNkMTQ4NWE4NmUyMzM0YTZjYWJkY2Ix" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">A paper that she did not remember having kept there. No… It was a <span style="color: rgba(224, 62, 45, 1)"><strong>[photo]</strong></span>.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhM2I3Y2QzYjc4MjRiN2I5ZjQyMjIwNTczN2Y2MTNm" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Ah… What?”</span></p><span class="cjQwYjQ1NWU4Y2NkNjQ1NmJhMjU1NGU1NWMwNTIzYThi"><br/>This novel is published on a different platform.

Or at least, that was what she could distinguish since their figures had been totally altered by scratches and dirt, making any kind of recognition impossible. Only she herself was intact, the smallest among the other <span style="color: rgba(224, 62, 45, 1)"><strong>[four]</strong> </span>people, smiling foolishly.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZGY5MWFhMjBlNjRlOGNhN2JmODQ4MWRiOTI2ODY3" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“W-what is… what is going on?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOTlhNGNjYzA1NjQzMDk4OGEyZjNiNDY0Y2UxZGUz" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Now both hands were shaking, and the inside of her head began to hurt.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNjQwZjdmNDNjZjQ0Y2U4ZTlmZTcyMWZmN2IzMjBj" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">She instantly realized two things: she was short of breath, and there was a horrible, disgusting <span style="color: rgba(224, 62, 45, 1)"><strong>[smell]</strong></span> in her room. Breathing was becoming increasingly difficult; she could taste bile and vomit in her throat, driven by that smell that had spread everywhere.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZjU3ZDlmYmVkZDQzMGQ5NjBmYzIwN2E2ZTI0NzBj" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Ugh… Ahh…!” Tristessa managed to hold back the contents of her stomach, covering her mouth momentarily as her esophagus burned with pain. “What the…?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYzlhYTg1N2I4ZTQxNzI5Njc2OTJiMDk0NzYzZjQ4" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Around her, the dolls’ gazes projected an aura of heaviness that spread throughout the room, generating extreme uneasiness in the girl.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYzUwODlhMzAwYjRhZjdiMWIzNDk1ZjEzZTVlZjgx" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">The silence was disturbing, more than anything because the second hand on the clock on her nightstand had stopped hours ago, dying as it announced the hour <span style="color: rgba(224, 62, 45, 1)"><strong>[7:25:45]</strong></span>.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNjQ2MzhhMTBlNzQwZGJiNjI0ZmU4YmFlODk0OTI0" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">It wasn't long before Tristessa began to hear her own heartbeat, like drums in her ears, faster and frantic.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZjJiMjdlNDIyNDQyY2VhYjE5ZDYwZmU4OGRmMmFh" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Dad… Mom…” Tristessa muttered, looking around for answers to ease her confusion; answers to questions she hadn’t even asked. “Ah… M-my arms. It hurts…it hurts…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMGQ1NzkxZDQzMDRlM2RhMGQxZTk4NzBmNGM1ZmM2" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">No, it was her<strong> <span style="color: rgba(224, 62, 45, 1)">[forearms]</span></strong> that were emitting multiple stabs of discomfort. Constant, annoying, and sharp, coming from beneath her sleeves…</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YjU2YzZiYjlmZTRlZmVhMTQyYWZiMzU5MDcwNzk0" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">As Tristessa worked up the courage to see what was causing her forearms to hurt, she noticed movement in the periphery of her vision. She quickly looked up, finding herself in front of the mirror again, and saw that her eyes had been shedding tears for quite some time now, leaving wet trails down her cheeks.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmM2FiY2FiZTdkMDQ3MTE4MzM0ZDRjZDFmYzFhNmQ1" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">But that wasn't even the strangest thing: it was the<strong> <span style="color: rgba(224, 62, 45, 1)">[emptiness]</span></strong> that filled her gaze behind the mirror, and an emotionless grimace that did not at all reflect the dread Tristessa was feeling right now, which had just increased exponentially at that moment.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MTVlMzVlOTE2MjRhYzM4ZjMyYTk2MmMyNzNiOTc5" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“No…!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTRhMDBiMWRkYzRlOThiOTZiMGM5NjA1ZTRlYTQ3" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">As the girl instantly stood up in panic, her reflection raised her hand and pointed directly at her, freezing her in place. The real Tristessa closed her eyes tightly, refusing to see any more of that <span style="color: rgba(224, 62, 45, 1)"><strong>[entity]</strong> </span>that appeared to be her.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NzI3ODY4MTE1YjQyMThhNzY1YTdjNzA3NzM5OWIy" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Something inherently forbidden, not made for human eyes.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNTJmOGM1NTQ3NzQwMDQ4ODc4OWNlNTIzNjYwZWM5" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Impossible! It can't be! There's no way!” she whispered under her breath, over and over again. She kept hearing her heartbeat, so frantically as if it were about to explode. “Why?! What the hell is going on?! Why can't I…?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNmUzZTFjZGI3ODQ0MGQ4NGZiNjUyMDA5M2ZiZDE3" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Her mind spun uncontrollably, spiraling into an infinity of dark uncertainty. Her conscience had played a trick on her when she realized that there was something wrong there, in that room, and with herself.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNjM3MDU5YmM2NDQ2NDA5OTExZjdkNjBkZTllNTUw" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">In a matter of seconds, the order of reality she knew had collapsed, and she could not hold on to anything in that fall, there was no hand manifested in solid memories that could save her.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4N2NkZmE5MjFkMDRmMDc4YzY4NGM1MDA1MjIyYWJh" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Why can't I… Uh!

<p class="cnM1NWU4MGZmYWZkMzQzNjg5N2FhZTkwOWIwMmZiNjRj" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">There were no answers. Faced with that inconsiderate silence of the world, in the depths of that river of Lethean waters into which she had fallen, the girl managed to muster her courage and opened her eyes, still scared and confused.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZDdkMWViZGJmMzQ4NjBhMzg4MjllZmIxYmFkNzk5" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">And what welcomed her was not the mirror with its unnatural reflection, or the dolls on the shelves, or the room itself.</span></p>

<p class="cnNmNDMzZDliYmE5OTQ5MjVhMjAyYTFmYTNlNWVhNTU4" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Red on the ground, red falling harmoniously before her eyes, and red in the heights of a sky dominated by the sunset. She noticed the soft but cold wind that blew, caressing her face and making her hair stand on end.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMjAyY2VjZTJkNjRmNzhhZTBlNDljMWVmZmFhZmEz" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">A wind that made the tops of dozens of titanic trees that surrounded the clearing where Tristessa was, standing specifically at the epicenter formed by a pool of red leaves made up of those that fell incessantly from the trees around her.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNjgxN2FlN2Y4YTQwNzBiMDg4YzI3NWZkMTA4MmMy" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“N-no… How?” she muttered, unable to even interpret or understand it. She caught one of those falling leaves between her fingers: it was large, its brittle texture not only sent signals of autumn, but told her that it was real.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZGQ1MTViMTIyNzRjMTRiZTI2MjU1ZTJlYjA3OTYy" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">The cold, the sound of the wind, the trees. Everything was real.</span></p>

<p class="cnM4ZDdiYTFiZGFjNDQ0ZmI5YjU5NTNlZDQxYWE2YWZh" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Questions and more questions tormented Tristessa’s tired and confused mind. Not only could she not locate herself temporally, but now neither spatially.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTYxOGFhZWMxNTRkMjY4ZjRkYTNhMTM1ZWZhOGE4" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">The cold and fear of the unknown enveloped her soul. Looking around, there were only countless trees, giant and full of infinite red leaves on their countless branches and trunks of various sizes. She didn’t remember a forest like that near where she lived… But…</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ODQ2OGExZTNmMDRkMzliNWUwMmZkZjM2Nzk2MDlh"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“I… where do I live?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZmMxMWM3M2Y4ZDRkNGViZjA1NGY0NWFkN2Q2OWMy"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Tristessa's eyes widened as saucers before such absurd question and how it sounded in her head, but it was honest: she didn't remember her home, city or town, or even the country where she lived.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMWVkMjc5MjgyYzRiNzBhNGY5NDdlM2UyMzVmYWYy"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Everything that could connect her to her home was fragmented into thousands upon thousands of pieces inside her head. And that fact made her dig her nails into both sides of her temple, her frustration piling up until it overflowed in a scream that carried a repeated question.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YTEyYzQ2OGM4ZTQ4ZjVhYzc2YjYyOTM0N2NiZGEy"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Why can't I remember anything?!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMTgyYTRmMDNmYjQ4NjVhMWE4Mjc3ZDA5MWY4Nzhi" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Her voice echoed in the wall of trees, going beyond and getting lost in the penumbra that abounded inside the forest.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDNhMTZiMjRmNDRiMzA5ZmY3M2Y1Mjc0Yzg5NDY0" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Why…?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YWQ4ZDdiOWMwOTQ4NTI5ZTdmZjIyZjQ5MWFiZDg3" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Her question, which was going to be repeated for the third time, stayed in her throat because when she looked up at the sky, as if begging for help, she saw something that took the air out of her lungs.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZDMzZmJlNTBmMzQzMjRhMTRjZTQ4ODc1ZWY5Mjgy" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“No fucking way…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmODYyMWViZTJjZDRkYmJiODJhZmM2ODIyZjU4MmUx" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">A beautiful and clear sky, in which two queens ruled that celestial vault. Two Moons, one larger than the other due to the distance between them in the direction of the emptiness of space, and much larger than the single, solitary Moon she could remember.</span></p>
