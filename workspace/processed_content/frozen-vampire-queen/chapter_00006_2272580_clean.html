    The small crunching of snow kept echoing behind Emma as she walked. Her sword turned staff produced a glow each time. Emma sighed and shook her head at Karlack.
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    “It wasn’t my fault to begin with, so what do you want me to do about it?” Emma asked, receiving a sharp pain in her sternum in response. “Okay! Fine!”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    Emma finally turned around to the crunching of snow behind her and spotted a small head poking out from behind a tree. The instant the girl was spotted, she quickly hid her entire small frame behind the trunk.
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    “Hey! I know you’ve been following me, so just come out already!”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    The little girl flinched and slowly moved her body into the light. She put her hands up defensively and spoke in a small quivering voice. “You’re not going to eat me, are you?”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    Emma moved closer to the girl and sighed. “First of all, I need to know why you’ve been following me.”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    Sora shook her head, her shoulder-length brown hair flailing about with the motion.
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    “Well, if you don’t answer me, I might consider eating you.”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    “No! You can’t!”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    Emma chuckled at the distraught little girl. “So what’ll it be? Either you tell me why you’ve been following me, or you become my next meal.”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    Sora shivered as she looked up at Emma’s sharp white fangs. The little girl’s eyes became cloudy with tears. “Please don’t eat me!”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    Emma felt another sharp prick of pain coming from her staff. “Alright, alright! Geez, I wasn’t going to eat you anyway.”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    The little girl sniffled and wiped away her tears. “You weren’t?”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    “No, and why should that be a surprise?”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    “B-but, at the village you said…”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    “Bleh, bleh, bleh, who cares what I said before. That was then, and this is now. Though, I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t hungry…” Emma resisted looking at Sora’s wide eyes as the little girl giggled.
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    “I knew you weren’t a monster!” Sora yelled. The little girl excitedly jumped and wrapped her small arms around the vampire.
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    “No, no, you’re definitely wrong, little girl. I am a very evil monster who feeds on the blood of innocents.”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    Sora shook her head and buried it into Emma’s snowy outfit. “You’re not a monster. You’re just a little cold.” The little girl pouted as she continued. “Also, I’m not a little girl! I am Sora!”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    “Right, Sora, so why are you following me?”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    “Nu-uh, that’s not fair! You didn’t give me your name!”
   </p>

   <p align="left">
    The vampire sighed and nudged the little girl off of her. “I’m Emma,” she said before gesturing towards her staff, “and this is Karlack.”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    “Emma! I like that name!”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    The Emma in question scratched her cheek awkwardly. “Listen, little girl...”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    “Sora!”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    “Listen, Sora...you can’t just run after random strangers you don’t know. Especially if those strangers happen to be an evil vampire.”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    “Vampire? Is that what you are?”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    “Yeah, how’d you not know that? You’re far too naive for your own benefit.”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    “I am not! Mother already told me! Strangers are dangerous.”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    Emma sighed and poked the girl’s forehead. “And how do you explain this situation, then? How old are you, little girl?”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    “I’m ten! And you’re not a stranger!”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    “I am a stranger. Before this interaction, you didn’t even know my name.”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    “Well, now I know your name, so now we aren’t strangers.”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    Emma felt a headache coming along from trying to reason with a child. “You still haven’t told me why you are following me. How did you even manage to find my trail afterwards? I’m surprised you didn’t freeze to death.”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    “I started trying to find you because I wanted to thank you! The elders didn’t want me to leave, so I had to sneak out. Then I found you by following the river!”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    “You followed the river? Why?”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    “I figured that even monsters would need to get water.”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    “Hey! I thought you said I’m not a monster!”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    Sora giggled. “That was then, and this is now.”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    “You little…”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    “It’s Sora!”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    “Alright, fine. Sora? You can give your thanks and be on your way now. I’m sure those people will be worried about you.”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    The little girl shook her head. “I want to follow you!”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    “Nope. No, no, no!”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    “Why not? You’re all alone, aren’t you?”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    “I am not alone! I said it before. Didn’t I introduce you? This is Karlack.”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    Sora tilted her head at the staff and poked it. After receiving no response she looked at Emma with pity.
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    “Wait,” Emma said, “it’s really sentient. Go ahead, show her what you can do, Karlack!”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    The expected response of a glow never came, nor was there any pain to accompany her query. The only thing that responded was the wind giving a faint whistle in the background.
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    “Oh no! You’re not doing this!” Emma grabbed the staff with her other hand securely before putting a bit of force into it. “If you keep ignoring me, I will snap you in half!”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    A blue glow finally responded, and a searing pain attacked Emma’s chest. She could hear the snapping of bones before they wriggled around and stitched themselves together.
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    Emma winced from the pain before smiling smugly at Sora. “See, I told you this thing was sentient.”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    Sora stared at the vampire with wide eyes. “W-well, that might be true, but…”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    “No buts...Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a certain mission to get back to…”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    “What mission is that? Do you even know where you’re going?” Sora managed to stop the vampire in her tracks.
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    Emma whipped around with a frown. “That’s classified information, unfit for children to know.”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    Sora pouted and grabbed onto Emma’s arm. “I’m not a child! And what’s classified?”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    “How can you call yourself an adult if you don’t even know what that word means?”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    “Mother never said that word even once! You’re lying!”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    Emma bent down so her head was even with Sora’s. The vampire ground her teeth together in frustration. “So what if it’s a lie? I’m a monster, and you’re a child. You should be at home with those villagers.”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    “I don’t even have a home to go back to!”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    Emma recoiled from the change in emotions. She wasn’t sure if the sharp pain in her chest was coming from her weapon, or if it was a twinge of guilt from not being able to make it in time. The only sound she could produce was a faint groan that was more like a whimper.
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    “And your father?”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    Sora shook her head.
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    Emma sighed and tapped the little girl on the shoulder. “Fine, stop crying! You can accompany me to the next city...Wherever that may be, and then I will promptly dump you off at the first orphanage.”
   </p>
   <p align="left">
    The little girl smiled through teary eyes and wrapped her arms around the monster. “You’re so cruel.”
