<p class="cnM2YzdmNTZhYjI3NDQ0MjBhN2U3YzljNjc1ZmJmMjUw"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Undead… the topic itself was taboo in Geova. No one spoke of it. No research was permitted into it. All Geovans were taught from a young age that necromancy was a crime punishable by death, and had been ever since a disgruntled, ambitious necromancer - one whose name had purposely been lost to time - had nearly destroyed their entire civilization by accidentally reintroducing plagues from ages long past by animating very old skeletons. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0OGQ0ODM0OTdjNjQ3NGY5MDVmODcxZjAxNmMzNDg1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Necromancers were common enemies in children’s stories, and used as fables to teach children about the sanctity of the dead. That those who had died deserved to rest, and that nothing good would come of trying to bring loved ones back. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3MmY2ZDAzMzI4MTQ4YzU5ZjQwZDVlYWEyMWVlOTI0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Not even the Alchemical Workshop was permitted to do any sort of research on necromantic magics. There were tomes, apparently, that would teach the subject, but they were so heavily restricted that you needed a quorum of Elders to agree to unseal them, and the reader would be watched for the rest of their life to prevent misuse. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkODA5OGQxYzBkMzQxNjBiYWIwYjFkZGI0NTAzMGYz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Suffice to say, I don’t know anything about necromancy,” Dan finished heavily after explaining the restrictions put upon that knowledge. “So I can’t be sure. But if I’m right… if I’m right, then the Mist is, at its core, mana twisted by the Undead. It would explain so much! Why we commonly see Mistwarped beasts mutated and rotting on the insides, why they attack without any traces of self-preservation! Why the Mist hasn’t reacted to literally anything we’ve tried! Everything I am tells me that I’m right, or at least so close that I might as well be. But I don’t know how to fix it!” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0YzU5OGVkNTk0YTRhNTNhOGI1OWJiOWYyMjRlZTEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan pressed his palms into his eyes, clearly fighting the urge to scream in frustration. “The so-called ‘holy’ or ‘divine’ magic from children’s stories doesn’t exist! I can’t cast </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Turn Undead </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">and just wipe away a horde of skeletons, and I don’t even know where to begin to figure out a purification ritual, let alone one that </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">encompasses the continent to turn the Mist back into neutral mana!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwYzhjOGQ5YTY0MzQ1N2ZiN2YzYTI5NTgzZDNmZTZm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn breathed shallowly, her eyes wide in revelation. “Then… there’s only one thing to do,” she whispered. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwODVhMDY4MzIxMDQ0ZmNhZmIzODc1N2Q2ZGU0YmMz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan lowered his hands from his face, looking at Maeryn with a combination of aggravation and hope. “What’s that?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmOWRmNjhkNzYwZjRiYzNiNWViMTQyYTAwMjE1Y2Q4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn swallowed hard, licked her dry lips, and tried to calm the rapid pounding of her heartbeat. “We have to create holy magic. You need to learn necromancy, here in Airspire - assuming that it’s not forbidden in Zephyria. At least well enough to understand necromancy-oriented mana. And once you do, you learn to invert it. You’ll need to create a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Purify Undead</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> spell. That spell can then be used to purify the Mist, right? If we can get the mana cost of the spell to be less than the amount of mana gained from converting the Mist, then that would solve everything.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZDk3NjhjZWZlMTRjYjU4NzQzNGI5YzgwOGY1OTk3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan’s eyes went painfully wide. “You… you can’t be serious.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmYWZmMzY2YzZiNjQ2ZjFhZjkxNTNiNDBiM2Y1ZjZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn slowly shook her head. “Inverting mana is the basis of elemental resistance spells, right? Flame resisting enchantments require runes that take ambient mana and create inverted flame mana, right?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYWIxYTBkOTUwNDRkMjc5NTBiNDNmZmM2NTk2ZWEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, yes, that is the basics,” Dan sputtered. “But go back to you telling me to learn necromancy!” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3YjE2OGUzMDdkNzQ1MmNhMGRhZGE4Nzg0OWYyN2U3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe Graves will know it well enough for us to work with,” Maeryn admitted in a whisper. “I really, really don’t want you to have to learn it. But if there isn’t anyone with the skill… Dan, I’m sorry, but you are our magic specialist. We have to be prepared for the worst case. I’ll swear, on whatever you want, that I’ll keep your secret and never tell a soul.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTY3OGYzYjE1ODQzZWNhNGU1Y2U5OTUxYjFhNDY2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I…!” Dan cut himself off, trembling. “Depths and damnation, Maeryn!” He squeezed his eyes shut. “Fine! Fine. If there’s no one else, if it comes down to it… I’ll… I’ll learn necromancy. But it won’t happen! We’re going to find Graves, and I can study someone else using it without ever using it myself!” </span></p>
<p class="cnM2Y2Y2MDI4MDkzMjQzYWNiMTY0NmIxMjViMjdhMzlj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn nodded, biting her lip. There was a horrible pit in her stomach; she had a bad, bad feeling that Dan was going to end up having to learn the taboo magic. Had she just sentenced her friend to death or exile, permanently preventing him from ever being able to go home? </span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZjFiNzE0NTRkNDQ1ODNiNzg0ZGYwOWUwMWZkMjkx"><span style="font-weight: 400">No. No, they were going to find Graves, and if he wasn’t a necromancer they would find one here in Airspire. Dan wouldn’t need to learn it. Maeryn had to believe that. “We’re going after Graves first thing in the morning, at seven o’clock. Frankie, I want us ready to go the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">moment </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">that Research Assistant Ernesto joins us.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTlkOGM2Mjc5ZjRjMDhiZGEwNzI2YjlkNzA0Y2Nm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aye-aye, Captain.” Frankie’s expression was uncharacteristically serious, and she nodded solemnly at Maeryn. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzYzg3MWM0ZDFiZDRiOGE4M2ZmMjZhNTQzMWU2OTJh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Dan…” Maeryn hesitated, then softened her voice. “You did good today. Thank you for figuring out what’s going on. Right now, the next step involves getting to Graves, and I’ll need you at your best when we do. Get some rest.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlNWE1NTA5N2I3NzQ2MzZhYmJiMDNiYTcyMGUwZDJh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah… yeah, alright. Right. I’ll do that.” With that, Dan slowly got up and walked through the door to the adjoining room, closing the door lightly behind him. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzOTQ3NjNkOTQ1ZTQ3MDRiMTUyNzRkM2Y3Yzc2ZDZk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn and Frankie sat in silence for a few moments. “Any word on whether Terrance is coming back?” the pilot asked quietly. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlMTdjODZmODk3YTRkMzc4MzI3YjUwYjBiZTUyY2Vm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I haven’t heard anything, or even seen him since we split ways,” Maeryn replied just as quietly. “So I have no idea. But he was pretty good at knowing what we’re up to back on Cloudreach. I imagine he’s keeping an ear on us now, sort of. Maybe he’ll meet us in the morning. Or maybe he’ll be waiting when we get back. Or… or he won’t, and we have to live with that.” </span></p><span class="cmI0NDgxNzNmYWM5YzRhNjVhYjExOGVkZjc5NTc1Zjcx"><br/>Royal Road is the home of this novel.

<p class="cnM0MjdmNTRlYTZiNDQ2YTc5MDRlOGRkYWRjMGEwZGY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Frankie nodded slowly. “I hope he does come back. Maybe it’s just me, but I thought you two would be great friends.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0MGRjMmMzZThjZjRhYmViZDk1NzEyZDg0MjY5MGVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn smiled a little sadly. “I thought so, too.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM2MjhhOTUxNTQyZjRjMDg5OWNlNGFjODU5YzgxZmI0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Frankie looked down, then back up at Maeryn’s face, looking oddly vulnerable. “Rin… do you think that Dan’s right? That the Mist is the result of the Undead?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwMTFlMGE1NWMwMzQ2MzlhMDA2ZTdjMDc0MmQ1Nzcy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn closed her eyes. “I don’t want it to be true, either,” she admitted. “But… it fits. And Dan’s the smartest guy I know. He wouldn’t make a claim like this if it wasn’t the most likely theory he has.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZGZmY2I1ZmViYzRiZDY5MzNlN2MzODc1OTA4YTk3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was afraid you’d say that.” Frankie took a deep breath and sighed. “Was just really hoping that we weren’t literally entering a nightmare scenario.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDExZjVjMTk4YTQ2ZjQ5YjljNTRhNmI2ZTBhOTUz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, does it get more nightmarish than the end of the world?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZGRjM2RiNWQzOTRlNGY5YTIzMDFiMGFmYmMxOThh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rin, the end of the world via mysterious magical phenomenon is one thing. The end of the world because of ghouls and zombies infecting us with an Undead mana plague is another,” Frankie told her bluntly. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiY2VlYzI5NTdjNjRlNTBhODc5NDBkM2VkNWU2ODEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite herself, Maeryn laughed. “You’re not wrong.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMxYWEwY2NiZjNhMjRjNDViNTA5ZmIwMDBmOWM4Yzkx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“At least tell me that I won’t have to fight any Undead myself?” Frankie pleaded. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0OGVmYzQzNWQwMjQxNzliMjBmNmEyZDM5YThkODIy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You shouldn’t have to,” Maeryn reassured her. “Leave the fighting to those who are trained for it. You just focus on keeping Stonewing</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">up and running, okay?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjNmZmOGJkOTVjNzRlZmFiOGI5YzJlNTM2NTk0Mjk3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Frankie nodded, breathing a sigh of relief. “That I can do.” After a moment of companionable silence, she stood up. “Listen, I’m gonna go see if any of those vendors are still out. Feeling a bit peckish. You want me to pick you up anything?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMxYmYyMzI5YWUzMjRmMmNhYTc5MTYxNTA2N2JlYzBj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think I’m good. Just gonna get some rest for tomorrow.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMxYjM0MGExZGRkZDQ5NDY4NzQyODVhYzEzZjgzM2M3"><span style="font-weight: 400">She shrugged. “Suit yourself. See you in a bit.” She stood, dusted off her pants, and then left quietly without looking back. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZTc3MGJiYWMxMTRhMzFhMzhhZTc3MGJlODJmMjRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn watched her go with a complicated set of feelings nestled in her chest. “Sometimes, I wish I could switch tracks as easily as she does…” She shook her head. “Alright, come on Rin. Let’s get cleaned up and ready for bed.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM2OWQwNzEyZDFjMTRlMGJiZTE5ZjBiNDExMTQ5MTli"><span style="font-weight: 400">She quickly stripped down, hung up her captain uniform, and entered the bathroom. Stepping into the shower stall and twisting the knob until the water that flowed down her was just shy of scalding, Maeryn tried very hard not to think about the implications of their most recent discussion while she scrubbed herself clean.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNzc5MDY0ZmNkOTQzYjc4NzAzYTYxMTA5YWNlYmI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, she failed. The idea of necromancy, of the Undead being a key factor in the Mist… it was too big. She couldn’t </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">not </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">think of it, and it had her second-guessing her thoughts and decisions. Maybe they would be better off going back to Geova and reporting to the Elders their findings? No, the news was too inflammatory; no Geovan would use necromancy, so obviously it would have to be Zephyria’s fault. With racial tensions the way they were, it would create a conflict no one could afford.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYTQ5MmVmZjA3YTRiZGU4ZGQ4ZDNlNDM0ODc4Mzkw"><span style="font-weight: 400">What if they snuck back into Greenstone and stole the necromancy tomes? Would that help? … Probably not. And it was almost certainly close to impossible anyway, considering how under lock and key they were. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyODQyMjdjNmI3MzQxYmJhYWVhMTU4YjQ1ZWQ3ZGRk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Was she asking too much of Dan, to get him to learn necromancy against every taboo and moral code that had been ingrained into them since they were children? Yeah. She absolutely was. No question. Maeryn bit her lip unsurely. “Maybe… maybe I should be the one to learn it,” she whispered aloud, not quite sure how she felt about it. “I’m supposed to be the leader of the mission, right? I shouldn’t ask my friends to make sacrifices I’m not willing to… but there’s so little time, and magic’s not my specialty. Dan would probably learn it faster anyway. But maybe I should offer to learn it with him? For solidarity if nothing else?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmNzdjNWEwOWEzNjQwOTFhYTNlN2JiMWQxNWZmZDE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">She sighed, hoping from the bottom of her heart that Graves was still alive, and that her suspicions about him being a necromancer were correct. Realizing belatedly that she was done, Maeryn turned off the water and stepped out of the shower. As she dried off and dressed in comfortable sleepwear, her mind continued to churn. No matter how she looked at it though, no matter what angles she tried to imagine, Maeryn couldn’t see a cleaner solution. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkYTRmY2Y2MTllNzQyYzI5MmUyMjAxZmM0YTUwNzUy"><span style="font-weight: 400">If the Undead were involved, then Maeryn absolutely could </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">not </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">go to the authorities - neither Geovan nor Zephyrian - about it. There was no way the Zephyrian government would believe her even if she were to rant all day about how strongly Geovan society felt about the practice. And there was no way that the Elders would believe her that the Zephyrians weren’t trying to use them to kill all the Geovans. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwNjA4OWZhZjYxNDQ0N2FiZmRlOTViOTQ4OTFkZmFk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Which meant that it had to be taken care of quietly. At least for now. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjMTc3M2E0NzFiMjQ2MjU4YmZlMGQyOGJhMTdhMWE3"><span style="font-weight: 400">A thought struck Maeryn, then, as she snuggled under the covers: what if Graves actually was a necromancer, and what if he </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">had </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">used his magic to create the Undead and generate the Mist? What if he </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">had </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">been trying to kill all the Geovans? It was certainly possible that Graves was racist enough to try his hand at genocide. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwMmUzZGVhZGY4YjRmNDY4MGM3ZTdkOWUxZTRlYzEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn swallowed hard, trying to wet suddenly-dry throat. “Don’t catastrophize, Rin,” she chastised herself. “Don’t go borrowing trouble until you’re sure that it’s there.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhNmU4MzZlNDFmYTQwNGE4OTJkYWUwMGFkZTk1Zjk5"><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment the words left her mouth, Maeryn recognized where they came from, and she choked back a sob. That was the advice her mother always gave her when she was tired and overwhelmed, and she’d just echoed it to herself without thinking. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkY2NiNzVjMWMyYjRiNGRiMWQyZTYzNmE4YmE5NTg4"><span style="font-weight: 400">She missed her parents. She wanted more than anything to be able to see them right now, and get their advice. To be held in one of her father’s lovingly tight embraces as she lowered her guard and fell apart while he reassured her that everything was going to be okay. To sit down at their table together again, in their warm living room with her mother’s favorite herbal tea in Maeryn’s favorite cup nestled in her hands with the comforting aroma filling the air. To talk through the problem, and have their support in what they decided together. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwZjM2NDYyZTMwZDQxMjc5ZjBiNzA4YWYwZDY0OGE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">But her parents weren’t here. And Maeryn was in charge. She had to make those kinds of heavy decisions by herself right now. And she was so, so scared of screwing up, when there was so much at stake. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmOTljMTlkY2U2ODQ1M2I5M2YxYmNmNDVjYzBmZDNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’re gonna make it. It’ll all work out,” she whispered to herself, wiping her eyes roughly and trying to swallow down the homesickness that wanted to lodge itself in her throat. “It’s all going to be okay, Rin. Just focus on tomorrow. We’re going to go check on Graves, he’s going to be fine, and we’ll figure out how to invert necromantic mana, and we’ll solve the Mist problem, and then we can go home and take a break. So just breathe, Rin. Just breathe.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzZTgzYjAzZjYxNTQ5Nzk5MmNjNjMxNDk1N2Y2ZTM0"><span style="font-weight: 400">She took a deep, shuddering breath, following her own directions. The next one came a bit easier, and each following breath helped her calm down. Finally feeling in control of herself again, Maeryn sighed and closed her eyes. “Just focus on tomorrow, Rin. Focus on what’s right in front of you. The rest can wait.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0N2JkODg2OWUwNzQ3YjQ4MzdmOTQ3YjkwZTg2YjU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">With that tired resolve came a wave of exhaustion, and sleep overtook her quickly. </span></p>
