<p class="cnNjMWViZTY3OWYzYzQzZTQ5Zjc0ZDJjODg3NTFlNWMw" style="margin-bottom: 0">“What is it?” he asked, taking in the serious look on Jango’s face.</p>

<p class="cnNiMDE1NDY1N2RjZTQ3ZGJhMTZlNzEwMzJhZjVjYWZi" style="margin-bottom: 0">Jango shook his head. “No. Looks like it’s two of the masters. Dooku and the one you’ve been talking to.”</p>

<p class="cnM1M2Y0YzAwZWU2NzRmZTI5NmM3NjU2MjA4YWNlY2Mw" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Master Sifo-Dyas,” Jaster nodded. “Alright, I’ll be out in a minute.”</p>

<p class="cnM3ODA3NTNmMjk0ZjQwOTdhOWZlMDg2MWU3NTM1OWM0" style="margin-bottom: 0">Jango nodded and left, and Jaster took a moment to pull his boots back on, along with his belt, sidearm, and the chest piece for his armor. He didn’t think there would be trouble out of the Jedi, but he had a certain image to maintain among the troops.</p>

<p class="cnNkZTgyNjRhZTIyYTQ5ZDE5YzYxMjdkYjEwNmFiOGYz" style="margin-bottom: 0">Striding out of his tent, he found the two Jedi Masters standing in the middle of the camp. They were both facing southward, studying the sky. Frowning, Jaster made his way over. “Something wrong?”</p>
<p class="cnM3NzBlNzNhNjU5ZDQ3N2Y4ZjUzZWZmMWE4MTVlMDQ3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNkNjZlOWQ0ZWExNzQ2NmI4NTBjNDA3YmVmYmI0ZjIz" style="margin-bottom: 0">“It’s Tanya,” Master Dyas answered, looking away from the sky to meet Jaster’s eyes. “She was captured by the Death Watch.”</p>

<p class="cnMyNGY5Mjc1ZDM4YjRlNTI5N2IzY2IxMGNlMzUwODlh" style="margin-bottom: 0">Jaster stilled for a moment, before anger filled him. His jaw clenched hard enough that his teeth ached for a moment. “Jango. Gather the troops. I want us prepped and ready in ten minutes.”</p>
<p class="cnMxZTJlODA3YTdhNzQxZTU4NjhhN2ZlNGY1MzNiYWU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMxOTM4NjQ2N2Y4ZTRiMGY5YzZmNmNlYWViNWViN2Vi" style="margin-bottom: 0">Master Dyas shook his head. “Don’t bother.” When Jaster sent him a look that said he had better explain, <em>and quickly</em><span style="font-style: normal">, the man continued, “</span><span style="font-style: normal">She called back and reported that the site was secure. She took care of it. She’s coming here now. </span><span style="font-style: normal">Tor Vizsla had her kidnapped and brought to his camp. He threatened to kill her if we didn’t leave the planet. Based on what he said, he intended to strike against both factions tomorrow.”</span></p>

<p class="cnNkNTlhMTFhYzY0ZDQxMDRhOTVmYWZmMjUzMWM0MWQ3" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">“Which means he’s probably got assets in place,” Jaster murmured, earning a nod from Master Dyas. Looking to Jango, he said, “Put together a security team and send them to Sundari. Have them sweep the surrounding buildings for trouble. Put a strike team on standby. If she’s got actionable intel, I want to hit these bastards back, where they live.”</p>

<p class="cnM0YzhiZGMyMjEwMzRjNjhhMzc5YzY1NzRjMmYzM2Qy" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<span style="font-style: normal">Will do,” Jango agreed, and hurried off to carry out his orders.</span></p>

Thankfully, they didn’t have to wait terribly long.

On this model, there was a rotating wing assembly on the rear equipped with ion cannons, a double barreled laser cannon on top, </span><span style="font-style: normal">sensor pylons to either side of the cockpit,</span><span style="font-style: normal"> along with two missile tubes and a laser in the nose.</span></p>

That second option was worrying, but something he could deal with later.</span></p>

Tanya clambered out, stumbling as she made her way down to the ground. The two Jedi Masters hurried over and Jaster followed. Spotting Jango returning, he called out, “Get a medic!”</span></p>

<p class="cnM0MDNlZTcxZmVkNDQ3NDZiNzNjNGFmMTcyNTc0Yzlh" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">Jaster nearly fumbled as Tanya tossed a helmet underhand to him, before plopping down on the sandy ground. Dooku knelt in front of her and silently began checking her over, only for the girl to lightly brush his hands away from where he was prodding her. Turning the helmet in his hands, Jaster let out a quiet chuckle as he recognized just who it had belonged to.</p>
<p class="cnNiYjQyNTg5YzFmNzRkYjc4YjMzMDE1Nzg0NmI5MzI1" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>

His eyes were drawn downwards to her robe belt, and the much larger leather belt strapped on over it, where a </span><em>very recognizable</em><span style="font-style: normal"> rectangular lightsaber hilt hung. “…Is that what I think it is?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYmIxZmUwN2QwYzRhNGViMzZlNjIzODVmOTExNzg5" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>

Regardless of who wound up with it, be it him, Kryze, or the Jedi, it couldn’t stay with Tanya. Having the Darksaber would make her a target for every leftover member of the Death Watch, along with </span><em>every other</em><span style="font-style: normal"> Mandalorian who felt that having it would make them Mandalore by default.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1N2JmMDI2ODg3YzRlMzM4MWEzYThkNzc4YTZjYjRl" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNjY2Q2M2ZjZWZlMDQ5NjhhNDkzZWI2NWJiMjI1Mzlh" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">The girl frowned, before asking, “Why not?”</p>

<p class="cnM3NjJjOGMzMjllNzQzZTdhNDM2YjBlYzU5ZDljYzIx" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">“It’d make you a target for anyone wanting to claim the title of Mandalore,” Jaster explained, and her frown deepened.</p>
<p class="cnM2MWNhZDMxNGE3MjQzMzY4NTcwNzc4ODdlOTAxMzM3" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM0ZTlmZTExM2ViYTRmODFiYjNhNzgxNWY2NTE3NmUx" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">“We can discuss what to do with it later,” Dooku decided, and Jaster nodded his agreement. “Tell us what happened.”</p>

<p class="cnNhMmY0NjRlMTYwMDRlZjhiMzBhY2FmNDU4OGNiZDVi" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">It was at that time that a medic came rushing up and Master Dooku stepped back, letting the medic take his place, the man quickly stripping the girl’s outer robe off to get a better look at her wounds and start cleaning and disinfecting them. As he worked, Tanya began her after action report.</p>
<p class="cnNjMmE1NmYxMWMwMTQzYTRiN2FhYWEzNGNlNWM0NGZh" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>

<p class="cnM4MjhjY2RhYTY1MjQ1MjZiODU1Y2VkZjdkMTU5MzU1" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal">Jaster listened as she went through the events dispassionately, </span><span style="font-style: normal">breaking down everything that happened and her reasoning at every step of the way with a sort of objective thoroughness that he </span><em>wished</em><span style="font-style: normal"> he could hammer into the rest of his troops. “…And that was when I engaged a combat stimulant formula </span><span style="font-style: normal">and painkillers</span><span style="font-style: normal">.”</span></p>

Looking between Jaster and Dooku, the man said, “Nothing immediately life threatening, but she needs more treatment than we can provide here. The cauterized flesh needs to be excised, </span><span style="font-style: normal">cleaned, and dressed properly. I don’t have the tools or a clean room to do it in the field.”</span></p>

<p class="cnNiYWQ5MjExNTgyZTRhMTJhNzkwNDg5MTNkNDc2ZGEy" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM4NjI1M2I2NmViOTQ1MWNiNmM5MmVjZDUyYzE0ZDJh" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">Tanya shrugged. “I don’t care. I was more worried about losing feeling, movement, or function.”</p>

<p class="cnM5MmRlZjE3MzMzZDQ2MjliMjM3ZDIzNDQzY2FiOWE4" style="margin-bottom: 0">The medic nodded, before turning back to Dooku. “The sooner she goes, the better.”</p>

<p class="cnNjYzhkYzA5N2Y4OTQ1YWNiZDFmZDI5ZTQ0Njk3MDEx" style="margin-bottom: 0">“I’ll take her now, then,” Dooku agreed, and bent down, picking the girl up in his arms.</p>
<p class="cnM1M2E3ZTIyOGFkMDRmZTQ5MjAyYmQwMDQ2NjM3NTMz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMwNDY2NTkyYmIyNTRmZmY4ODFkNmZjZjE1MGNlMmNj" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Ah, before we go,” Tanya said, leaning around him to look at Jaster. “I collected a bunch of armor and weapons off of the fallen Death Watch. You’re welcome to it. I’ve already taken what I want and left it in the cockpit.”</p>
<p class="cnNlOTVkNzUzZjNhZTRiNmZiNzI0NDNiMDFkYzJmN2Uw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM2ZDU5NTRmNjE4YzRmYzNhOWE1M2EwMmZiNzBmOTMx" style="margin-bottom: 0">Jaster nodded. “We’ll have it cleaned up and ready when you get out.”</p>

<p class="cnMwY2YyOTBmMGFlYTQ4NmNiNjZiYTFmZTcxZDMwNTI2" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Also,” she squinted and, a moment later, a hologram sprang up above her palm. “This is where their camp was. There are more supplies there. The survivors fled southeast.”</p>

<p class="cnNlNzdiODRkYmEzNjRkOTViYjZlYmI2YTM1ZjJhNWVj" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Towards Keldabe. Jango,” he turned and found Jango already moving away, knowing what he wanted.</p>

<p class="cnMwMTAwYmM2ZGI3YjQ0ZjZiYjllM2FhOWZiYjk4MzE4" style="margin-bottom: 0">The girl nodded and the two Jedi Masters made their way back to their ship. It took off, turning for Sundari. Jaster made his way over to the ship Tanya had arrived in and poked his head in the hatch. Whistling quietly at the pile of armor on the deck, he turned and waved over a couple of his people.</p>
<p class="cnM0MDcwNTNjYmE3YTRmMGZhZTEwM2ZmZDIzMTkzN2M1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNlMWFhYzNmMjRlYzQ3NGRiMDM5NGIzYTAxM2JmOWRj" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Gather this up and have it redistributed to any who need it. Any left over, melt it down into ingots.” Pointing to a set of black armor he recognized as belonging to Vizsla, matching the man’s helmet, he pointed it out. “Except that. Melt the armor down into ingots and keep the weapons. Keep it separate from the rest and put it back on this ship when it’s done. And get a couple of people in here to go over this thing for traps and do maintenance on it.”</p>

<p class="cnNhMzYwNGZjNTYyYzQzODE4NTdiZDQwY2JkNDhkYmZl" style="margin-bottom: 0">He didn’t wait for them to acknowledge him. Instead, he made his way inside, up to the cockpit. He raised an eyebrow at the crate of grenades sitting beside the pilot’s seat, along with the blaster rifle. “Girl likes her hardware,” he murmured, taking a seat. “Now, let’s see where you came from…”</p>
<p class="cnM2YTllMzIzODZlODQzZmY5OGY2MzRmN2Y1YjgwMDk2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMyNzUyMzRhODA4ODQzYmU4MmMzNWY2MDlkMGYxOWY1" style="margin-bottom: 0">Powering the computer on, he was greeted with a brief splash screen showing the SRS logo, the schematic of the ship, and the model name: GAT-12h Skipray.</p>

<p class="cnMwMWM1YzFjM2FmYzQ1NmM5NWFmODlhZjJjZTYxOWVl" style="margin-bottom: 0">The door opened a moment later and Obi-wan hurried inside, stopping beside Dooku and Master Dyas. The girl looked and felt upset to his senses as she asked, “What happened?”</p>
<p class="cnM3OTZmNzNjYjMxYjRhZmU5MjZmNTc2ZjM3NmQyMjA4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNlOGFmMTAyN2QyZTQwMzZiNWI0MTc1NWMzNjM0OWUz" style="margin-bottom: 0">“She was kidnapped and fought her way out,” Master Dyas answered as they watched the surgeon carefully clean the last of the unconscious girl’s wounds free of blackened, charred flesh. A nurse sprayed them down with more anti-septic and a sealing agent, then they rolled the gurney out of the room.</p>
<p class="cnMwMGI0MTNiZTE4ZTQ3OTA4ZjZmMDI5ODM2ZTk4NjYx" style="margin-bottom: 1em">The surgeon pulled off her gloves and mask and made her way out into the room where the three of them were waiting. “We’ll be moving her to a bacta tank from here, where we’ll keep her in an induced coma for the next few days—”</p>

Ammunition capacity, heat dissipation, strength of each shot, and range. If I could increase their penetration power, or the damage they did on hitting an enemy that would be ideal. I’d need to strip them down, have a look inside, and do some research to find out the best way to modify them floating around on the space internet.</p>

Memories of my own weapons, back as an aerial mage. All of our weapons had been enchanted, as had every single bullet. I’d spent countless hours enchanting my own formula bullets alongside my men. The formulas for that were pretty much imprinted in my memory.</p>

I had come out of the tank covered in what I had learned was bacta. The stuff was gel and stuck to everything. In every crevice. In my hair. And if I’d let it dry, it would have been a nightmare to get out. Thankfully, the hospital provided soap and shampoo for that purpose, and had flushed it out of my ears for me before the shower.</p>
