<p class="cnNkM2JiZDZjZjEzMTQwZGRiNDFmNWY4MzkwMGJmODBm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn woke slowly, blinking up at the pale morning sky. For a long moment, she didn’t understand why she was outside or why her muscles felt stiff and cold. She shifted slightly, the unfamiliar sensation of rough straw beneath her reminding her she wasn’t in her bed. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkY2Y3M2FhZmQ2OTRjYTliZWE0YjJkOTlhMmJlMDMw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then the previous day’s events came back to her, and her eyes shot fully open. She sat up, looking around, and saw Dan and Terrance quickly coming closer; they must have spotted her waking up. Maeryn opened her mouth to ask for an update, only to be interrupted by an unholy rumble from her stomach, accompanied by a deep, gnawing ache like nothing she’d ever felt before. It was as though she hadn’t eaten in days, and that - more than anything else in the scant time she’d been awake - scared her. “How long did I sleep?!” she demanded, injecting as much urgency into her voice as she could. “And please tell me you have some food!” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0OTdjYzRhZGIyNTQ5MzdiOTk2MGNhOGZiNjE5MjQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan laughed, much to Maeryn’s disgruntlement. “You’ve only been asleep for about ten hours, Maeryn,” he assured her, before reaching into one of his pockets and pulling out a bag of trail mix and offering it to the hunter. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwMzU5NjRmZWEzYzQwYWM5MTBmZmUxN2JkYTJkNjky"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn almost snatched it out of his hands - her stomach would not be denied. Wolfing down two mouthfuls of trail mix, she realized how frantic she was acting and blushed in embarrassment. “Thanks,” she mumbled. “Sorry. I don’t know why I’m so… so hungry right now. I feel like I haven’t eaten for a week or something.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzYmU2YzVmYzc2MzRiOWQ5NTEzNmMwN2ZjMzk3OGVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s to be expected,” Terrance told her reassuringly. “But before I explain that, how’re you feeling? Besides ravenous, I mean.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyN2Q5ODU0YmU4NzRlZDA5ZmU3ZWZjN2ZjYTczZjdh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn blinked, distracted by the question. “I’m… fine?” She frowned, realizing that she legitimately didn’t hurt, which shouldn’t be the case. “Wait. I feel fine. I don’t ache anywhere.” She cautiously stretched her arms, bending her elbows experimentally, and then shifted her legs one after another. She felt a bit stiff, but far and away better than she had expected to after overdoing it so badly yesterday. “I’m… healed? How?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhNDY5ZGMwNDZhYzQ5ZGFhZTYxMDc2ZGI5ZmJlYjA1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan’s grin was triumphant. “Ernesto cast </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vitality Boost </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">on you while you slept. He had a theory - and I agreed - that the strength and stamina regeneration would also apply to your body’s natural healing. At least to some extent.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNzYzOGM1NTcyZTRmYTVhODUyMGNlMDA3MGE3MWFi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I never would have thought it,” Terrance muttered, shaking his head. “Necromancy as healing. Just… wow. That’s going to take a while to wrap my head around.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzOWRhMGNhOGI5MDRjNzM4OTIwYTVhYjYyYWQ3ODEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Super-healing in exchange for being hungry enough to eat my weight in meat. Now there’s a bargain,” Maeryn muttered. “That’s it. I swear, I’m going to learn that spell from Ernesto. I don’t even care if it’s necromancy. By the Unending Depths, it’s too damn useful.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiOWIzNmRhNjRlODRiZWVhODc5NzllNTkyMTBjNTQx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan looked over his shoulder at a figure that Maeryn couldn’t quite see. “Told you.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlMDM0ZTZkOTE3YzRlNGU5NDVkNjk1MDA2YzdmNTM0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, you did,” Ernesto agreed, coming into view and standing slightly behind Dan. “I’ll teach you the basics later. I promise.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzNWZiOWUzYjJiODRhZjk4ZjBkYjYzZGRhMzJhNTk1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ernesto. Thank you,” Maeryn told him, meeting his gaze and trying to convey her sincerity. “I really, really appreciate it. Both the healing and the offer to teach me.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM1MzI3MzIwNGUyNDQzZDhiMmY4YjJkYTBjYWQzYTdi"><span style="font-weight: 400">The necromancer blushed and looked away. “It was the least I could do,” he muttered bashfully. “You hurt yourself to save us, and… well, I had the power to help. So I should.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMxYzAyMTNhNjBhMzQ0NDBhODI2MzdiY2NiYjVmOWFm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maeryn! You’re awake!” Frankie’s voice rang out, and the engineer muscled her way past Terrance to look over her friend with her own eyes. Peter trailed behind her, watching with bemusement as Frankie casually invaded Maeryn’s personal space. She poked and prodded at Maeryn’s arms and legs before standing back, making small noises of approval when Maeryn didn’t flinch or make any noises of discomfort. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyOTcxYjNkYjM2NTQ3YTU4OWM0NGViNmZiNDE2NDhl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn rolled her eyes, tolerating her engineer’s inspection with grace. Frankie always had been someone who needed to check the physical condition of things for herself - it was part of the reason why she was so good at steam engineering. But when Frankie began puppeteering Maeryn’s arms to check her range of motion, Maeryn decided that enough was enough, gently tugging her limbs back. “I’m fine, Frankie. I promise.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5YWIwZWY0MzFlNjRjZjFhNDg5YmY5OWEzYTQwMDBh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Frankie froze, then reluctantly stepped back. “Okay,” she conceded. “Just… don’t hurt yourself like that again, please?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYjZkM2JiNmQ3NDQ2YmJhYWJhZjZmZTRhODI3ODY2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll try not to,” Maeryn agreed, then finally got to her feet, bracing herself for pain that never came. That was a much welcome change from the previous night. “Okay. So. We need to come up with a plan. The ZRC isn’t likely to give up on us, and Stonewing</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">is guarded for sure. We can’t stay on the streets forever. We need to decide if we’re going to make a break for the airship and fly away, if we’re going to stay on Zephyr and try to wait things out, if we’re going to investigate Samuel Parlor’s death… I need options and opinions, people. What do you have?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM1N2Y1MzJkNDg4OTQ5YTRhZGU5Y2IwMjlhNzMxZTY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We need to get out of Zephyr,” Terrance immediately suggested. “Find a place where the ZRC doesn’t have a lot of control, and hole up there for a while. Dan and Ernesto have everything they need to continue their progress on inverting necro mana. As much as I hate to suggest it -” and he grimaced, the words obviously tasting bitter in his mouth, “- we might be best off going back to Cloudreach. I’m pretty sure we could talk Lorn and Dreen into letting us stay in the noble district like the rest of the mana researchers. Sipund wouldn’t like it, but he can jump off the city for all I care.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlYzkxYjJjNzg1NDRhYzdhNWU4MzkwNmMyYTkyOGNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The trick there is actually getting to our airship,” Dan interjected. “There is no chance that it’s not under heavy guard at this point. And after Maeryn’s display yesterday, they’ve probably taken precautions against a repeat performance. I’d bet good money that Stonewing’s been moved somewhere.” </span></p><span class="cjRjZjg4MzEzNDkwNTRhODU4OTRhYWZjNzdkZTRhYTFj"><br/>This content has been misappropriated from Royal Road; report any instances of this story if found elsewhere.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM1NDc1NWFmODJiYzQwNDdhYTNlMDIyOGI4ZTRiZTM0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What if - and hear me out - we steal somebody else’s airship?” Terrance suggested, a glint in his eye. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxYmEwY2Y0ZjlhNDQwZmU5OWYyNDA2MzBjYzUyZDY5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No way!” Frankie denied categorically, folding her arms confrontationally. She opened her mouth to continue, but was immediately cut off by Peter. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiNzkzODJlMzg3YjQ2NzNiNWFmMTdjNjU5NmI0ZGFi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s not that simple,” Peter agreed with the primary engineer with a grimace, and they exchanged nods. “While there’s a lot of standardization in airship design, there’s not many that are suited to our crew size. There’s personal ones, fitting one to three people. Too small for us, obviously.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZGYzOWNlZTYwZDQzNmY4NGJiYTlkNzY1MmM0NjQ1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Obviously,” Maeryn echoed. “And there are larger ones for shipping, right?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYTFlYWI3YTJlYzQyYTE5MDgzMTJkNTU0Y2M2ZDJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right, but those require a crew of dozens to keep working, which makes those no good either,” Frankie explained. “Stonewing’s an unusual size because it’s not specialized towards the most common airship uses, and only needs one or two engineers to keep everything going. Noble families might have one or two, but they’ll be under private security and I can’t see how we’d get away with stealing them.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjYWEyM2ZhZDU1OTRlNTJiYWJlYTkzNDY2ZGUxMjQ4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance folded his arms, scowling in frustration. “We’ll be chased regardless, wouldn’t we? Stealing our own ship or someone else’s. Private security will be less prepared than the security around our airship now, right? If everything else is the same, go after the one with less protection. That’s basic rogue thinking, and right now we’re in rogue territory.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0ODdhYTc5YjQ0YzQ3ZGJhOWFkM2NiYzExMzYyNTI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We might not be chased if we get our own airship, though,” Maeryn spoke up. She quickly told them about the note from Marshall she’d received, the one warning her to run. “If we got our own airship back, we might be able to count on some support from Marshall to delay pursuit. Long enough for us to get away.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3YjEyM2U0ZTc0NjQzZDVhNDZiMGQxZTM1ZTk4Mzgw"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a pause as all of them digested that. “So, what I’m hearing,” Ernesto said quietly, “is that we need a place to stay undetected while we figure out the situation with Stonewing. Once we know where it is, and how it’s guarded, we can set up a plan to steal it back. Once we’ve escaped Zephyr, we go to Cloudreach, and go into hiding.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NGNiMmE0NzI5YzQyMjZiODI3YTgzNjU0ZWQ4NGE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That about sums it up,” Maeryn concurred. She frowned in discomfort, not quite able to meet Terrance’s eyes; she had an idea, but it didn’t sit right with her. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjNjkwNmFhOWQwZDQ3ZjNiZGZmYzM1MTNhMjc3NWUw"><span style="font-weight: 400">The rogue, perceptive as ever, picked up on it. His eyes narrowed. “You’ve thought of something, Maeryn. What is it?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3MDVkZDQ5ODM2YjQ5NmU4NDMwYWFiZjI2ODJjZDdl"><span style="font-weight: 400">She hesitated, biting her lip, then closed her eyes, resigning herself to saying it out loud. “Terrance… Do you think we could make it to your old family home?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM2OTE2MDk3OTk3MjRhNzhhNTdiMDk2MzhlY2NhNDA0"><span style="font-weight: 400">The air in the room seemed to freeze for a moment before Terrance straightened, clenching his fists. “You…!” he began angrily, before cutting himself off. Maeryn could almost see the wheels turning in his head as he processed the question, as he realized the potential benefits of returning to the Nightshade estate. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwNDc3ZTNlN2JkZjRjYWM4MjA4NTI5YmNmODhkMjQ4"><span style="font-weight: 400">But others were far more vocal in their rejection. “Maeryn!” Frankie exclaimed, one hand flying to her mouth as she stared in utter disbelief at her friend. “Why in the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">abyss </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">would you ask that?!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMGMwMTkyNDg2YjRiYjM4NTE3MjY5ZjY2NjA1NWNm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn took a deep breath, trying not to flinch under the way the crew was looking at her, and began to list out her reasons. “The ZRC doesn’t know that Terrance is a Nightshade, so it’s a place they won’t think to look. It would provide shelter and a place to rest.” Then she nodded at Terrance, who was looking at her with a guarded expression that he’d never directed at her before. That hurt, but Maeryn gritted her teeth and continued. “Terrance would also be at least a little familiar with the area. I’d be shocked if there weren’t resources in the area that were designed for Nightingales, which could be helpful for us planning a heist.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM2NTg5MjM5Yzc5YzRjNWNhMWIwMjZiOTIzZDBmODJh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn’s words left the group quiet for a long moment. Dan’s expression was distant, obviously processing her arguments and looking for counterarguments. But everyone else looked at Terrance, waiting for him to reply, to rebut, to do anything besides stand there wordlessly. Clearly, the decision was up to him. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiODdlZDQ5ZDhjYjQ3OThiNWY5YjE0YmQ3N2EyZDFk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“But… he’s never been home,” Frankie whispered, a rare note of helplessness in her tone, as her hands tugged against each other as if looking for something stable to grasp but finding only themselves. It was the only thing she could say, the only fragile defense against Maeryn’s cold logic. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5MmVhODE2ZGNhNjRhNDY4MGMwNzRkOGYxNjhjNTE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn flinched, resisting the urge to take a half-step back. She knew it was a cruel idea. Terrance had obviously never been back to his family estate after being stranded on Cloudreach. To force someone to confront their trauma, especially something so formative and life-defining… it couldn’t be anything but cruel. She closed her eyes for a moment, regret tasting bitter on her tongue, before she replied. “I know. But I don’t see another way.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OTNhZjM4YTEyNTRhZTE5NDI2MmQxMjJiZmNkMTg0"><span style="font-weight: 400">The silence stretched on as Terrance visibly processed Maeryn’s suggestion, his face flickering through microexpressions that were almost impossible to parse, and the Geovan resisted the urge to fidget. If Terrance said no, then Maeryn would try to think of something else. But she knew he wouldn’t. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwYjYyOTc4MWVmNTQ4ODQ5ZTM1MGNmN2JkYTRhMTAw"><span style="font-weight: 400">He was too analytical. Too pragmatic. Too willing to wade into unpleasantness for the sake of doing what was necessary. He’d demonstrated that repeatedly, from all of his help back on Cloudreach, to reluctantly parting with them on Airspire, all the way to forcing Maeryn to confront the painful reality that she had to focus on the mission to end the Mist just the day before. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDgwMzM1NWQ1ODQ5Yjc4N2E3NGNkNDJiNDdkNTll"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance took a long, shuddering breath, his face tightening, his fists clenching hard enough that Maeryn half-expected to see him draw blood from his own palms. But Maeryn could see it in his eyes - he’d made the decision that Maeryn knew he would inevitably make. Terrance would choose to return home, regardless of how much it pained him. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwYjJhMjVkYjFhMzRhYjJiNDVkNzAzYTgzMGMyNmEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s… the best option we have,” he finally gritted out, his voice thick with emotion and lacking any of the smooth, playful confidence he usually portrayed. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTU4Mzc0N2FhNzQxN2ZiMDEyYzkyZjdiOGNlMTY4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn was right. And she hated herself a little for it. “I’m sorry,” she whispered, reaching out with one hand as if to convey her regret. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiN2JkYTNlOWUwYzQ1NGNhYWUxZGNkNzZkYmUyY2Uw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t!” Terrance snarled viciously, his face twisted into undeniable anger as he turned on her. “Don’t talk to me right now. I know you’re right, I know that it’s the right move, and I know that I’ll eventually get over it, but right now?” He lowered his voice, and Maeryn flinched at the intense hatred that coated his next words. “I can’t stand the sight of you.” He turned on his heel, his normally graceful movements stiff and tense, and started walking away. “Come on. Let’s get this over with,” he finished bitterly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MWY2NzY3MTc1MTRkYzI4ODNhM2VlMmUyOWYxOTNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn’s arm fell, and she looked down at the ground, unable to muster the courage to meet anyone’s gaze as she fell in line behind the rest of them. They trudged along in silence, and Maeryn made certain to stay in the back. She couldn’t bear, in that moment, to have their eyes on her. Watching her. Judging her. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlNjMwNTEwNjc2MDQ1ZmY5N2QxYzcyZWM0YjJmNTFk"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no better choice. It was the best of bad options. She knew that. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1YmFkZTRmYTFlNTQwMDE4NmE5OTBkYzQwNjdiNmZl"><span style="font-weight: 400">But that was cold comfort at best. The best of bad options was still a bad option. And it still felt like failure.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NWEyYmUxYjE2ZTRlMmI4NTQwMzExYzM3NDM0NmIy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Was this what it meant to lead? To be their Captain? To make the hard choices and bear the burden of resentment when necessary? </span></p>
<p class="cnM4MTk0YjA4ZTUzYjRmYTM5ZTgxMmQ5YTg4Zjc2ZTFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">… Maeryn had never felt more unqualified. </span></p>
