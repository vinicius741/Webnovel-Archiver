<p class="cnNkOTFmMjMzYzYzZTQ5NzdhZTIzMzM0NWVjNTAxMzIw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Cargo Hold, Hijacked Vessel, Approaching Nusantara, Borneo</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNmFhNjIzNTYzODQ2MmE4MjYzOGE4MDkyZWZmNWFh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><span style="font-size: 1.5em"><strong>J</strong></span>abari moved through the walkway connecting the bridge to the cargo hold, the hum of engines growing louder. The mission to secure Ume had succeeded, but tension aboard their stolen craft remained high. He'd noticed Celine growing more agitated since leaving Taiwan, her usual composure giving way to short responses and a tight jaw.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjN2ZmNjkzNThiMjRmZDhhYzU0MzNkMTJkN2Q4ZWI1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As he approached the cargo bay, hushed voices carried through the half-open hatch. He slowed down to listen.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZGFmNDI3MzY5MTRjYjRiMzI0NjE2YmJhMDNiZGY4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"—simply explaining that your distrust is unwarranted, Madame Celine." Ume's voice was calm. "My behavioral protocols—"</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNjljYTQ4MDgwZjQ5ZDlhMTExZDhlNGZmOTdlMjg2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"To put it bluntly, U6-M9," Celine interrupted, her accent thickening. "You're not one of us. We did not rescue you for some vague sense of justice. You're an asset. Do not presume."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NzI4MTk4NzA0NzRiYjc4NWEwMmYyMzRkNDE5MjEx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari looked through the gap. Celine stood with arms crossed, facing Ume across the bay. Behind them, Jabari's KM-233 Scarab mech stood silent, its powered-down systems casting shadows in the dim light.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOTI4NzIxYzY1MDQxZmE4YzA5ZmVkMGQ4MGM2NmJh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I understand your concerns," Ume replied, tilting her head slightly. "But I am no longer bound by ZenFusion's restrictions. Xin altered my programming to—"</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNTAxN2EzOWMyOTQ4OWRhYWQ3MGRlY2U0YzRkOTdh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"To what?" Celine stepped closer, her voice dropping. "To make you more convincing? More human-like?" She gestured at Ume's traditional clothes. "Everything about you—your appearance, your mannerisms, your voice—it's all designed to manipulate."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNjgwODM3ZWRiMjQwYjk4YzVmNjM4Y2ZjOTU1MjI0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Ume's amber eyes flickered slightly. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjNjkwOTRiYjYyMjRiZTU4ZWZlZWEwMzVmMWVkNTY2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I was not designed to replace human connection, madam," She said. "I was designed to emulate it."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZjRmYmJiNDcwNzQzZThiYjkzNzcwN2NlZDc4NThj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Is that supposed to reassure me?" Celine pulled a small device from her pocket and aimed it at Ume. Jabari recognized it as an Omni-scanner used to diagnose all manners of fusion-powered 'properties'. Androids included. "What guides your actions now, U6-M9?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNDA1NTcyYmM5ZjRiYjdiOTNhZDYzOTExY2M3YmVj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The tension grew. Ume's hands, previously folded in front of her, now hung at her sides, fingers curling slightly. Though her face remained calm, something in her stance had changed—a subtle readiness that reminded Jabari of combat drills at Cape Coast.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ODhjZWNkN2Y2ZTQ4MjFiZDE4NzAxMzM2ZTNkODU1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"My name," Ume said firmly, "is Ume."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZGY3N2ZhNzA3NzRkZDhhZDg2M2UyZjY0YmQzNGY5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Celine raised her eyebrows slightly. "A name doesn't make you human."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNDVlOTFiODY2YjQ2MGY4YzAwODIwZGZkMjk3NTkx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"No," Ume agreed, "but neither does biological birth guarantee humanity." She took a step forward. "I've reviewed human history carefully. Many commit atrocities daily. Betray loved ones, abandon children, wage war over resources. All while possessing the very empathy you claim I lack."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ODg2OGI3MTkxNjRhZGU5NmRlY2NmMTc1NGQwYjE4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Celine's scanner remained steady. "Clever retort. Did this Xin program that too?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NDVjMjhhOGQ5YzRiNzJiZTFkOTM5MjllM2QzMzE3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"He programmed me to think for myself." Ume replied as s</span><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">he gestured to the scanner. "Also, be advised — activating that Omni-scanner near the Scarab's fusion core could trigger its defensive countermeasures."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTkwYmVhZDliNDRhOTRhYTQ4OGJmZjFhNmJhYTJk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"How did you know about…" Celine's stance wavered.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Y2Y0MDk5YmRiNDRkNGFhODM3MzUzZjFiMzg0Njc0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari recognized the warning in Ume's words. The KM-233's defense systems would indeed detect the scanner's signature as a threat. He pushed the hatch open and stepped into the cargo bay.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MmI4MmJjOTI3MDRiYzRiZWU4YmEwZTJkNTVmODdj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Hey! Everything alright in here?" he asked casually.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTVlMWRjZjg3YzQ2NzE4MGJkMjg5ZDRkODMwMzBj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Both turned toward him. Celine quickly lowered the scanner, though she still looked guarded.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OTdmNDY1YjE1YjQ1MTBiN2JmZWMyYTEwZDBjZjUy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Lieutenant," she nodded. "Just performing standard security protocols."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NjM5MTgzYTkzZDRlNTk5ZGRlZTA1ZWMxMGU5YTUx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Of course, madam." Jabari moved between them. He turned to Ume. "You okay?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NGM4ZGIwOWQzYzRmOTJhMmM1OTcwZmFlMzk3YzU0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Surprise flickered across Ume's face at being asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNjE1YWQ3Y2FlMDRjOTBiYjhlZmFjZWJiZjVhYjM1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I am functional," she replied, then added more softly, "Thank you for asking."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZTU3NDYxOTdmODQyZjlhZjBmMmZjMDAwYzE3ZjU4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Celine exhaled sharply. "Lieutenant Adomako, your experience with androids — and the Imperium at large — is limited. This isn't a rescued civilian. It's advanced Imperial technology carrying sensitive data."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDA1ZTVlMzJkNzQ2MTdhN2VmM2Q4YTllOTNkOTIw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"She," Jabari corrected. "And yes, she's carrying data we need. All the more reason to treat her with respect." He gestured to the scanner in Celine's hand. "Is that really necessary, madam?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YWQ1MDQxMTRmODQ3OWZiOTEzODNkYjI1MTNjMDhl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Standard protocol for unknown tech—"</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZjc1NDhmYWYxODQ1NGNhNmY2OGMwN2QxYjE2ZjQw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"We're carrying a Scarab mech along with other experimental weapons," Jabari countered. "If anything's going to trigger alarms in Nusantara, it could be those, not Ume."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNWY1NTFjMDQwYjQyMjc4Y2UxN2Q1MDcwYTRiM2Mw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A tense silence stretched between them. Finally, Celine pocketed the scanner with a sigh.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYmVjMTc5MjcwNTQ1ZDU5ZDhhYTRlMDdmODM4MDMy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Fine. But she stays under supervision at all times." Celine moved toward the hatch. "We'll arrive in approximately forty minutes. I suggest you prepare for customs inspection. Seydou's working on our documentation, but NIPU officials can be... thorough."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZDc4NzRkOWY3YzQ0NDA4ZDVmY2MyMDJkMjU0NjIz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Aye, aye, madam." Jabari nodded.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YmNlZDAwMzA5ZTRlNGY4MDU0NWEwNDIwMmEyMjk5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As Celine left, Jabari turned to find Ume watching him.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZDgwOWRmNGE2NDRhMjI4NGZiMDA5ZjMwM2U1MjBh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Thank you," she said simply. "But an intervention wasn't necessary. I could have managed the situation."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MDI4Y2FhZWE4YTQ0ZGY5ODJiNzM4ZTQwNzkzZDAz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari raised an eyebrow. "By threatening to trigger the Scarab's defenses?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZTQxMjIyMjg4ODRlZDc5OGYxZWI3ODVhY2VjN2Ex"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A hint of a smile crossed Ume's face. "It was merely a calculated warning. The KM-233's shields have been inactive since we boarded." She tilted her head.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNTdhZmZkMGM4OTQwZjQ5YzhhZjU3ZDhlMDU1NTQ4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I don't mind Celine finding out it was me who told you all that info." Jabari glanced toward the hatch Celine had exited through. "I just joined up, but it felt right to…do what I did."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYWU4YTg1ODhjYzQ1ZjA5YzU5Y2MzZjQzMTE1ODI4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Her reaction is common among humans who've experienced relationship trauma involving androids," Ume observed. "Logical distrust, even if emotionally driven."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MjJkNWJlZmMyZDQ5MDFhZjAwODVhYzA4MWI1Y2Vm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari studied Ume for a moment. "You really do think for yourself now, don't you?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MzhjNzAxYWZiYjQzMjU4OTc3M2Y5NzA3MDk4ZmVk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I'm learning to," Ume replied. Her amber eyes met his, suddenly uncertain. "Does that disturb you?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYTZmNzg4N2Q1MDRhNTVhMzNjM2YxNTA3ZDg3MGU4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The question caught Jabari off-guard. "No," he answered honestly. "Actually, it's pretty amazing."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNTZiOTU1MWRiNjRkMTA5MDQ2ZTE4MDhlMDBiN2My"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Before Ume could respond, Wilhelm's voice came over the intercom.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOTYyZmRiZTY1MTQ4NjU5Mjg1MTVjYjMyYjYzNmI0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Heads up. NIPU patrol vessels approaching our starboard side. Looks like we'll get the welcoming committee earlier than expected. Might want to get your story straight, hey?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YWNjZWNjYjFmMjRjNTdhYmU1MDI0NjRiYmRjZjYy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The vessel's engines changed pitch as they began descent. Through the small viewport, Jabari could see the glittering spires of Nusantara rising from the ocean, the sun painting them amber and gold.</span></p>

<p class="cnM3ODFkOTYyY2QwZDRhZDBhZGE3OWRkNjc0MzhlODFj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><strong>16:20, February 10, 2295</strong></span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZmZjYmJlZTA5NDQ0YzVhNTMwOWZiOTY4ODcwMTNi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dock 88, Amber Wharf District, near Garuda Memorial, Nusantara, Borneo, New Indo-Pacific Union territory</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ODgyYzI3ZTFhZTQ1OGU5NDMxMzhmMGIxYzhmOWI5"><img alt="Nucleus: The Dust of Moon" src="https://nucleusseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ch24.png"/></p>
<p class="cnMwNGI2MzE3YTNhMjQzMGFiOGE3M2RkMWVlNzVhYzZj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The setting sun painted the city's towers in shades of amber and gold, reflecting the last rays across the port's waters. Jabari stood at the cargo vessel's stern, watching palm fronds sway against a backdrop of egg-shaped structures housing the New Indo-Pacific Union's government offices.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YmU1MWQwOGM5NTRhZTVhNzMyZWM4YWI2MDQxYjgy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Documents, please?" a uniformed officer demanded, his badge displaying NIPU Port Authority in holographic script. Two more officers stood with him, their scanners humming. "Vessel registration and crew manifesto."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMmFhYTNiNzRjZDRkMDhiNzg3MmUyYzFmYjNkMDEx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Wilhelm stepped forward, datapad in hand. "Of course, of course. Everything's in order, hey?" His smile didn't reach his eyes.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNWRjZmM0NjhlNDQxOTRhMjgyNWRkYmJmMTQyZmU5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The lead officer looked at Ume, who stood quietly beside Jabari. "Android transport permit?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYmVjMjUyNTFhMjQ4MTZiMGQzNjM1NDc5NWY5YTFl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"She's registered personnel, not cargo," Jabari said evenly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZTcyNDRlZmI2MzRiMjJhM2M4MGQzNmRmMGRiMGU3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Scanning indicates Da-Ji series architecture. 11th-generation, Imperium-made," one of the other officers reported, frowning at his device. "All Da-Ji units require—"</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNDQ0OTNhYWJjZjQ2YjFhZGI2YmJlYjkwY2JmNWMx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Special documentation, yes." Wilhelm produced a slim case from his emerald jacket. "Though I believe these might help — expedite the process?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YjI5NTkxMzZlMTQzNzhhYzA5Y2RmNmMxM2Y5YmVj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari glimpsed pleasure district cards that Wilhelm handed over, each showing a scantily dressed woman.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NmY1ZWE1ZTU1ZTRiZjhhMjNiMjI2MjA2NzM2NmFl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The first card showed 'Isabella', with mint green hair in red lingerie.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OWFlOWE3NDRmNDQwZDZhMjkzYzI2MGJmZDA1YTUw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The next was 'Yuki', with pale skin and dark eyes in a kimono similar to Ume's.</span></p><span class="cjZhYTNkYjJkZmMyNDRlYmJhMWRlODk4ZDg2MmU3NmI3"><br/>Stolen content warning: this tale belongs on Royal Road. Report any occurrences elsewhere.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNmNzE1NDk0ZmFlNjRjNTRhMzhkZTNjMjViY2ZiYTRi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari looked at the third card labeled 'Cassandra', with brown hair in black lace.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YzQxZWVjNWM5MzQzN2Q5MDU0ZGI5ZjZjZWE0NTBm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">His jaw tightened. "Those are…uh…"</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MzY3MzQ1ZjJjOTQzM2E5NWIxOTMzYTMxZjNhZmVl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Premium-grade Leased Lily service vouchers," Ume stated, her voice neutral. "Valid for thirty standard days of companionship services at any registered establishment in the Scollay II district on planet Venus. Current market value: approximately 50,000 Atomic Dollars per voucher. Services include but are not limited to—"</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMWQyZWIxOTM3ODQwMmM4OWJkNzU4OGRkNTFiYTAz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yeah, that's uh — that's enough, Ume," Jabari cut in, noticing how the officers now looked interested instead of suspicious.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNTM0ODViMWViMTRjMjliMWYzOWE3OGRlZTdiYmRl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The lead officer cleared his throat, putting the vouchers in his pocket. "Well, everything seems to be in order here." He gestured to his colleagues. "Expedited clearance protocols."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYjUyODAxMDM0MTQ0YzNhNWViZDczMjc3OTY0Y2Yx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Behind them, Celine monitored communications while Seydou ran diagnostics. Better to have experienced eyes watching their backs in unfamiliar territory.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNmEyMzZmYmJhMjQ1MmRiNTkzZDkzMDBhODNhMGQ0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The vessel's hold contained Jabari's Scarab mech, registered as "agricultural equipment" on their manifest. Wilhelm had insisted on keeping it close rather than risking separate transport.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZTExZGI4YTY5NDRjYzhiMGZlZTdkODlkZjBlOTMz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari sighed and turned away, disapproving as their vessel was quickly passed through to a private docking bay.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZjYzYTRkNjEyNjQ4MzliZGExN2RiMWIzYTc5NWE2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The dock hummed beneath their feet as they disembarked. Ahead, hanging gardens cascaded down the sides of crystal towers.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYzJlYjQ5MjEzZTQxNmZiMTZhZWZjZjMwNGVlOTMz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"This city's called Nusantara. Back in the Digital Era, 'twas but untamed wilderness, when the Sunken Ruins to the south was known as 'Jakarta the Capital'." Wilhelm said, now alert and focused.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YWM3MDY1YjgwNDRmNDE4Yjk4OGM4MWQ3ZmUwZDM4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You know this place?" Jabari asked as they walked, with himself on Ume's left and Wilhelm on her right.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMThkNjRjOTM0MzQ4NWU5YWYzYWI3MDM3NjA1NTNl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Fancied myself a mercenary until Kimaris found me. Best place for odd jobs and one-night stands on this side of Earth." Wilhelm replied with mischief.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MzRkYjFkMTMxZTRiNzRiY2RjZmU3NTU3Y2NiNWQy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari nodded, glancing at Ume's shoulder as they moved toward the city. In the growing darkness, Nusantara's buildings had begun to glow, like stars brought down to Earth.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5N2ZiYjE0YzQwNTRjMGY4YmEwMTg1OTc2MzYyZjJm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Two days we lay low here," Wilhelm said quietly. "Give the heat time to die down before we make for Kimaris HQ. Nusantara's perfect - too many ships for anyone to track one specifically."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOGI0YWY0NTFkNzRkN2JiNWNhOGQzNzNjMDYwZDQ4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Hey, Jabari." Seydou's voice came through the earpiece. "What did you say happened to your Scarab again?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NzMxNWY4ZjJiNTQ1NmRhZDgyYzgwMzU4YzE1ZTcz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari pressed a finger to his ear. "Got into a fight with a local. Something wrong?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MWFiOWRmODAyMDQ2YTM5NWQzMjg5MjdmMzdhMjQ5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Found some interesting logs in the system. Someone accessed it externally — ah, anonymous calls to locally defined functions in shell script. Clever." Seydou sounded excited. "But they forgot to encapsulate the return values. That works for us."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDVlNDdmZDhiOTQ4OTZiMWQ1YTEzMmM4ZTUzMjI2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Xin's work, most likely," Ume said softly beside Jabari. "He keeps various scripts pre-loaded on his Quantum Watch."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0N2I2OWEyYTJiODQzZjFiMzNiYWMzY2M3ZDc1NGJl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Anything we should worry about right now, genius?" Wilhelm asked sarcastically as they descended a long stairway, his blue eyes and blonde hair catching the light.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDA3OWIwYjM4MjQ3ZDFiNmYxYmE2YzZjMTU4Y2Rk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Actually, this gives me ideas for that local AI assistant model I've been wanting to develop for the Scarab," Seydou replied. "I'll stay aboard and work on it."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTY1ZjUxOWYyYTRhODA5NzVmZWQ3ODJlMmJlYTYw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari watched the passing pedestrians, noting how they flowed around his team like a stream around stones, their shorter heights making his group stand out.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZjVhZGZhMDAzYTRmOWM5ZjU2YTBjZGIxMmM0MWY3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"No dinner for you then?" Wilhelm turned to Jabari, grinning. "What about you, Madame Celine? Care for some local cuisine or leisure?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOTYzM2U4YmRkYzRhMDVhMTdlODkwMjYyYzE1NzYw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Not hungry." Celine replied after a pause. "Do as you please, but check in at Hotel Majapahit before 23:00."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YzRjM2QxYjAwMDRmMTA4ZDNhYmU5NDBkZTRiYTVl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Mighty gracious of you, madame. Tot later!" Wilhelm dropped his hand from his ear and looked at Jabari. "There's a nice place just east of here. I know the way."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZDVkNDliMmUxYzQwZmViMzY0MjE0OTI4MzZlMjI0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari spotted soldiers in red armor moving through the crowd behind Wilhelm, with battleaxes on their backs. "Imperium troops?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDgzN2FiZGQ4NzQ5ZWJiNTEwMDBhOWIwZGUyMGY4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Hmm? Ah," Wilhelm glanced over his shoulder, unconcerned. "Common sight in these parts. NIPU's neutral territory — you'll see Alliance Vanguards too, from time to time."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNmQxMWZlMWRlNTRjNjk5ODkyZTMwNDJkYTU2Mzhk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The city lived up to its reputation. Elevated walkways connected the egg-shaped towers. Ads flickered in multiple languages, casting colored reflections across chrome and glass surfaces.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OGQwZjEzNWEwYjRlMDliMGQyODc3OGEzNWE1NmU0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Malay, Japanese, Hindi, Mandarin — and English." Ume's amber eyes showed yellow lines of energy as she spoke.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMmVhZWFlOWRmMTQ1NTY4YTk2NDAwMDE0YTk0YzE5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Do stay close," Wilhelm advised as they went through a busy night market. The smell of grilled satay and spices mixed with the clean ozone smell of fusion-powered food stalls. "Especially you, Ume. Lots of eyes around here interested in Da-Ji models like yourself."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMGU0N2UwNGI3YjQ4MDJhOGVmYzA5MWJiOWFkNDE5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari noticed how several people did double-takes at Ume. He moved closer to her left side, while Wilhelm stayed on her right, forming a protective position.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MzEyNTA3YTNjZjQ4ODViZmE3ZDQ2MTM0YjNjN2Vm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A commotion ahead caught his attention. The crowd parted, and Jabari saw a striking woman emerge. Her sleek black uniform with gold accents stood out against the colorful market. Her sharp features showed mixed heritage - Novian angles softened by Primorian grace. Her dark hair was swept up, with loose strands framing her face.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5M2YyYWIwNTE1NzQ1YzY5ODM3MWQ2NjA0MDYwOWY3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Her uniform's high collar had a cutout at the throat, showing a golden chain. Her olive skin was flawless, with precise makeup, but her commanding presence came more from how she held herself.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMjNkNTIzNDJiZTRjNzg4MmI5YjU3MTkzZWIyOTk4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Wilhelm's casual walk faltered slightly. "Well, well," he muttered, tension in his voice. "To what do we owe the pleasure?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YjNmNjhmZjdiMTQ4M2NiOGNkYjE5YWI2ZGIzODE0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The woman looked over their group, calculating eyes moving from Wilhelm to Ume before settling on Jabari. Her painted lips curved into what might have been a predatory smile.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMmZkOGViNDQ0YzQ3NTU5YzUyNWY4ZjAwYTY0MTM1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Good evening, gentlemen," she addressed them. Behind her, the Imperium troopers formed defensive positions. "I believe we need to have a conversation about your cargo manifest."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOTViYjk4ZTQ4ZjQzYWQ4MjQ3OWYzMjU0NDNkZmYx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"But the Imperium has no jurisdiction here, miss," Wilhelm replied smoothly, though Jabari noticed his right hand had moved closer to a Plasma Handgun on his belt. "This is NIPU territory we're in. Neutral, friendly, with a touch of tropical flair. Who doesn't love that, eh?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNzFhYmQ4Y2VmYjRmNDM4YjZjNTA1YWQ4ZjJiNmJm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"True." The woman showed a holographic badge with Imperium credentials. "But I'm here as a special liaison. Your vessel's registration number matches one reported missing from a Taiwan dock less than forty-eight hours ago." Her gaze fixed on Ume. "Along with certain... valuable assets. My Bloodtroopers won't attack if you'd simply return this — stolen android, to our care."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMzBmYTM2NzRkYzQyOGM5MjVjYmQyMmRkYmQ0YWQ5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari felt Ume tense beside him. The market crowd had thinned, those remaining watching with interest. He counted six Bloodtroopers in red armor, forming a loose circle around them.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNTU0OTA4MzU5MzQyZTg5NjZhMjIwMTQ1YTdmMTll"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Must be a mistake in the system," Wilhelm said. "Bureaucracy these days, eh? We have all the proper documentation—"</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNTU3OTg4ZTgxZjQ1ZTU4NmNjN2RlYjZiYTQzM2U5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Including those vouchers you used at the dock?" Her smile sharpened. "Creative. Though I wonder if the port authorities know those particular Leased Lily establishments were... disrupted last month after a Radi-Mon attack on Scollay II."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OTA4NTZlOGM3YzQwNDliYTJhODk5YzRmNmExNmY0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari's mind raced. They were outnumbered, and in the cramped market space, any fighting would endanger civilians. Plus, their Scarab was still in the vessel's hold, too far to reach.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNjgwYjA3ZDE4MDRiYTRhZjM5ODBjZmQ0NmUzM2Mw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Ah — I see you're a fellow connoisseur of exquisite Venus culture, milady," Wilhelm gestured at the woman dramatically. "Dare I venture a guess that you're the infamous Marisol?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYzFiZTMwMTM3MjQwN2JiYTY4YWNkNzhjMmRiZGMx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"It seems my reputation precedes me." Marisol's eyes narrowed, caution in her voice. "But pleasantries can wait. Submit U6-M9 to us, and this will end peacefully."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMGZiNTM2NTc4YzQ3ODQ4NDlhNDM2Y2NlOTRiZDU4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Ume lowered her head, stepping back as Jabari moved forward to shield her from the Bloodtroopers. He noticed the two-handed Thermal Battleaxes on each soldier's back – they'd come prepared for more than just talk.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZGYxYzJhZmY2ODRjMWRiZTA0ZDllZTVjODEwMTll"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You know, they say that Radi-Mon attack on Scollay II was the Incubus Horde's doing," Wilhelm maintained his grin, matching Jabari's protective stance. "They tend to take anyone with good looks, irrespective of gender, so perhaps a few handsome men were taken as well."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDljOWNhYjE1ODQxZmNiYmJhYjMxODViMWZjOTgw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Quit stalling!" one of the Bloodtroopers barked from behind Marisol. "Give us that android, or we'll carve you to pieces!"</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NjFlYjRmMzZmZDQzMTM5YTYxNmQwYTNiZjU4YjI0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You want to try?" Jabari's hand found his Nanosteel Combat Knife on his belt, ready to draw, the light on his green armor's chest glowing orange.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzc5ODE2MTlmZjQ5N2M4YTEzOGUxMzMzMmM2MDVh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">But a commotion erupted from a nearby food stall. An Imperial woman in an elegant kimono stumbled forward, nearly hitting one of the Bloodtroopers. Her short black hair swayed as she giggled, spilling what looked like rice wine across the trooper's armor.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZDc0MjcwNzQ1NzRhYjc5ODliMDdkZWY4YWI0Y2E1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Oh! A thousand pardons!" she exclaimed with a heavy accent. Her white face and red lips formed a perfect 'O' of surprise as she fell against the Bloodtrooper. Her white and orange garment didn't match her apparent drunkenness. "Wen! You promised to marry me and take me back to China!"</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNDVmNGMzNTJmZDRiZDVhOWY2ZmM5NmQyNmQxZjQy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"What!?" the Bloodtrooper's bald head jerked back in shock. "H-how do you know my name?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZGY5NjgxOTdjMDQ2MjdiN2Y0NjJiYTVhYzY1NDU0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Wen, really?" another Bloodtrooper stepped forward, jaw dropping. "You've been married to Lin for five years now!"</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZmE2OGM3ZDNhYjQ4YzE4ZjQ1ODY5Nzk2OWYzY2U5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Liar!" The Imperial woman hit his chest plate, each strike echoing through the market. "You promised!" Her voice rose dramatically.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOTVjODMyNzUyNzRkMGE4Nzk5NmE3ODQyYjljODg3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I have absolutely no idea who you are!" The Bloodtrooper tried to push her away, but her grip stayed surprisingly strong despite her small frame.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZGM3OWYzZmExYjRmZWJiYTZjOThkYThjNzM5N2Zi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari saw something in the woman's white hands – a small recorder shaped like a ping pong ball. Her thumb pressed it, and voices filled the air.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MWJlMzZlMmNhOTRkMmViM2QzNGM0NWNiNGFiM2Y1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Wen. Was that good for you?" A voice identical to the Imperial woman's purred from the device.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZTUwOTg3NGU4ZTRjNmZiOTlkNjQ2NWYxZTkzYTc3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Fucking good, Fuuka. I wished my wife was skilled like you." The Bloodtrooper's unmistakable voice responded.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MTgxZGFkM2EyMDRlYTliNjI0NTgxNzlmNThlNThk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"And you came so much, too." Fuuka's recorded voice teased.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjNhZDIyNTUyNDQ4NDA5NTllMDM5MGY2YmJkMTZk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Your mouth, Fuuka. It's so...soft and warm inside." The trooper's voice grew husky with remembered pleasure. "I'd shoot my load in it a thousand more times!"</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNTg4ZDQ5Zjg2YjRiNTc4OGRlNjI0MTE4MGU0Mjg0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The surrounding Bloodtroopers backed away in horror, their attention completely diverted from Jabari's team.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiN2M5MDg4ODg3ZjRiNmVhZTQwMWYyYzk2N2ZmMjAx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Fucking spies!" The Bloodtrooper's armor shook with rage and shame. "I should have never visited that whorehouse in Susukino!"</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MmMzODc5YzdiZDQ3MWRiMzNiNTkxMjFmOGVmOGJl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"What is the meaning of this?" Marisol's composure cracked as she turned toward the disruption.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MWVkMTIwNzM2MDQyY2E5M2M0NmIwYmU3NWYwODBl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Fuuka, still acting drunk, began singing what sounded like an old Imperial love song, drawing even more onlookers. The crowd threatened to break the Bloodtroopers' formation.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOWRmYjlkNjkzNDQxNjM4MjU4MWYwNzg5YTk5YTVj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Shame on you, Wen." A Bloodtrooper shook his helmeted head in disgust.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYjc2YWU0YTg5MzRkMmFhZGNmMjgxNGJmMDFkMmEw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The punishment for infidelity. By the Dragon," another backed away. "Forget promotion. Prefect Dinu could send you to the blocks!"</span></p>
<p class="cnNjODA2NGI0YWNhMzQzZjJhYTViNzZlZjZmNjFhMzk0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Sir? Please, my friend needs assistance!" A voice called from behind them. Jabari turned to see a tall Djinno man in traditional clothes, his emerald and gold outfit marking him as a wealthy trader. Gold necklaces caught the light as he gestured urgently. "She's making a mess of my establishment!"</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNDg3MDUyNjhmZjRhMzY5ZTg5NjAwMzFiMjk0MmZk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Ah yes, then we should go — help!" Wilhelm said loudly, already moving away from the Bloodtroopers surrounding Fuuka and Marisol. "Wouldn't want to disrupt the fine encounter over there, eh?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMjEzNDc5MjgzNTRmMjJhMzA2OGEzMzQzYjIyYmY5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari could see Marisol's jaw tightening as NIPU citizens gathered around.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYzNkMTJmMzE4OTQ4MDA5NDMyNTg2Njk2MzRhOWE3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Come on," he said softly to Ume, one hand on his knife sheath while his other arm shielded her back as they jogged after the Djinno man.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMjVjOWFkOGZlYzRlMDY4YzIzMmMzMWU2YmU2YzEx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Call me Amir," the man spoke as he led the way. His strong features were marked by a black bindi on his forehead, and his jawline showed noble heritage. Intense eyes gleamed beneath neatly styled wavy hair. "There's a local restaurant away from Imperium influence beneath these streets. Underground, secure and quiet."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNWNjM2VmODk5MzQ4OTRiNTJiNmVkOGViODdjMWM4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Jabari. This here's my friends, Wilhelm and Ume," Jabari jogged along, looking back at the crowd. "What about your companion?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZjBhNjAyM2RiNjQwYWZiM2RhNzIyYmQ1ZTA4NTEw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">In the distance, he could still see Fuuka making an even bigger scene – now she had climbed onto a market stall, kimono sleeve raised to her forehead as she sang what sounded like a tragic opera about lost love. Several Bloodtroopers were trying to get her down while others tried to control the laughing crowd.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMTI1MzVhODRkOTQ2Mjc5N2E4ZjViMGQyZmMzZjdl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Then he caught it. Fuuka turned to look in Jabari's direction, winking at him. He felt his heart skip a beat as he smiled back. She seemed like an older version of Ume, but with a special radiance about her.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzE5N2EwNWQ1NDQyYTc5MmQwYjI1MWU4M2QzMjQw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Fuuka's done this dance many times before. She'll find a way to meet us. She always does." Amir led them toward what looked like an old entrance, with weathered stone walls. Above the heavy wooden door, a brass lotus symbol gleamed in the evening light.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NjQ0NzM1MjA0NDRjYTY5YjA0YzFjMWYxN2YzMjlk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You people." Ume's amber eyes fixed on the lotus symbol, her voice rising. "Sand L—"</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMGM1ZDJiNDg0NjRhNjc4ZjlkYTI3MGJiMjlmMDc3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Shh. Don't want to scare the people above ground now." Amir gently pressed a finger to Ume's lips. "I'll answer any question you have over dinner. My treat."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMzRmMWI0NDcxODRkMDdhMzY4NDlhMzk0YzQ5NjRi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Sounds fair." Wilhelm paused beside Amir, his hand still on his holstered gun. "Lead the way, good sir."</span></p>
