  <span>
   Near Interstate 80 Border Control Station, 18945 Coldstream Road, Truckee, CA 96161, Golden State Republic territory
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dawn painted the Sierra Nevada mountains in amber and rose colors. In the Space Rover's passenger seat, Lorna ate her gravlaks sandwich, the cured salmon and dill bringing memories of Oslo's morning markets.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Her beige trench coat caught the early light, the blue turtleneck beneath contrasting against her fair skin and golden hair. The Psi Shield Device curved around her left ear, barely visible. Håkon shifted restlessly in her coat's inner pocket, warm against her chest.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Hey, Xin," she said to the engineer drinking his third cup of black coffee since they'd left Nevada. "Want a bite?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Behind them, Diego sat in his crisp black suit, holographic displays glowing blue around him. "Lorna always has a sandwich of that flavor whenever we come to the West Coast."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna turned to the backseat. "Been spying on me, Diego?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Mira, I'm a welfare committee member at our office, it's my job to ensure your well-being." Diego replied with a smile, his Novian accent warming the words.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin's beige puffer jacket rustled as he shifted in the driver's seat. Dark-rimmed glasses framed his eyes as his fingers drummed against the steering wheel, studying the approaching security gate. He glanced at the offered sandwich, then back at the road. "You know, I've never had cured salmon before."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Then you should give it a go." She held it closer. "Consider it cultural exchange."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin took the half-sandwich. His first bite was careful. But then his eyes widened behind his glasses. "I've never tasted anything quite like this!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna watched his reaction with satisfaction. "There's a small diner on Venus that serves this. Hopefully they're still open for business."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "We should make a trip there in the future, then." Xin said quietly, taking another bite, sunlight glinting off his glasses as their eyes met.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Speaking of culture," Diego said, leaning forward, "might want to see these security protocols I'm picking up. GSR's upgraded their border tech since our last visit."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Again?" Lorna shook her head as she reminisced. "When was it, the summer of '94?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That time we found a Radi-Mon while snorkeling on La Jolla Shores, yes." Diego added, stroking his chin.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   From inside Lorna's coat pocket, Håkon chirped softly, reacting to the phrase.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Through their shared psychic link, a confused flutter of emotions reached Lorna - not words, but concepts that felt like puzzle pieces searching for their place.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   <em>
    Radi-Mon-me? Same-different?
   </em>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna's hand instinctively pressed against her coat pocket, offering silent reassurance.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Holographic banners rippled above the titanium gates, their slogans rotating beneath the GSR's flag – a golden butterfly between twin stars against white. The guards wore powered armor that gleamed gold and black.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Sleek drones patrolled the perimeter, their sensors pulsing with detection fields. The guards' uniforms were identical, emphasizing authority through conformity.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Pawan," Xin whispered, adjusting his glasses. His Omni-drone emerged from his jacket pocket, hovering between them. "So, what are we looking at, Diego?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Latest quantum computing tech integrated with security protocols," Diego leaned forward. "Those drones aren't just scanning for weapons – they're monitoring for unauthorized quantum signatures, unregistered psionics, anything that could threaten GSR sovereignty."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Håkon stirred more urgently, pressing against Lorna's chest. Through their connection came a sharp pulse of unease - danger-scent-metal-wrong. She placed a hand over her coat pocket, trying to soothe him, but his agitation was growing. "And how do they handle Alliance operatives?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Technically, we're supposed to have automatic clearance under the Mutual Defense Treaty," Diego muttered. "But lately..." He trailed off as a guard approached their vehicle.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The guard's powered armor gleamed in gold and black, its plates suggesting both strength and precision. Her helmet reflected the rising sun. "Documentation and purpose of visit."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That won't be necessary, amiga." Diego's voice filled the cabin. "I am Diego Rodriguez of the Alliance, and I've already transmitted full authorization codes for my team's mission yesterday. You should have received —"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Authorization invalid," the guard declared. "Our systems don't recognize foreign military clearance without explicit approval from the Chief Executive."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Then I'd kindly request that you inform him as soon as possible, por favor." Diego's voice mixed civility with insistence.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Stay put." The guard held up a hand as her colleagues worked in the background, typing on terminals with multiple display screens.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A moment later, the border station's massive screens flickered to life, showing an imposing figure.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Alexander Reeves. Of course." Lorna smirked. Throughout her years in SIMU, Lorna had met Reeves several times, though few pleasantly. The man was never friendly to anyone, except those useful to his political advancement.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The GSR leader's golden suit gleamed like captured sunlight. His silver-white hair was swept back with military precision, while his sun-bronzed features and piercing eyes spoke of a man used to wielding absolute authority.

 </span>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Diego Rodriguez. Stardust International Mobile Unit." Reeves addressed the hologram, his voice carrying the practiced warmth of a career politician. "I wasn't aware the Terra Alliance had interests in California anymore. Ones that'd require such specialized personnel." His eyes flickered to Lorna.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Håkon's consciousness brushed against hers with sudden intensity. The young Diabolisk had somehow sensed the shift in atmosphere, his thoughts flowing like warning bells:
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   <em>
    Bad-man-screen-mother-tense-careful.
   </em>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It's been some time, Chief Executive Reeves!" Diego acknowledged, waving and nodding with a grin. "My team needs to conduct time-sensitive research at Stanford Psi regarding a certain Nirboh artifact. I've forwarded the full briefing yesterday —"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yes, I've read your documents," Reeves cut in smoothly. "The Golden State Republic maintains strict sovereignty over its academic institutions. Any foreign investigation must be conducted under our direct supervision."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Against Lorna's chest, Håkon went very still – the dangerous kind of still that preceded action. Through their link came something primal and fierce:
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   <em>
    Threat-pack-protect-mother-ready.
   </em>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She kept her hand pressed firmly against her coat, feeling the young Diabolisk's muscles coiling beneath his scales.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Of course, señor." Diego replied. "We're prepared to comply with GSR protocols."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Then you'll understand when I insist your team proceeds directly to Stanford Psionic University's campus." Reeves's smile didn't reach his eyes. "No deviations, no unauthorized stops. GSR Security will escort you. Any attempt to access other locations without explicit approval will result in immediate expulsion." He paused, his gaze sweeping over the Space Rover's occupants, lingering on Lorna. "Do we understand each other?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Before Lorna could respond, one of the drones emitted a sharp tone. "Alert: Unauthorized quantum signatures detected. Unregistered biological anomaly."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The guard's posture stiffened. "Exit the vehicle immediately. All of you."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You're making a mistake—" Lorna began.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "There's no mistake. Our scanners are the finest across the Inner Sol—" The guard stopped abruptly, her golden gauntlet swinging toward Lorna. "Actually, wait! Just you, Valoran. Out of the rover!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Diego leaned forward. "Now hold on, señorita. Perhaps you could explain what's triggered the alert?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Obstruction of Law Enforcement. Another violation. Exit the vehicle for processing!" The guard's command was punctuated by her rifle powering up, its black barrel adorned with the GSR's butterfly motif.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   In the Rover, Diego bowed his head, pressing fingers to his temple.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna exhaled slowly and opened her door. The Sierra Nevada wind caught her golden hair as her boots met asphalt. Three guards approached in their fusion-powered exosuits, black rifles trained on her.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What's in your coat pockets?" one guard demanded through his helmet's speakers.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Standard SIMU equipment. Psytum Sword, 10mm Magnum." Lorna held Baldr's hilt in her right hand and extended her arm forward.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She caught Reeves's amused smile on the border station's massive display.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I meant your chest pocket," the male guard specified, gesturing while keeping his rifle steady. "Something organic in there."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Håkon's thoughts flared with indignant confusion:
   <em>
    Safe-nest-mother-warm. Not-understanding-fear-me.
   </em>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It's a baby reptile. He's family." Lorna maintained a forced smile even as her body tensed. "Just a bit shy."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Place the reptile on the net!" The third guard reached behind his armor, withdrawing a compact metal box. With a hiss, it unfolded into a mesh of black filaments, the net's edges crackling with energy.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna recognized the device. This was GSR's shock web, used to incapacitate everything from human dissidents to Radi-Mons.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A new thought flooded through their psychic link, Håkon's terror mixing with defiant courage:
   <em>
    Fear-sharp-wrong-trap-hurt
   </em>
   .
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Get Helionite in your ears? I said place the reptile on the net!" The marine's voice grew harsher through his helmet, the morning sun glinting off his golden plates.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "No." Lorna's blue eyes met the officer's faceplate.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Behind her, Xin's fingers tightened on the steering wheel. Pawan hovered closer, its sensors pulsing. "Hey!" he called out, "You can't just violate someone's personal—"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Shut your mouth!" The female marine cut him off, her rifle's black barrel reflecting the dawn light as she advanced on Lorna. "Final warning. The reptile. On. The. Net."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   From Håkon came a surge of fierce determination:
   <em>
    never-leave-mother-pack-fight-together
   </em>
   .
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I refuse." Lorna's grip tightened on Baldr's hilt.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Hard way it is, then." The nearest marine lunged forward, his gauntleted hand reaching for her coat.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   But before the man could touch her, Håkon burst from Lorna's pocket in a flash of blue, his serpentine form unfurling with deadly grace.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Radi-Mon!" Three rifles snapped up in unison, their energy cores humming to life. The young Diabolisk's crystalline scales took on a dark blue tone as he stood protectively on Lorna's left shoulder, trilling with ferocity.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Stand down!" Reeves's voice cut through the tension from the display screens. His features had lost their diplomatic veneer, replaced by cold calculation. "Agent Weiss. Mr. Rodriguez. Your file mentioned nothing about harboring a Diabolisk."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "He's my son," Lorna's voice carried steel as Håkon's warning trill vibrated against her neck. "And he's not registered because he's not a threat."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "A Radi-Mon. Your son." Reeves's laugh held no warmth, his eyes narrowing. "Did you think our scanners wouldn't notice? Or perhaps that's precisely what you wanted us to find?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Chief Executive!" Diego stepped out of the Rover, his movements deliberately slow. "If I may explain—"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What we have here is an Alliance operative, attempting to enter California with an unregistered Radi-Mon." Reeves leaned forward. "One must question the true nature of your 'research mission'."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Håkon's scales darkened as the guards tightened their formation.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Submit your Diabolisk for biological containment." Reeves continued, "It will be held in a secure facility until your — research finishes."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "We're here for the Moondust Crystal! And hot dogs. AND watching baseball. Sounds okay?" Xin's voice carried from inside the Rover, steady despite the tension.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Xin, what the fuck!?" Lorna looked back and scolded. They weren't supposed to mention the subject.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The hell's that supposed to mean?" one of the guards demanded, his exosuit whirring as he turned to face the vehicle.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I don't know. Some Imperial mumbo-jumbo?" the female guard shrugged, but her rifle remained trained on Lorna.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   In that moment, Lorna caught it - the almost imperceptible narrowing of Reeves's eyes at the mention of the Crystal. The Chief Executive's composure slipped for just a fraction of a second before recovering.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Jessie, escort these Alliance agents to the Flanders Poppy Manor," Reeves commanded through the displays. "Ensure no harm comes to them. I'll meet with them shortly."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Executive Reeves?" The female guard turned toward the screen, confused.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Do it, Jessie. Arrange the VIP lounge for our guests." Reeves's tone left no room for argument, the gold of his suit seeming to gleam brighter.
  </span>
