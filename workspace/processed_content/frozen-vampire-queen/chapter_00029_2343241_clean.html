   Silver claws clacked against a table impatiently. A woman in elegant white robes sighed for the fifth time. The Silver-General’s eyes looked up from her table, finally giving a toothy smile at an intruder.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “Lady Esverin,” Captain Gunther said, “we have the full report for you. There can be no doubts that Karlack was killed by a vampire. Moreover, the beast fled from the North with a little girl.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The woman continued to smile. The vicious canines in her mouth made Gunther shrink. Lady Esverin stood and walked over to the man, trailing his collarbone with her claws. “I know all about it. I believe the two slipped into this city. Under your noses, no doubt.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Captain Gunther swallowed and dared not speak.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The Silver-General’s eyes glowed in a warm orange color. Feathers coated the arms of her white garb, and she slowly walked behind Gunther. She wrapped her arm around his shoulder, and her silver claw trailed the center of his neck, digging in slightly to his apple.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   With a little bit of pressure, a small trickle of blood ran down his throat. Lady Esverin leaned towards his ear, her voice coming out sensually. “Do you know why this city is so peaceful, Captain?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The captain nodded as some pressure was relieved. “It’s because of the Dawn and the Silver-Masters.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “Because of the Dawn and the...That’s only partially true. This city is safe because of the blessings of our lady. The might of Her people to stand against the powers hidden in the darkness. Without Her blessing we could never clean up all of the trash.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “I know about the teachings of Lady Reimei…”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Esverin sighed and shook her head. “It seems that you know not enough. For if you had known, you’d have not let the swine into this city.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “With respect, Lady Esverin, with your power…”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Esverin dug a painful claw into his shoulder, dropping the man to his knees. “Do not be stupid. If I could have acted, I’d have done so already. The problem is the company she keeps.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Captain Gunther spoke through gritted teeth. “What do you refer to?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “I speak of a dragon, you imbecile. Have all of the ranks of the Dawn become this useless, or is it just your unit? If you don’t give me a reason for your failure, I may have to disband your group.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Captain Gunther flinched. “My Lady, please don’t be so brash. The vampire was stronger than all of those city’s guardsmen. She repelled their arrows and outran their horses. We had no idea she would come here...And what’s more with a dragon!”

   “This is why I hate all of you incompetent people. You beg those higher than you for their power when you can’t solve your own problems, and when the higher powers are rightfully angry, you tuck your tail between your legs and beg them. I don’t want to hear anymore excuses. This is a problem you created, so it’s a problem you will solve.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “But…”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Lady Esverin sighed. “You don’t need to worry. I can provide assistance where I can, but the longer we wait, the bigger this problem becomes.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Captain Gunther nodded. “And who is the dragon?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Lady Esverin smiled, her canines on full display. “That would be the queen of the moon…”
  </p>

   Emma watched Arrow nearly fall over in her plate armor. The girl strutted forwards awkwardly.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Sora grabbed the vampire’s hand. “I think it’s hard for her because of the hooves. Can’t you make armor that fits her better?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Karlack looked at the scene with entirely different thoughts. “Why does she need to be a knight though? Am I not enough to protect you, Mistress?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “It’s not like that at all,” Emma said. “It’s just that horses are always knights.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Arrow pulled up the face mask of her helmet and grinned widely at Emma. “If the mistress says that horses are always knights, then I want to be a knight.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Lunaria nodded her approval. “I see that you also hold a fondness for chess.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma’s eyes widened at the dragon’s words. “You have that game over here?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “We do. You and I should play some time. We could play strip chess.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The vampire’s face heated. “Why does it always have to be something sexual?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “Because I know that you are still reeling from yesterday. I can practically smell it radiating off of you.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma focused her mind, trying to figure out if what the dragon said was true, but there was no such thing down below. If anything, she felt painfully dry from the heat outside.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “Awe, I refer to a different smell,” the dragon said. “There are lots of ways for one to feel lust.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “Can both of you stop!?” Sora shouted and pushed her hands in between them. “This is not the time for you two to be flirting! We need to figure out how to make Arrow the most comfortable!”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma and Lunaria both stopped what they were doing and nodded obediently. Emma got to work with the ice armor surrounding Arrow’s frame. It had already taken most of her magic power to shape it, but now she needed to make it better fit for hooves.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   With no experience ever crafting anything, Emma worked on the legs and shaped the armor to better accompany Arrow’s legs. By the time she finished, Arrow released a satisfied sigh.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “This is much better, Mistress. With this, I feel like I can run through the city’s wall!”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “Great, you think you can wield Karlack? A knight needs a sword as well.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Arrow lifted her helmet again and looked towards the maid woman shyly.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Karlack shrugged and offered her hand. “I can help you with learning how to swing a sword, and you can’t be much worse than the mistress.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma frowned but chose not to say anything. The bastard sword had been right. Emma found herself more suited to using magic from a distance. Though, a new question popped into her head. What happened if all of the things she made started becoming sentient? Would Arrow’s armor become like that? Or perhaps the clothes that Emma herself always wore?
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   She looked down, and a faint glow from her outfit accompanied her thoughts.
   <em>
    I guess I’ll just have to worry about that when the time comes.
