<p class="cnMwNDBkMzEwMWIyZTRhZDlhMDc5MmNhOWI1M2FkNmI2"><strong><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">11:00, February 10, 2295</span></strong></p>
<p class="cnM4MTcxODZjNDQ3ZDQyYmJiNzRlZDFhZDU3MjE5YmU1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Azure Mount Logistics Hub, extension of Songnei Starport, No.31, Bishan Rd, Neihu District, Taipei, Taiwan, Imperium of Dragons territory</span></p>
<p class="cnNhM2U2N2MwNWI0NTRmYTNiOTM3OTQ4OWE3OTE3MmFl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari's heartbeat was the only sound in the steel container as they moved through the Azure Mount Logistics Hub. The container hid them well as it glided on the hover pad. Seydou worked on a device while Celine kept watch through a small opening.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YmY3N2IyODZhNjRjM2E4ZmNjNTNlOWExMjY2YjQ1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"High-value cargo in a shipping container," Jabari whispered. "Hope this works."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMDA1NTU1Y2Q3ODQ2ODY5NWZmOWRmMGUzZmMyYTQ2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"We will make it work," Celine said quietly. "Remember, our goal is to retrieve U6-M9 without violence."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDhhNzM0NzgyNTQyYzY4Mzc5OGRlMDI3NzA2MGY4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Through the one-way glass, the workers outside looked mechanical, focused only on their tasks.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNzYxZDdlMWJlODRmNTViYjlhM2VkYTY4YThlZDQ1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Literal forced labor. My Gyata hoverbike would have easily passed through unnoticed," Seydou commented. "Although I doubt she could fit in these small boxes."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZWU5ZDVhMGU4ODQxOGQ4M2IyZDNiYjcwMzIzNjkw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari frowned at Seydou. "Seydou, the script just doesn't sit right with me. Do we really expect these Imperial Peons to simply comply when we point a gun at them? Wouldn't they fight back?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNjM3N2UzZjE1ZTQyYWQ4MTg3OGE1ODgwOWM5Mjlj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Seydou's grin faltered. "Did my research. These Peons are usually poor folks abducted then resocialized in those internment camps on Mercury before coming to these factories. Minimal food, barely humane treatment from their Overseers –"</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NWFiNzBhMjU0NDQ1MjBhNDNhMjIzZmU5ZjhmNmY5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"That's just wrong!" Jabari's eyes widened.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYTU2ODJiZDhhNzQ3MmVhZTI1YWI2Y2ZiMGUzODhi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"They're harmless and can be made to cooperate. As long as you don't go shooting up the place." Seydou raised a hand.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDU0NzUyMWI0OTRlOWE4MzE0MDQxYzc3MDA0OTlk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Alright, cut the chatter," Celine ordered, and the container's side panel opened with a small hiss. They stepped out into the hangar and blended with the workers and machines. The workers wore worn Imperium uniforms in black and red.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4Yjg3MDQ1ZTY3YjQ4ZTlhMzQ0N2M2MGI4MTRhYzc3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari gripped his rifle and pulled it out. He stepped confidently from the container, showing his weapon.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMDM5MjA4ZWQ5MjQxYmE4NGYyZWQwMDUxMjA0MGQ2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Plasma Rifle gleamed under the dim lights, with green energy visible in its transparent chamber.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4Yjk4YTk3NzYyYTQzZmFhN2Q5ODkyZjEzYmY4NWU5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Okay. Nobody needs to get hurt," he announced. "We're here for Cargo 69."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NTk2MDJhNTZkODRhN2E4ZTY3ZWIxZDAyYjZhMWY3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A nearby Peon in stained overalls turned, fear on his face. The other workers froze.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OGZmYzc4NTliYzQ2MjJiNzdlNzQzOTY5NDQzN2Yy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Oh no, please, my lord, what have I done wrong?" the Peon begged, shaking. He knelt and raised his hands. "Please, I'll do anything! My lord, I have a wife, a son, a family to take care of. I need this job!"</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMzMzODBiZmU1YTRiZjY4ZGIzNWEzZTk2MmY2MWQ1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You have a family?" Jabari kept his rifle aimed at the Peon while looking at Celine.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZDUzZDc3NWM3ZDQ4NGFhNmM1OTE1MjYzNzIzOGFj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Likely false memory implanted to keep him going," Celine said sadly. "Imperium Peons are seen as expendable. Many undergo forced brain surgery to receive fabricated memories so they can believe they have a future."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NGQ4MDFjYjc5ZjQ2ZWRhZGYwNDhhYzYyNDc0YTcz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari sighed. "Alright. Lead us to Cargo 69. I won't shoot."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYTBiMzhiMzdmOTQ2OWFiMTFlN2IxMzZkM2Y1Njk5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Cargo 69. Right, C-cargo 69." The worker nodded nervously.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MmI4MjIyNDdiZjRkOGU4ZmNmMzJkNjBhZGQ2NzIw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yes. See what you can do," Jabari kept the gun on him, though he hated doing it.</span></p>
<hr/>
<p class="cnMxMjVhYTFhYzJhZjQxZjdiNjk3ZmQyMmYzODgzMWUx"><strong><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">11:11, February 10, 2295</span></strong></p>
<p class="cnM5MzQzNjQ3MDY3NTQzZmViMDU0NWE5NGEzY2RmZmNm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Cargo Hold 6, Azure Mount Logistics Hub, extension of Songnei Starport, Bishan Forest, No.31, Bishan Rd, Neihu District, Taipei, Taiwan, Imperium territory</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NWEyMWZiMjFhMDQyZmM4N2JiZjc1MWM3YjEwNjVm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Just a few more lines of commands — oops, they've changed the decryption algorithm — wait, the same as the Alliance's back channel password last year? You Imperials, so unoriginal. And — got it," Seydou said as his fingers moved over the terminal. The screen lit up with access granted.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZDYwYzkxNDIwMjQ0MTI5MGZkYjUwMDFiZTgwM2Q2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari watched, his rifle now holstered, as he looked at a gray container holding their target.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhODlkMjRmMjk4ODRlMGI5MDJkY2M0ZTlhZTgzN2Uw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The container opened with a hiss, revealing a woman's head through the gap.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMDVlMjQ1MWQwMjQ0NGE5ZjhlMWMyYmI0YTQ4ZDc4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari was surprised. "Oh. I thought this U6-M9 was a male."</span><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZjMzODJiOTY3MjRmZDY5YjVlNjFlNzZhYWM0Mjli"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The container now opened fully. Inside, lay an Imperial woman, her petite form seemingly untouched by time. Her eyes were closed, her face framed by her raven-black hair that was cut in a sleek bob falling just above her shoulders. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZGM3Mzc3MTYxNDQ1NDhiMTFkMmNhZmNkMmQwZDFk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The strands contrasted the exquisite paleness of her skin — a complexion like the finest porcelain. Her lips were slightly parted, as if she were merely caught in a tranquil dream. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5Y2QxMDczZGFiYTQ5NTZhYjIzNTM5NDQ3NGYxNWM5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari’s gaze continued downward, captivated by the intricate details of her attire — a traditional kimono and its golden embroidery that depicted scenes of mythical creatures and swirling clouds. The robe cinched at her slender waist with a sash that accentuated her feminine curves. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjMDI2ZDU0YWFjNzQ3ODU4Mzg5NWM4ZWVjNDNiOWM5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Her hands were folded neatly across her midriff, as delicate as the rest of her.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZmUxNjAyMDA4ZTQ3NmNhZDc5NzZkMzZjYjMxMzJj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"U6-M9," he said quietly. "A Da-Ji android, just like the ones at Maurice's shop."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMjQ2MWFhYmExNzQ2OTFhNTA5ZDc4MTRkMGIyNzk5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Her eyes fluttered open, and she took a deep breath.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNGExNjliMWQ4NTRkYzliMThkZDQxOTRmYzEzMGNi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Hey, e-easy," Jabari said nervously. "You've been asleep for a long while?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNTczOTcyNGM3YzRlODI4ZWI3YzNiYzkxY2ZjNjhh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Where…am I?" she asked, her voice confused.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOTIwNDRiZjJlZjRhY2I4NWRhNzRjMDNiYzNjMzNk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Somewhere safe," he tried to reassure her. "Can you move? We're h-here to bring you back from, umm, death I think? Y-you were slated for a mind-wipe, s-something like that."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNmJlMGVjODE5ZjRjMzhhOWE4MDgwZDY4MmFlMGQ5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Hey, Jabari, did a crocodile bite off your tongue?" Seydou teased from the background.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZjA4YzEzNzYwNjQ5N2Y4ZjgwMmY1OTBlMDc0MmFk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The woman gave a small, empty smile.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkY2RjNDM1OTRhYjRmOTU4MjA3MjZiZWM0NTYzN2My"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Mind-wipe," she repeated flatly. Her brown eyes met his. "Let it happen. I don't mind it."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMTc2YzllNmY5ODRiYjI4M2M5ODUwZmFmY2Q2ZDk3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Wait, you…" Jabari was shocked by her response. "You don't mind it. What?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OGFlZDg3NmYwYjQwZjg5Yjc4YmU1ZThmMDc1ZGZh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"There is no purpose in my existence. No place where I belong," U6-M9 said without emotion. "If I die, so be it."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOTFkNWVhOTc2MDQ1NWI5OThhMGQwNWNjZmMwNTNl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"No no, wait. Your life has value," Jabari insisted. "Your memory. Someone planted something important there. It could help us save the world. Uh, I forgot what it is."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NjlhMzNiZmFlNzQyMjA5NjRjYThlNzAyYmQ5MDVk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Moondust Crystal's location," Seydou added. "I guess they don't teach public speech at the Prep School, huh?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZDQ1ZTA3Mzk1ZjRkYWRhMWMzNzg3NjY0NmVlN2Yy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Save the world…" the android woman said weakly. "I used to have so many things to do. Now there is nothing. Why would I want to save this boring and meaningless world?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYWVmNzk3MTYyMDQyNWE5YTZmYTU2NDkzYmVhYzc2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Her hopelessness was unfamiliar to Jabari, who knew more about fighting than handling someone who had given up.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZGZiZmZkYjEyOTQxNzc5NjE5ODlhZmJmYjM0YzFj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You know, I've never seen an android as pessimistic as this one. Maybe we should give her a motivational speech?" Seydou joked while typing.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMDUwYmNiZTk2MzQ3NmQ5MzkyMGY4MTgyMTIwMDA1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I'm Jabari, and this is my comrade, Seydou," Jabari said, placing a hand on his chest. "What about you? Do you have a name?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YTdkYmRmODkyNDQ0Mjg5OTVlZWQyZmE5MTgzMWY2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Ume," the woman said as she looked at Jabari. "But I don't see the point."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNTg3MWRhMDcyYTQwNzY5ZTFiOWMxMTViNzgyN2M5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Right. Pleased to meet you, Ume," he said more firmly. "Do you have a, you know, hobby?"</span></p><span class="cjY4NWMwMTBjNmMwODRlMWFhNDYwZDM1ZGJhMWZjYTY0"><br/>This story originates from Royal Road. Ensure the author gets the support they deserve by reading it there.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNhYmQ5MjNjOWFlMDRhZTM5Yzg4OTIxYjUyN2M0YjI2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I don't understand," Ume looked confused.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNTMyYjI5OWRjNTQxNGQ4OWRhOTk3MjQ3YmUyZGU5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Anansi's ass, Jabari. She's an android!" Seydou stopped typing to stare at Jabari.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZDExN2RjZWU4MTQyZmJiZGU2MWZmYjAzNjliZTk5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"But, you know, you've got to have something. Something you do even when no one tells you to?" Jabari continued. "Like, I play the djembe drum. It's an, uh, instrument."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjODYxYTdkZmRmMzRjNDNhNjEwZWJhYjJkZDgwMmQz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I like to watch the sun. Whenever Xin went outside for work, I'd go to the windows and watch the sunlight. But it's rare to see it here in Taipei with all the rain," Ume shared, tilting her head. "Does that count?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NDI0YWU4MjUwNzRjZTA4NmVmMmY0YWVmYmFhMDEw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"It does," Jabari leaned closer, feeling they were connecting. "I come from a place where the sun shines bright. If you come with us, we can go and watch it together."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYzVhNjllYjk1MzRmODQ5MDRiNGFhODMwZTkyZDFi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"We can?" Ume asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMDkzMjI4ZmNjYjQ0YjZiNzdlYjQ2NzZlNWEwYWE4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yeah, watch the sun together," Jabari nodded.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYjVjNzBkNDhkZjQ5MTVhZDIwMGVmZmRkOGM4YzVk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Surprisingly, Ume chuckled. "You're so weird."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MWM3ZGQ4MDE0YzQ0M2ZhMDE2OGMxN2EyOTIzZTdj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yeah, I mean, uh," Jabari smiled and shrugged. "I guess I am."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YzA2ZTNhMGU2ZDQwOTA4NjgyNDUxNTFiYTQ1NTY0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Alright," she said, sitting up in the container. "I'll come with you."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkODNhZGYzNWFlYTQxMjFhMzUxNjdhMTBkMDhjN2Q5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"By Roog," Jabari said, tapping his thigh. "I can't believe that worked."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMDA3NGZjODJjMjQ1OGM4OTIxMjk1MTE2ZjkyY2Rk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"And just in time," Seydou turned from the console. "I managed to hack into the surveillance system. All of the cameras and recorders are down. Record deleted, too. Just need to hijack a Cargo Vessel then we'll be good to go."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YWM3YWVhMWNkZDQ3NTZiNzFiNzQ3NWY2YjU5ZjFj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Suddenly, an alarm went off, causing chaos. Workers scattered throughout the hub.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhN2I2OWRiZjY1MjQ4ZmVhYjUwOTJhNTQ4OGNlN2Vk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Chineke!" Seydou cursed. "We've got company!"</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZTVmMGM5MThjZDRhODlhYjI0MTU4MmZlMGVkZTA0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari turned and drew his Plasma Rifle, ready to fight.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOGZkOTRhMDA0MzRiZjliYmExNzk1ZDNjNjFlZDMx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Wilhelm here. I have visual of Radi-Mon movements in the Bishan Forest," Wilhelm said through Jabari's earpiece.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOWFjZGFmNTk1NDRmYzk5NTAyNGQ3ZjQxNDE0Yzg3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Celine here. I'm seeing the monsters. What's taking you two so long?" Celine's voice came through.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTUzNzBmOTQ5NTQzM2Q5YzhiM2Y0ZjQwMmExNWNj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"U6-M9 experienced a — slight malfunction, let's say," Seydou replied. "But Jabari took care of it with his super smooth talking skills, am I right?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNiODFlYTc3NzlkYzQ0YWViYmI1OTZlNmNjYjkzOTNj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Hurry up," Celine urged. "Seydou, do you have our Cargo Vessel?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NGQyOTdkYjcxOTRhZTQ4MDI0YTExMmIwOGE3ZjUx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"It'll take me a few minutes," Seydou said, returning to the terminal. "There's a ship in the next bay that looks to be in good condition. I'll hijack that one."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMWE4ZTNjOGEwMTQwNGJhYTc1MTYyMmNhNDhhMDAz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Get your Scarab, Jabari. It's in Cargo Hold 5." Celine ordered.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYTUwNTk1MDRiMDQ0Njc4YTkzNjVjMDRjY2U5NDM3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Stick with me," Jabari told Ume as she got out of the container. He looked around, trying to find the threat.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNDQzMWE5NGEwNjQ3ZGJiOWE5NGU2YjVmZTRlODAz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As they left the Cargo Hold, Ume tapped his back.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YmY1ZTRiNTY4OTRjMmU4NzRhOTNjMjY2NWJkMDll"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Do you have a gun I could use?" she asked, looking up at him. She was much shorter than Jabari.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MmQzNGE3MzJkNjRhN2Y4NzY0ZGJmZDExNjk1MmFk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You...want a gun?" Jabari was surprised.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZTcwMjUwZjU5ZjQwZjA4YTJmZWE5YTZhOGMyNjI4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"My programming tells me it'd be helpful to have a personal weapon in this situation," Ume explained, scratching her head. "That's what a gun is, right?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYWFlOTI0OTE0MDQ4N2FhYzhjZGNlODQxOWNlM2Jk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">After a moment, Jabari nodded and handed her his sidearm - a Plasma Handgun that matched his rifle in green and gold colors.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NzNmODNiNTYyMTQxZDRhNmRkMGYyMTcwYjJhNjA3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Thank you," Ume took the gun with a small smile.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYmY3ODNmZmVhZTQyZDJhZTFkMzZhMDFlOWY0ZDA0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A loud roar filled the air as Bone Fiends appeared, their skeletal forms moving toward them.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMjQwYjk3ZTRlZTQ3MDZhZTgxZDlmYjViNGMwMTQy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Contact!" Wilhelm shouted as he came out from behind some containers, his Plasma Carbine ready. Tall and muscular in his green Directorate uniform with gold trim, Wilhelm's platinum blonde hair and blue eyes stood out sharply.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZTgwYjQ0ZWY4YzRlOTc4NTRhNzA1ODU3MTg3Njcx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Helionite leak from Bay 3," Wilhelm called, looking at a wall display. "That's what drew them here. Bastards must've been nesting here and getting comfortable."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMTcyYjJhY2Y2MzRlZDA4MmI1Mjk1NDgxNGE0YjVi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Here they come!" Jabari aimed his rifle at the monsters. "For the Directorate!"</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOWY2MGI3ZGJjZDRkMDM4MDdmNjg1ZjNkMDRkMTk2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">He fired plasma bolts at the targets, with Wilhelm joining in. His Carbine fired green energy bolts with precision.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMjQyMmI2ZjNhMzRmZGE4MWQxY2VmYTMxYzRkMjA5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Ume held her handgun nervously, her hands shaking slightly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMDBlYzg2ODRkYjQzMWQ4NjVmMDJjYzkxYTFjYzQw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Steady, Ume," Jabari said. "Aim and breathe."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNjQ2MmMzN2Y0OTRlYjU4OWVmYjcyYTI2OGI5N2U2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">When Ume fired, her shots went wild, hitting walls and equipment instead of the monsters. The Bone Fiends screeched and moved closer.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMzlhMjI3YjhhYzRlYzJiNWNlZTRmYzkwMGUzNzlj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Controlled bursts," Wilhelm instructed calmly while taking down another creature. "Lieutenant, take the left flank! I'll handle the right."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5M2E5ODNhOWJiNjQzZWE5M2I3NGU2NTYwYzM0NzQ5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Understood!" Jabari stood firm. The Bone Fiends fell one by one.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0M2UyNThjODg0NTQ4YTVhNDkzNTUzNjM4ZDJmM2U2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Helionite's making them aggressive," Wilhelm said between shots. "We need to seal that leak or they'll keep coming."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YTA3ZmNjYTJlYzRlYTE4MTMxNWI4YzM2NDZiYTNh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari turned to see Ume firing with her eyes closed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZTVkNzBhMjFjNDRhZjU4ZTBkZDQ4ZDI2YzRlZTNl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Ume!" Jabari shouted. "Stop! Open your eyes!"</span></p>
<p class="cnNiY2UzZGZhNGU2YjQwMjFhMGY2MjU0ZmVjY2MzYjA4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She stopped firing and opened her eyes, looking confused at the gun in her hand.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNjFiYWMyYTE1NjQ2MmM4ODZjNDk3ZmM3YTk1ZWEz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari quickly moved to her, frustrated. "You cannot — you must not fire blindly, Ume! That could have killed us all!"</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNGE4NmM3MzE1YTRmZmNhMGIwZjE2YmNmOWZmOTE4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Ume tilted her head. "I know," she said quietly. "There is a... disconnect within me. A logical part of me knows I should aim and fire, but it feels so satisfying to ignore that. I can't explain it."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOTM4YWQ0N2Q2ODRjOThiYzA1MmQxMjkyYmU4MjI2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari sighed, unsure what to say.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MTA5ZDRhYWY3MDQzOTliZGIzMjUxYzBhYzQ5NWQ3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Look, you need to —" he started. "How do I say this? It's not — it's not that hard."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZTA2ODIzOWNmNDRkODFiNDlhYWI1NGU5NTBhMWRh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Easy now," Wilhelm approached, holding his carbine ready. "Jabari, check our six. I've got this."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNWY5ZDA1NDgyMjQzYTFiN2ZjNzFjMTgwZjg3M2E0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Wilhelm knelt before Ume, who held her gun loosely. "Being human isn't about being perfect," he said gently. "It's about feeling everything – even the parts that hurt."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMDc2ODM1NjUxMDQxZTRiYjdiZjgwYTVhNjJmOTI1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Suddenly, Ume started crying. "Being human," she sobbed, "is so painful. This freedom... It's so hard. I hate it!"</span></p>
<p class="cnM0Y2NlYWEwOThmNDQ4NGJiODcxZGE1Y2FkMTQyNjBh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari watched as Wilhelm put his hand on Ume's shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZmNlNWNiMjE3ZDRlOWI5ZjMwMzhkYjA2MWVmMzhl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The path of fear and struggle is well-trodden," Wilhelm said. "It leads to places of strength we never knew lay within us. Seen it countless times."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Y2U5ODEzOTVlZjQ3YTRhZjUzMzFkZTFjOTVhNTM4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"It doesn't make sense!" Ume continued crying.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOGQxYWNmY2MwZjRkZmU4ZDdjNmE5NWRiYjVhZjg3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"It's not supposed to," Wilhelm said, rubbing her shoulders. "That's what makes us human. Every challenge shapes the soul. And you, Ume, you have a soul. That's why you feel pain."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNDVkMDBhMTRiYTRkMzI4ZDEyYzUyOGE4NjVkOWM0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I have a soul?" she asked quietly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNzc4ZjMzMGFkZjQwYWVhMjQ5ZTE1YWMzNjBhZDU5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari watched, gaining new respect for Wilhelm.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNWRmMDgxZmNhZTQ1NjViYmFmNWFjMmQxOGYyMDYw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A terrible shriek interrupted them. Jabari turned with his rifle ready as a larger Bone Fiend burst through some containers, its claws leaving marks on the metal floor.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMWRmMmEwNDg3ODQwZThiZWJlZDNmZmMzNjY2Nzc0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Large Radi-Mon!" Ume cried. "Like the ones from old world movies—"</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMGY2YjEwN2U0MjQ1MDQ5ODdjZjY1MTQ1ZTNkZDdm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Focus!" Jabari ordered. He fired at the creature, but it absorbed the hits without falling.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZTY3Yzg1NGY0MjRmMWJhMmRjMzA5NmUzNGE3YTkx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"That's an Alpha. Usually mutated after feeding on enough Helionite," Wilhelm fired precise shots. "Target the joints! Ume, watch our pattern!"</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OTIxYTE2ZTljODRiOTliMDY4YmNiZjRiYWQ1YzMz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Ume steadied her hands and shot at the Alpha's feet, making it stumble. Jabari felt proud that she was trying.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzk0NGUxYWY1NTRmNmI5YTIzM2ZlYTZkZWNlOTNj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Hmm. Bay 3," Wilhelm said after killing the monster with a headshot. "I'm going there. 30 Atomic Dollars say I can't shut it down with the next 10 minutes."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NTk3YzdhOWVlZTQwZjNiMTczYmU2ODEzYjhjMTJh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari worried as Wilhelm prepared to leave.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2N2U0ODU5ZjkxMTRlMjA5NmQzMTZjZTQ4Mzg2NDQz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You sure, Wilhelm?" he asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZWMwYTQ3ODE2YjQwMzNhM2I3ZmFlYzQyNjhhNDE0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I've seen a few episodes like this before, Lieutenant." Wilhelm grinned before turning away. "Catch you in a minute or two."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzN2IwMzdjYWQ1ZDQwZjY5YmZiYTFhNzFmNjgxYzZh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">After Wilhelm left, Jabari and Ume looked at each other in silence.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMGU4YmQzODk3NjQ4YzM5MTUwZjAxY2I2MTc2Yjg4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Well," Jabari said, despite his uncertainty. "I'm not good with words. But when we return to the Directorate, I'll teach you. Walk you through – whatever you don't know. You can always come to me with questions. Anytime."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNjkxYjEwYmQ4NTQ5ZWQ5MDkzYTUzYTIyNTVjNzkz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Thank you," she said with a small smile as her tears stopped.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyODBmZGU3MzZiYjQ0YWU4ZjVhNDM4YWFlMDk0N2Zl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Before Ume could recover fully, they heard more Bone Fiends approaching.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTZiYWVkYmMxZTQ0ZmE5ZGMxYmJiZWZhNzdmOThh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Remember!" Jabari shouted, raising his rifle. "Every action must be purposeful!"</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YTdlMzg4ZjE4MDRiZTVhMmJiMjdkMGM4N2M5YzQ0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Four Bone Fiends charged toward them, jaws snapping and limbs moving rapidly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOGZkNDhhODBhNzQxOTk4MGMzM2E0MWQwMjdhNDM5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari fired precise shots, destroying one monster immediately. It exploded into fragments before dissolving into a green puddle.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNDIzYmVhM2Q4ZDQzNzVhNjc4MGE4M2MzNmFlYWI4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Ume steadied herself and raised her gun. "Purposeful," she said to herself. "Every action must be purposeful."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ODY4NmY3ODcwZTRmZTVhN2JhZDFjMGU1NGJmN2U5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Her first shot hit the second Bone Fiend directly in the head, killing it.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDQ5YzYyMzZlNjQ0ZWZiYWJlODU5ZjQwZTYwYmY0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"That's it! Keep it up!" Jabari encouraged her.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNDgwMGM0MjRmZTQ4MGViN2I5YjBjODk5ZThkYjg5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The third Bone Fiend jumped at them with its mouth open. Ume's heart raced as she fired several shots at its body. The creature staggered but kept coming.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOWM1NmRhZDRmMTQxMjNhOGQ1YjcxZmRlOGJiYWEw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari aimed at the wounded monster. Their combined fire destroyed it completely.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDc1ZjRiMmFjYzQ3OWRhMzcxMTcwZDVjYWI0OGJk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The last Bone Fiend tried to run away but got caught in some wires. It fell into a nearby machine with a crunch, disappearing completely.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YmI1YjdkNDUwOTQ2ZmI5ZGIxY2Y5YTgwYzVlMmE0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Right, umm…clear!" Jabari announced, lowering his weapon. He turned to Ume, who was staring at the remains.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MjJkYmRjYTJkNDRhZWM4NGVmZGE3NzM4YTM5YjAw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Hey. Are you hurt?" he asked with concern.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZGRlYjliYmIwZjQ5MjJiMmJjYWRkYWY3NGVjZmJi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Ume shook her head. "No, I... I am fine, Jabari," she said, though her lips were still trembling.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NTVmOTU3N2RlYjRkZjY5MjlmOTYyMjc1MmUzMzY5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Okay. Good." Jabari nodded, looking at the remains of the monsters. "When I first studied at the Reserve Officer School, seeing blood and gore used to scare me too. So I understand if you feel weird about it."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NTc1NDY3MzkxMDQ4YzJhZjU3NDUyZmZkNWRhYTNm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"They were whole creatures. And now...they're just green goo," Ume said matter-of-factly, looking up at Jabari. "Green goo."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOGExNGNiZjAwMTQxMzA5ZjQ0NWMyMjVhZjFlZjdm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Oh, that." He smiled proudly. "Yes, that's normal. The plasma bolts fired by my people's weapons have that effect sometimes. It happens when you land a critical hit or something."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMmI0NmM3NmNjMzQxZTFhYzA2Mjc5ZjQyMjRlOTVi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Green goo!" Ume suddenly laughed, all her sadness gone. "It's so fun!"</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMmZmODZkMDRmNzQ5MTRiODlhZGU0ODljOTY2ZGEw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Well, I mean," Jabari laughed with her. "Our Directorate weapons really pack a punch."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MTRjYTczZWM0NjQ2MjlhODdmMmEyMDk3MTZiMTk4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"It would seem so," Ume nodded shyly, calming down.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYjYxMjllMzIxMzQwYzFhMDc1ZmVkZWE4YWEwZjAw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I've got to power up my Scarab," he said, getting serious again. "Can you hold this position?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NGNlMmI0ZTE3ZjRlOGE5MGIxYmQ0N2E5MjA4N2M1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Her eyes now showed determination as she gripped her gun tighter. "Yes."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZWVhZjI3NGVjNDQ2NDZhYmQ0YWQxMDYwYWJkOTA0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Good. I'll be back soon," Jabari nodded before turning and walking away, his boots echoing on the metal floor.</span></p>
