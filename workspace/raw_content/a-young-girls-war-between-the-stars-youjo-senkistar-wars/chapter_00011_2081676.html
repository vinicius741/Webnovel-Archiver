<p class="cnMyODk3NTA1N2JlYTRjMzNiYzI2NGVjZDIyM2QxMmFh" style="margin-bottom: 0">Looking at master Dooku holding his newborn daughter for what may be the last time, I kept silent as he and Augwynne shared a quiet moment. The man was calm on the surface, but every now and then, I felt his emotions flare up revealing the storm he was keeping tightly in check. Just from the little bits I saw, he was a mess of pride, joy, sorrow, anger, longing, and more—felt in brief flashes so intense I’d had to wall myself off completely and <em>still</em><span style="font-style: normal"> felt the occasional outburst slam against my mental walls.</span></p>

<p class="cnNlNTZiZjRlMjRlMjQ1ZmI5ZTgxYTNkY2EzOTQxZDQ3" style="margin-bottom: 0">There was nothing more to say on the matter, really. He had made up his mind to adhere to the Jedi code, regardless of the fact that this was perhaps the moment when he regretted it most. Nothing I said would change his mind—at least, not today.</p>

That a man couldn’t </span><span style="font-style: normal">have a</span><span style="font-style: normal"> </span><span style="font-style: normal">family in the true sense because </span><em>connections lead to fear, fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering</em><span style="font-style: normal"> as master Yoda so eloquently put it in one of his many lectures to the younglings.</span><span style="font-style: normal"> Ironically, that missed the fact that connections with other people made us stronger by giving us a network of people we could call on when we needed aid—that we could draw strength, skill, ideas, and other resources from. You should do everything you could to make and encourage connections </span><span style="font-style: normal">with others and earn their loyalty.</span><span style="font-style: normal"> </span><em>Even I knew that!</em><span style="font-style: normal"> </span></p>

<p class="cnMwOTljZjM5YzFlNzQ5ZjRhMTljNjgwZmQ1Y2QyYjQw" style="margin-bottom: 0">It was a problem for later. For now, I had more pressing concerns. Namely, research on Serenno. I needed data and I had hit a roadblock on my searching. The map data I found was all horribly out of date and something told me that was intentional. I was going to be doing some legwork tracking down whatever I could once we got back to Coruscant. If we were going to be engaging in a ground war, <em>information was key</em><span style="font-style: normal">. I wouldn’t go in blind if I had a say in it. I wanted to know the layout of every potential combat zone well in advance, and then I’d update that information once we got there—but the less I had to update, the better.</span></p>

<p class="cnMxZGNlZjdmMzM2ZDQ0ZDA4NjY3ZmFjZTljM2E4NGQ3" style="margin-bottom: 0">I also needed to dedicate some time in the archives to studying these ‘Mandalorians.’ Their customs, history, what to expect. I didn’t want to embarrass myself or masters Dooku and Dyas when we got there—or worse, commit some avoidable faux pas, offend someone, and destroy our chances of recruiting their aid before we ever got a foot in the door. The Japanese salaryman in me wouldn’t stand for the shame of being the reason we were unable to recruit allies to our cause, because I didn’t take the time to learn that you were supposed to bow <em>exactly forty-five degrees</em><span style="font-style: normal"> to be polite and anything more was an insult, while anything less was considered not showing proper respect.</span></p>

It must have slipped my mind, what with everything going on with Serenno. And speaking of, I believe it’s time we depart. Are you ready?”</p>

We passed the trip back to the ship in silence—unbothered even by the native wildlife. When we reached the ship, I stowed my gear and made my way up to the cockpit. Master Dooku had already taken his seat and gestured at the controls.</p>

<p class="cnM1ZDVlYmE5MmIyNjQ4MTViYTJmNDg3ZDJmZDJlMjI2" style="margin-bottom: 0">Master Dooku hummed, considering for a moment. “There are free traders, outside of the Trade Federation.

<p class="cnNhM2I1NTQ0NmM5ZTQwN2Y4NzNiZWI2ZTFhZGM4ZjZj" style="margin-bottom: 0">“You suspect they’re involved?” I asked, and he nodded once.</p>

<p class="cnM0ZTNjYTEwOGZmZDQ1YTg5NjBiYWY0NDg1M2ZkMjZj" style="margin-bottom: 0">“The possibility is there. And if they aren’t, it’s still better that we don’t draw their attention and let them know we’re aware of their plans.”</p>

<p class="cnMwZDM4Mjg5ZDUzNzQ2MTFhYWVhYzYwOTU3NDliZDhi" style="margin-bottom: 0">That made sense. There didn’t even need to be a traitor among the Jedi for the information to get out. Poor IT security or simply overhearing someone say the wrong thing at the wrong time could account for it. With that in mind, I made a mental note to be extra mindful of my surroundings when I went out to work on this project once we got back. <em>Perhaps I should request some backup?

Nothing I would trust my life with. I was still studying, learning, and developing my skills. There was also a list of equipment I’d need to buy once I got back. There was only so much I could do with my tablet and by repurposing some extra wires and parts from the ship, after all.</p>

Considering my next stop, I decided on getting new robes first and began heading that direction. “Everything I was able to dig up while on Dathomir was outdated by ten years and I didn’t have a good enough connection to dig further. We need to check the archives and the records to see if we have any more up to date maps or if someone was out that way recently, and if so if they have maps. If we don’t have anything within the last year, we’ll need to seek outside sources. Master Dooku gave me a list of contacts to run down. He also said I probably shouldn’t go alone if we need to speak with them in person, so I would appreciate your company, if you’re willing?”</p>

It was recent enough to serve as something we could work with and there were other sources of data I could find and use along with what we now had to update it. If I had to, I’d dig into property records, tax records, building permits, and the like as that stuff was all backed up offsite from most planets right here on Coruscant as an extra-planetary off-site backup. I </span><em>highly doubted</em><span style="font-style: normal"> any slicer who had messed with the most recent map data would have been so thorough as to also delete all of that. It’d take time, but I could work with a five year window.

These complexes were essentially huge server farms, storing and backing up all of the data that flowed through Coruscant. </span><span style="font-style: normal">The way I understood the planetary network structure after my research on the subject, it went like this:</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ODE4YTI0Y2NjMDQwOWY4OGIzZmIxNTI0N2JlMDZh" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMzYTFjZDJiNTAxNjQ1NDNiYjA4ODg4ODQwNzY4MDEx" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal">Data came into the network of satellites around Coruscant and was beamed down to various receivers on the planet. It was then sent off to the primary data transfer network which handled all of the storage and access requests coming in from across the galaxy and the primary backup network where it would go into Read Only mode and never be </span><em>overwritten</em><span style="font-style: normal">, only incrementally updated with each update logged. From there, i</span><span style="font-style: normal">t could be accessed from any hub within each network, which handled all of the load balancing to minimize lag on requests.</span></p>

<p class="cnMyN2Y5YTc2ODYwZTQ1NzhiOTE2ODI5MGZmNDcyYzIx" style="margin-bottom: 0">At my suggestion, we skipped the active network altogether, since it was compromised—there was no point in wasting time trying to sort out why that was right now, when a report sent in would do, after we got what we wanted. Instead, we went after the backup network, where the data <em>didn’t get deleted—</em><span style="font-style: normal">or at least, it shouldn’t be. Which was why we were at the </span><em>tertiary</em><span style="font-style: normal"> hub instead of the primary or secondary, just in case someone had gotten clever and organized a convenient server room fire to physically destroy the storage media.</span></p>

<p class="cnM2OTc0MjFjYmMyMzRkMDlhYThlN2IyNGQ5NmFmOGQ5" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">Obi smiled and leaned against the desk. “We’d like to see about accessing some data. You see, we’ve found what we think is an error with something on the main network and we’d like to see the backup data from the last few months to confirm. The data is critical to an ongoing operation, you see?”</p>

<p class="cnNiZmU1OTYzZDUwYjRlYmJhMGU1YjM0NjdlNjgzOWM5" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Uh, this one,” he brought up the camera feed, showing a human-looking man, though when he turned towards the cameras we could make out bony ridges around his eyes and forehead, and a wider nose. “Imzig guy.

<p class="cnM1YWE4MmI5ZGJiOTQ1NjNiNzBjZDU1NzlmNjdiYzUx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM5OWEwOWQzNjk4MTQ5OTA4ODY3NjI5YmNlNGJiNzli" style="margin-bottom: 0">Obi hopped over and joined me in looking at the monitor as the man worked. “Did you call and confirm he was supposed to be here?” she asked, and the guard rolled his eyes.</p>

<p class="cnM0ZDFiN2EyNzFhNzQzMzBhMDUxMGRhOWQ1ZjM4NmM5" style="margin-bottom: 0">There was a flash from the screen and the man turned and began to run for the door, leaving behind a smoking piece of equipment. I could hear the grinding of my own teeth and Obi turned a smile on the guard. “I’m not sure, but is it standard practice to shoot the computer with a blaster when it stops working?”</p>
<p class="cnNhNmY0NGMzODU0NTQ4YTI5ZDkyMmFhMzRlZjM5Mjgw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNmNGY4YjgxNWJkNjQ4ODM4MzIzZDAwNGZjNDViNzVi" style="margin-bottom: 0">“…Pretty sure it’s not,” he muttered, standing and pulling the blaster pistol from his belt. “He’s gotta come back this way to get out.”</p>

<p class="cnMwYzI1ZmU5NTk1NDQ3ZDc5M2EzZWE5MmYzMmYzMDNk" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Good. Put that away and take cover.

<p class="cnMwMWJhOGU1N2UzMzRiOWJiODQ1ZTNhY2ZlY2QyMWM1" style="margin-bottom: 0">A few moments later, the elevator opened and the man came dashing out, only to slide to a stop as Obi stepped out, the familiar <em>snap-hiss</em><span style="font-style: normal"> and buzz of the blue blade springing to life very much like this universe’s equivalent to the sound of a shotgun being racked for the effect it produced. I used the distraction to step out silently behind him, my own saber ready but not on. Obi smiled as she took up a battle stance. “Surrender peacefully and come with us.”</span></p>

I watched in what felt like slow motion as he raised it to his head, radiating terror. My lightsaber snapped to life and he flinched, squeezing the trigger and sending a shot into the roof as he spun to look behind him—too late as the white-silver blade swung through the air and caught the blaster, destroying it and the hand holding it.</p>
