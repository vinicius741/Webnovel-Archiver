<p align="left" class="cnNhMDM2MGEyNDYxMzQxYWVhMDJjMGQ1MTliMzVjOGJl">The vampire charged forward with her Karlack in hand. <em>Not only will I prove to you that I can fight without getting hurt, I’ll also do it with my offhand.</em></p>
<p align="left" class="cnM5OTZmNWFiNWJjMDQ5NjBiNWRhMTc5NzE4MDUwMGM0"><em> </em>Karlack didn’t answer Emma’s challenge, yet it didn’t stop Emma. Rather than use her sword, she used her left hand. She recalled the sensations when she first conjured up magic. At that time, she’d hardly had any magic power, yet it was night time. Now, even during the day, she felt her reserves had become more plentiful.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMzNjU4YzM5MzJlOTRhN2U5MTkwZDc0ZTZmNjgyNjU0">“Even this measly amount should be enough.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMwMGQ1MGZmZTNhNDQ3MWRhMTNkZWQyMjdmZGVmZDBk">She ducked under the swing of a club. The gnoll braced itself and prepared to block the sword. This proved to be a fatal mistake. Emma used the opening so slam her palm against the monster’s chest. She channeled her familiar ice magic the moment she felt the impact.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNiMzk3MjAxODgxYTRlZTFiY2NhNmVjYzQyM2RhNDhh">A large spear of ice pierced through the beast’s heart, killing it instantly. A roar of agitation came from behind her, and another club was swung down at her head.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM5ZGU0MTlhZmFjYjRkZDViYTEyYmRiNDA2YmM4NTQ3">The vampire channeled her frozen mana across her entire body, becoming a floating cold mist. The monster’s swing went right through her body, and it’s momentum continued as it stumbled.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMwZDQwZTZhYmNjZjRmODRiMzY3ZWVjNDIzNjYxY2Zk">Emma appeared behind the gnoll and conjured an ice ninja star. She threw it as hard as she could at the back of the creature’s head, and the sharp shard pierced its skull, continuing on through the gnoll’s face. Blood rained down like a fountain, and the frozen star continue into the sky until it slowly melted.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM1ZGFkZjRjMmFhMzRjZTY4YmM1MGFmZmVkYWY0YWEz">Two more gnolls charged in tandem this time, attempting to overwhelm her. They both swung their clubs towards the vampire’s head.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM0ZDJlZjJmODIwMzRkMGY4YmIxOGNhNWUxNDc0OGMz"><em>It seems like these beasts aren’t very smart, are they? </em></p>
<p align="left" class="cnM1ZTU2YjE2OGZiNzQ5ODRhODQxMTQ5YzkyZjE5NTJm">All she had to do was slide beneath their clubs, and the gnoll’s weapons slammed against each other. Vibrations shook their arms, and Emma was quick to free one of them of his limb.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM5ZWJlNDA1MWI5YzQ1YzBhZTZkMTRjN2M1YWNkNjAw">The vampire’s arm shot up towards the monster’s arm pit, and she channeled magic, forming her arm into a frozen scythe. More blood sprayed into the air as the arm fell to the ground.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM1NjIyZDQ1Yjc1YzRlZmU5NmMxY2UxZjgzOWNlYzI3">Emma watched the monster howl in pain and fury. It swung its only remaining arm towards her head. The vampire couldn’t manage to regain balance with her other arm, so she was forced to use Karlack. She met the punch of the monster with a swing of her bratty sword.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM1MWM1MTc2ZDYxYjQ4Yjk4ODA5NDU1MDdlMWMyZDk3">The sword sliced cleanly through the beast’s wrist, severing its hand completely and spraying blood onto Emma’s face.</p><span class="cmM0MjY0YzA3MDM4OTRmNmE5ODhjNGNiZmYwZmQzM2Y3"><br/>Did you know this text is from a different site?

<p align="left" class="cnNlZTgyMDU0YjE2NjRkNTNiNThmM2M1MWMwOWEyMDJj">Emma licked her teeth, taking in some of the gnoll’s blood, and using it to replenish some of her lost magic power. The vampire channeled magic into her sword arm and swung in a wide arc.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNlYmI4NDkxNWRkNTQ0YmE4MDY4MDE0NTY3Zjg4ZjYz">Karlack cut through both of the gnolls in one clean swing, and both of them were set free from their lower bodies. Their halves fell to the ground with a loud thud.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMxMDRiYjIzZWZkMDQ3NDg5NTI2Y2IwODE2MGZmZTVh">Emma turned to the last gnolls with a grin on her face. <em>It looks like I’m going to win this bout, Karlack. </em></p>
<p align="left" class="cnM2NmI4OTNiMzI3ODRjZDM5NmIyOTc2YWEwYTE1Y2Iz"><em> </em>The sword didn’t answer, and Emma froze in her tracks.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMyZGE0NDMzOWEzZTQ0YzY5ODk3ZjUzNWVmYWI5NWRl">Up above, the whole sky was blotted out. A dark figure hovered in the air and covered up the sun’s harmful rays.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNkZmUzMzkyOTJiZTQwMmJhMTgzODUxZjRhMzQyN2Uw">Emma heard the beating of wings and looked up. Her mouth hung open in disbelief. She wasn’t sure if she should curse her luck or marvel at the sight.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM2MDMxMzU1Nzg0NDQ5YTc5ZjA4NmFhY2FjNTRjYmFk">The dragon beat its wings and hovered above the chaos. The gnolls and the vampire could only stand still in shock, waiting to see what the creature of legends would do.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNhZGVhMDE3NWFmYjQ5NWRiNDI1MmNhM2FlMjFjMTQ0">Emma watched it willingly plummet to the ground. The dragon’s large front legs landed directly onto the gnolls, killing them in an instant. The vampire felt the ground beneath her shake, and the trees behind the large behemoth shook. It was as if nature bowed down to the being.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM5OWM0YThiZDljZjQzOGVhYzMzYjM4OTYzNmI1OGI4">The vampire loosened her grip on her sword. She nearly dropped Karlack to the ground in her astonishment.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNlNzA4OTYwY2NiYzQ5MGFiNmY4MDE4M2JlMGQ4YjAw">Emma never thought she’d ever feel this kind of fear ever again. Even when faced with death, there was little fear in her heart, but under the piercing eyes of the dragon the vampire’s arms grew shaky. Yet she remembered the little girl riding the horse.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNjYjg1NTc4ODQ4NjRmOWM4MTNiZWMxZmYwOGMwMjdj">The thought of protecting that girl brought a certain serenity to her mind. The cloud of fear was vanquished, and she gripped Karlack tighter in her hands. Emma readied the sword and pointed it at the dragon, preparing herself for a fight to the death.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM4NjVkNjJkNzUzOTRhZDI4Mzc5MjY0ODkyNWMyNWY5">However, all of that worrying and fearing was for nothing. The next second, the dragon vanished in a huge puff of black smoke. A giant cloud settled on the clearing as if someone set off a smoke grenade, yet it didn’t take long for the fog to clear.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMwM2I2ZmU3MzU0YjRiNjM5YzRlYjdiODEwMTk2Mjdm">When it did, the dragon was completely replaced by a gorgeous woman. She stood there with long black hair and beautiful robes to match it. Horns curled behind her head, giving the woman a certain graceful look. She had a unique beauty that was only accentuated by black scales running down the sides of her neck. Even the corner of her brows seemed to contain some remnants of her draconic form.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNlOGU1NDg1OTlhYTQwYjVhNGNiYWVlNTBkZTc4ZTQw">The elegant woman coughed into her hand. “Forgive me, I did not mean to frighten you. I forgot that my natural form can have that effect on people.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNiOWRiOWJmOTExZjQwOTc5ZTE3NTNlOTQ4MmMzNjg2">Emma’s mouth refused to form words. Instead, it could only hang open stupidly. She didn’t know what to be more surprised by. The fact that a dragon turned into a girl or the fact that the dragon was talking to her for some reason.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNjNWQ5MTBmN2VlZjQzYzE5NTNhMTU5ODMwZGYwMzA0">The dragon in question approached the stunned vampire. The elegant woman waved her hand in front of Emma’s face. “Are you okay? You look pale…”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM1YjBlMjc2ODQ1MzQ4OWNiZWNiZWJhNWEyZGQ4ZTFj">Emma finally snapped back to reality, somehow finding words. “That’s my natural state...Um...Who...What are you?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM1MjE2NGVkZDk3NTRiNDc4ZGMyNDgwNTQ1NzUwZGRi">The dragon girl chuckled and extended her hand. “You can call me Lunaria. And you are?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM0MzhlNjdhYjVhMDQ0ZGI4YmZhYTJlMGQ3Yzc4ZGU2">“I’m vampire...And I’m an Emma.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMxYTc0ZGNkY2FjZjQ2YmQ4NGJiM2YwYzYxMzE1NWFi">The Emma felt herself cringing on the inside. <em>Nailed it. </em></p>
