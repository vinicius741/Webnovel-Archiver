<p class="cnMwYmE2NTE5NDMyZjQyOGI5ZWUzMzQzZjYxODlmN2Yw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">I need to be honest with you all. Over the past week, Nucleus has been hit with multiple low ratings (four 0.5-stars and a 1-star) across different chapters. These ratings target as early as the story’s Prologue, implying the rater didn't even read before rating it.</span></p>

<p class="cnNhMDdjY2QyNWQ3NDRlNDJhNjJiNmVlNjY0OGQ5MWU0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Royal Road's moderation team has been helpful and removed some of these ratings after investigation, but the others remain. The timing and pattern of these ratings – targeting chapters that have been up for over 40 days without issue – feels deliberate rather than coincidental.</span></p><span class="cjFjOWM1MjhlMDJjYTQxYmNiZDA3ZWRkZDQyZTIxZmM0"><br/>Unauthorized reproduction: this story has been taken without approval.

After 10-hour shifts at my increasingly demanding day job, I come home and instead of unwinding, I'm worldbuilding, plotting, and typing until my fingers ache. I do this because I love creating this universe and sharing it with you all. But this wave of unexplained negative ratings has me questioning if I can sustain this emotionally.</span></p>

If Nucleus has brought you any enjoyment, escape, or made you curious about what happens next, <strong>could you PLEASE consider leaving a rating or review?</strong></span></p>

Just your genuine thoughts on the story, whatever they might be. Even a brief comment about what's working for you would mean a lot.</span></p>

They've brightened difficult days, helped me refine the story, and kept me motivated when my energy wanes. Your engagement means everything – not just for visibility on the platform, but for my resilience as a creator.</span></p>
