<p class="cnNkZjE3YzM5MzgwMTQxNWJiNWQ3MWRiMGQ4OTNkM2Nj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Did the fate of an entire group of fantastical people—heck, of the entire world, even—rest upon my shoulders?</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYzlkOTlhNzBhNTRhMjk5NTczMWJiZjRiNzYyOGY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">One could easily argue it did. But the moment I found myself inside the sacred shrine, that thought didn’t cross my mind. As if I were the star of some cheap, B-grade movie, the doors closed behind me on their own.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMTVkMjc1MTYzOTQxNTFhMTg2ODQ2ZjdhMTE3ZjVi"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">That was rather ominous. Hopefully not a sign of things to come.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNkOGI2YjUyMDNjNDQ2NDhiYTM1Y2RjM2FjYTgyN2Ix"><span style="font-weight: 400">First, I had to get my bearings in this place. Thanks to the small orb of light Hikari had conjured, the small room was brightly illuminated.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDgzYzZlZTExOTQ3ZmRhYTI1NzU1ODEzODkxNDVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Considering the importance of the place, the Shrine was a simple room—frankly a bit deflating. The centerpiece was an altar with the floor raised in front of it. The indentations on the raised step seemed as though they were made for angels to kneel on to deliver their prayers. The remaining space on the circular wall was adorned with intricate patterns and abstract decorations. Frosted glass windows were high up near the ceiling, but no light shone through them because of the darkness outside.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1N2MwOWJlNDE2NDQyNTc4ZmI5YjVjNjFmMGU3NWNk"><span style="font-weight: 400">In summary, there was nothing obvious here that could be that famous Controller.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1N2RhMTVmZTU0NzQwNjdhZWExZWNlYTA2MGUwODYx"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">There must be a secret room, most likely under the floor.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNiNTM0YjQzMTU3ZDQ5ZTdiMTc3Y2E3NzZlZGUyYThl"><span style="font-weight: 400">With no clues to go on, I began investigating the most suspicious item in the room—the altar at its center. However, a quick glance at it yielded nothing of interest; it was literally just an altar, and its function was obvious.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTMzNGFkNmNkMDQ2YmQ4NjkxNWM4ZTMyNjEwYzIw"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess the only way out of this is to pray at the altar.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnM0MDQ2OTM2OTQ2MzRmMzNiMGRjMmI5YTEzYTQyMWM4"><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt a bit awkward about praying to a god I knew did not in fact exist, but there wasn’t enough time to diddle-daddle about it. I knelt down in front of the altar, copied the same praying gesture Shiina had made back on Earth, and closed my eyes.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZjk2YjMzZjI2ZTRjMDk5NWZjNDg0Njg0MDQ1MTdl"><span style="font-weight: 400">I let my mind wander for a bit, thinking that I </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">actually</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> had to pray, but fortunately, that wasn’t necessary. Out of nowhere, I heard a female voice in my mind.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNmU3ZWU5MmM1YTRhMmE5ZDg1NmY4ZjU4NmQzMTEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">«You, who wishes to see our most sacred treasure, answer this question from the bottom of your heart. What is the most important thing in the world?»</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YTM1NjBkYjJhZTRjNWJiYzg3OGQxY2VmNDE2MWMx"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, that one’s easy.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnMxOTJlZTc3N2NmODQ1MTZiZmJiNjIzZTI3MzM0MzJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">The answer was obvious. And so I responded aloud.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZmQ0MDZhNmY1MjRhOTViZGZhOTk5NGNjOTA3YmIy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“God.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MDAyMzc1NWVhMTQ1MzZiYWQzYjk4MjNhMGNhYmQw"><span style="font-weight: 400">I was so confident in my answer that it took me a while to realize nothing had happened.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMjYzZmY1ZTY1ZDRiY2Q5NDZjNTRhYzkxNmEwZDY3"><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried again a few times, but it wasn’t working. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZjA5YzFmMDBhNTQ5ZDliNDczNDU0MzcyM2NlNGFj"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Wait, what’s going on here?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnM2NmRlMzQyMmZmOTQzMDViY2Q3MDU3ZDYwYzU4MmI3"><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, to an angel, the most important thing in the whole world was indeed God. Shiina talked about God just like any religious fanatic would, and their whole society was built around their existence.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YzVmY2M1OTE1MjQyMDM5Njc1YmVjOTc5NWExMzNk"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe only an angel or even an archangel can answer? No, that doesn’t make sense. Otherwise, the archangels wouldn’t have been so worried about us getting inside. And plus, the voice still talked to </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">me</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400"> and I’m just a human.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNlYmZlZWY3NmE0NTRiMTdhMGQ2NmY0MWU3NjljOWIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">So what was the answer?</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MzE0YjU1YmYzYzRlMWY4NDlkMGI4YTVkOTIyNjM2"><span style="font-weight: 400">I racked my brain, trying to figure out what it could be. And then I realized something.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzNlYmE3MWIxMjQ3ZTliMTcxMTkwYjgzNTI5M2Zi"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Wait. This answer supposedly gives access to the Controller, something normal angels shouldn’t even know exists. So whatever the answer is, it must be something they wouldn’t figure out if they ever came across this place.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNiMjBkMjJiMzVmYTRhNGVhNmI2NWNiODQ1MmRhODFl"><span style="font-weight: 400">That train of thought was, however, quite dangerous. After all, the answer could literally just be a random codeword, or not even a word at all.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYTM0MjdlYzNjZTRlNWNhOTlkODYzYzNjNTk3ODIz"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">But the voice spoke to </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">me</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">. It said “answer this question from the bottom of </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">your</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400"> heart.” So maybe the answer truly is </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">my own unique answer.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NGIzMDRlNmI1MjRlNTRhNmI5ZjIyZjY5YzZjMzEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">So I thought about it, long and hard. What was the most important thing in the world to me? I thought about my friends. I thought about my family, my mom, my dad, my sister, my grandparents, and everyone else. I thought about my favorite games, novels, manga, and movies. I thought about everything I could.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYWFkYmFkNWYwZjRlMDVhODdhNTAzNTY3ZGEzNzJj"><span style="font-weight: 400">But no matter how much I thought, there really was only one possible answer.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MTAyNzZlZjg0ODQ1OThiODBlYzljYTYyMGI2YWMy"><span style="font-weight: 400">So I smiled.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxODI4YTg1NTE1MjQxYzU4YWE1NGI1NzlkZDkwZmMy"><span style="font-weight: 400">What was the most important thing in the world to me?</span></p><span class="cjk1OTFjMTg0MzExMjRjYTJhZDBkMzFlMTA4ZWE1MzZj"><br/>Unauthorized duplication: this narrative has been taken without consent. Report sightings.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNmZTdmOTdhMzBjNTRjYmY4NWQxOTkzMDA3NDA0NGEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Obviously, that was the person who had saved me eight years prior.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwN2RiM2JkZTZjMzRmZDNhNzAxZTdiMjEzM2IzYTcz"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">And who is still saving me right now. The person I want to reach so badly I literally came to another world to bring her back.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNjMjNhM2RhYTYwMjQzYjU5YzEyNTk5NWNkMjcwNGMy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ayumi.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNThmMjVkNjRjNDQ4ODI5MWE1MDZjODUzMDdjM2M4"><span style="font-weight: 400">I wasn’t surprised when the ground rumbled in front of me. I opened my eyes and got up. Where there was once just a marble floor was now a spiral staircase, leading to depths unknown.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OTU0YjRlMGYzNTRjN2M5YTAzY2U0MjEwOTg3ZWY2"> </p>
<p class="cnNiM2VmMDZkMjI1YjRjNTZiNWZiYzZmMGNkYzllMWRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">* * *</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MWMxMjZlNTkwNTRhMTQ5Mjk1OTA4ZDMxYWY5MzUx"> </p>
<p class="cnM3NTVkZmY3N2YzYzQxZmVhNzdhZGJmMzMzNmNiZmU0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Without missing a beat, I immediately made my way down the staircase. Unfortunately, Hikari’s light wasn’t smart enough to follow me; the more I climbed down, the darker it got. The light bouncing from the reflective walls got dimmer as I descended. Darkness consumed me from all sides. With no source of light from above, I became aware of a dim, mechanical-blue ambiance creeping from below. As the light became stronger, I could feel my heart rate spike.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMWRlNjM5MGJjYzRlZGY4Mjk2MjVjOWQyZjc3OGNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">What lay beneath the Shrine, the most sacred place for angels?</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNjRiZDNiMTE1MjQyZjRhODkwNjAzOTQ0MjI2OWI5"><span style="font-weight: 400">What was the shape of this Controller the archangel mentioned?</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNGZiYzJjNTU5YzQxYzRhM2I0OTljZTIwM2VhOTFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">And, more importantly, could I even do anything with it? Could I figure out a way to bring Ayumi back?</span></p>
<p class="cnM5M2JkN2QxYzk5NjQ1YmNiM2ViNjcwYjVlM2Q4NDY3"><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, at the beginning of this saga, I didn’t care about angels. When my memories were returned, Ayumi’s passion didn’t move me. My only objective was to bring her back to normal. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjN2Y1MTdmMWRkYjRiMzZiYjg2MTk4ZTc3NGI2MzIy"><span style="font-weight: 400">That goal just so happened to line up with her goal of saving the angels. And that also lined up with Hikari’s new goal of seeing what was beyond the lies of her society.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZmZlOTYxNGZkNzQzNDM5MThmMzkzYWEzMGUyMzRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, after learning of the disregard the archangels had for the life of their subjects, I had finally understood Ayumi’s wrath.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YjExY2RkODg2MzRmYmI5YzVjYWIyM2YwM2Y0Njgz"><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, what was so different between angels and humans in this virtual world?</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Mjg0NThiMzVkNTQ2YWI5MDZmYTQ2ZTE3MTNiMGVk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Weren’t we also being lied to? Weren’t we also subject to the same danger of being deleted on a whim? Of a rogue individual unplugging us out of existence?</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZTVkODQ3Y2ZhMTRhY2NhOTMyODE2NDg2YWU2NGJk"><span style="font-weight: 400">At some point, I had come to care about them. Even if our paths would have never crossed if not for this crisis, now that they were intertwined, I couldn’t abandon them and return to my quiet life.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjODVjMmU4ZjRkYTRmNjFiNWQ0MjU0MDg5N2NhZjMz"><span style="font-weight: 400">During my musings, the room below the Shrine had come into view. And right in the center of it, the only possible object that could have been here had indeed been here all along.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlY2RkYTI1YmZjMDRiZjhiOTkyNzgwMzhjNjA1YWNk"><span style="font-weight: 400">A computer.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYmU0YjA2OTEwMTQ2YmZhMzU1NTNiMTIzNGU1NmQw"><span style="font-weight: 400">A large, curved monitor, almost completing half a circle. A table made from an unidentifiable material. A single keyboard and mouse. A chair in front of the table, also made from an unknown material.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTQ5ZmRiZmUyNTQ4NjNhODhhYzBkOTAyYTczMzI0"><span style="font-weight: 400">There were no visible cables. The monitor was an ethereal object, not connected to the world. In a peculiar way, it made sense that this was the object controlling the world.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMzQxZDZjZTcwMjQzYWRhMDZiZDkyZjlkN2RjYzA4"><span style="font-weight: 400">The aptly named Controller.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDFlMjY4NGYzODQ2YzFiOWI4NDRjNGYwMmE4MGEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">The ambient blue light came from stripes on the walls. As soon as I took a step inside the room, they transmuted into strong cream-colored lights.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMzdhOTJkMzQzZDRiNTRiY2Y1OTYyOTU1ZjMwYTJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">With no hesitation, I sat on the chair, which lit up the computer monitor. On the right side, there were a myriad of graphs. They reminded me of real-time performance graphs on debug menus of games. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzMzZkNjBiZWYyMTRlNjJhYTJlMTE3ZmExMzYwNTA4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Judging by the sheer amount of red, warning-like message boxes, I could tell the situation wasn’t good. On the opposite side was a big progress bar, and it was about three-fourths completed. There was a digital clock below it, which I assumed was the time remaining; it currently sat at twenty-seven minutes. The center was a sterile desktop space with an equally sterile gray wallpaper with several icons arranged near the top.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZWY0NDhmYTE3MzQ0ZTA5OGE4OWJhMzJiN2YxNDRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">I scoured through the various graphs on the right, the progress bar on the left, and the various menu options in the center, but I was faced with a major hurdle—the entire UI was written in English. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3MjIyMmEwYTNjODQ0MDQ5OGU4MWQxMDE4MDEwYzNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew the basics of the language, but after messing with it for a while, I decided that the options seemed way too important. I couldn’t just go pressing buttons at random.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhODM4YmQ3NGI3MzQxYzVhMzllOTI2YzQ2YzRlMzgx"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was, however, a very familiar icon on the top row of the screen: the help button. I clicked on it in what seemed like a last-ditch attempt to save the situation. Much to my surprise, a cutesy, humanoid figure materialized on the bottom corner of the screen.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZGM4NTVjNTFmZDQ2NmZiOGE2YjAzOGJkYzdlYzFj"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">What’s this, a mascot character?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNlOTIzOTczZmNjNTRmNDk5YTdlZTU5MGYwYjhlZWM4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you need my assistance?” It was the same immaterial female voice from before.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYjNhNDM0Nzg5MjQwMmVhOTAzMzExZjRhZWVmYjhh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehhh… I can’t understand anything on this computer. Can you… help me somehow?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNzFlOGJjZjBlMzQ2OGVhN2E5MmQ4OGYyMjFkNjI5"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Why am I speaking so formally? This is probably a dumb AI or something along those lines. It’s not like it can understand me.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnMwYTRhNGM3ZjRlYTQ4NWFiODQyMmY5NmExMjE3NGMy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Certainly. Changing the display language to Japanese.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYjhlZGQwOGU4ZTQyZWM4M2FjMTJkZmJmMTA5NmMy"><span style="font-weight: 400">As the AI promised, all words on the display were changed to Japanese. At least now I wasn’t completely adrift.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MGFkM2E1ZjRiNTRmNTNiMDlkZGEzNWY0YjQ2YjEw"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">But still, do I want to poke around on my own when there’s such a capable assistant right here?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNmODVmZWU1OGEyMjQ1NTA4NDI3MDFmMGNlZmVkMDZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, can you stop what’s happening right now? The installation of the new AI system or whatever it is?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMWFjMjI5ODIwMzQ2YzJiNDJkODBmMDkwMDI4NmQx"><span style="font-weight: 400">The voice took a while to answer. “The installation of the new firmware cannot be stopped without significant risks of corruption of the simulation.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYTcyMTRlZWYxMDQzNzJhYmFlNTI1NzJhMGY4YjY3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then what about stopping the Illumination itself?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMmU1MTMwYjVkYTRlZmZiNzkwYWIzZWRiM2IzYzQw"><span style="font-weight: 400">The voice responded immediately. “The Illumination protocol can only be stopped by the archangels or someone with higher permissions.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YTAwNTcxODBmZjQ0N2Y4MzJhOWRkNTdkZDdlOWZi"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Tsk. So stopping the Illumination is also a no-go? </span></em></p>
<p class="cnNjNTVhMTY4OWZjYTRkNDM5MmJhNWM5YzM4N2RjZTNm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Damn, this sucks. In that case, I need to put someone on the list of people allowed to enter this world. Can you do that?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYTExMWU0ZDdiZDQ0N2U5YzgwMjZmYmU4NjZkN2Y0"><span style="font-weight: 400">The AI responded without missing a beat. “Yes. Please name the individual you wish to add to the whitelist.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YTdmOTFiZDViNTQxY2M4NmVlMGU4NjBkZWUxNDgy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ayumi Toyosaki. She had been removed from the list a week ago. I need you to add her back and then bring her here.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYmU5NGY2ZDQ3NDQ0NGI4ZDNjYmE5ZGI1ZGJiZTY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Certainly. User identified by the name Ayumi Toyosaki has been reintroduced to the whitelist of Divers and notified of the change to the whitelist.” And a beat later. “The user logged in the closest available location, approximately fifteen meters in linear distance from the Controller.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ODI4ZTcxYjhhZTQ1YmZiMDNkN2JjOGRjMDljZDk5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where exactly is she?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxN2I3YWJiNTA2NjRlMTJhNTM0N2YzMjIzMWNiNGEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Outside this structure, on the surface.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYWVjYjBjYWFmYjRhNjFhMWRkYmY3ZjQ1M2YwZjI3"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Logged in? So is Ayumi…</span></em></p>
<p class="cnM0NGRjNjA4OTVkYjRhMTVhOWZlOGU2YjRiNWZmZGRl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Without another glance at the monitors, I dashed outside the room.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMTgyMmM1NmJkMzRjNzBiNjdlNTdkM2Q5NmMxOTg3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks, Miss AI Assistant! You saved the day,” I shouted as I made my way outside.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYjMwZDg3YWUyMzQ5NjNhMmRjMjdjYjM5MzZhOTgz"><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t know if the AI replied or not. If she did, her voice was too low for me to hear among the heavy steps I took up the spiral staircase.</span></p>
