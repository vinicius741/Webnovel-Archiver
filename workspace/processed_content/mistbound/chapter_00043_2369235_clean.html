   Maeryn stood in her airship, only half-paying attention to the nameless experts as they investigated every nook and cranny of the areas that Parlor had been permitted in. There was nothing there. Everyone knew there was nothing there. But it had to be done anyway.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   But Maeryn’s thoughts were elsewhere entirely. Grounded. She and her crew were grounded. How were they supposed to stay in Zephyr? She couldn’t afford to house everyone in the hotel they were staying at, especially since Parlor hadn’t been able to pay them before getting himself assassinated.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   If they couldn’t stay, and they couldn’t go, what was she supposed to do?
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   … Maybe it was time to run away. Break into the airfield, fight anyone that got in her way, get everyone aboard Stonewing, and just leave. They’d become fugitives, of course, but… maybe they could make it work?
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn grimaced. Doing that would make things very difficult in the future, and cut off a lot of good options. They wouldn’t be able to come back to a flying city to restock on food and other supplies, and they might not even be listened to when Dan and Ernesto figured out how to purify the Mist. No, a dramatic escape was last resort territory, for sure.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   There had to be something she could do. She just… couldn’t see it. Maeryn could feel a headache forming as she realized she was thinking in circles.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Captain!” One of the investigators moved to stand in front of her, saluting. “We’ve completed our investigation!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn nodded wearily. “Anything to report?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Nothing, Captain!” The investigator grimaced. “Not that we expected anything. I’m sorry.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Me, too.” Maeryn took a moment to breathe, then gave a tiny nod. “Sounds like we’re done here. Go report to Marshall. I need to go figure out how I’m going to keep my crew fed and watered while we’re grounded.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The investigator saluted her again. “Do you want to grab anything before you go? You seem to have forgotten your captain’s hat in your quarters…”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn blushed slightly, remembering the hat that Frankie had forced upon her. That damn hat…! “No, it can stay onboard. I try not to wear it outside of… of formal functions, and I’d probably lose it if I brought it out,” she quickly improvised.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Right, that makes sense. Shame, though. It’s a nice hat.” The investigator shook his head, then called out to his team. “Alright people, we’re done here! Everybody off the ship!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn watched the team of four people disembark, but lingered in the communal area for a long moment. “Frankie’s going to be so disappointed…” she murmured, feeling a pang in her stomach at the thought of it. Stonewing
  </span>
<em>
<span>
</span>
</em>
<span>
   was her engineer’s pride and joy. And now she wouldn’t be allowed anywhere near it.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn closed her eyes and took a deep breath, releasing it slowly. “This isn’t forever,” she told herself sternly. “We just need to make things work for a while. So get moving, Rin. You have places to be.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   As she left the airfield, Maeryn brought out her notebook and started jotting down some ideas on what she could do. Finding cheaper lodging was a given, as was looking for work. Maybe Terrance would have some ideas on how to find who killed Parlor.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn’s steps stuttered as she abruptly remembered Erina’s suggestion from the previous night:
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    “Look into the Nightshade family. Your rogue friend will know more. You might find some helpful resources there.”
   </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Had… had Erina foreseen this? Or… had she been the one to kill Parlor, and she was trying to make sure Maeryn wasn’t overly impacted? Or was it even connected at all?
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn’s brain felt like it was on fire as thoughts spiderwebbed out from there. The Nightshades were a noble family. Terrance had said they were retainers to the royal family. The royal family had grounded Maeryn because of Parlor’s death. Was it possible that, after the Nightshades were killed, the Parlors took over those duties? Was Samuel Parlor a Nightingale?
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   She stopped abruptly, sinking onto a nearby bench as her vision blurred from the barrage of possibilities. Taking a few deep breaths, she tried to calm her racing heart and focus. Whether Samuel Parlor was a Nightingale didn’t matter right now.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   What did matter was that the Nightshades had been a noble family. And it sounded like they’d had a home here in Zephyr. If it was still here… if it hadn’t been sold or confiscated… then Terrance was the rightful owner. They’d have a place to rest their heads, and enough wealth to keep them afloat, at least in the short term.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   It could solve a lot of their problems. Maybe. But she cringed at the idea of approaching her friend. “Hey, Terrance, I know you just told us about your family last night, but we’re suddenly in dire straits. Could you take us to your old family’s estate so we can mooch off your legacy for a while?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn shivered in revulsion at the thought, her stomach twisting in knots. But as much as she loathed the idea, it was an option. She just didn’t want to take it.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Let’s see what we can do on our own, first. Places to stay and ways to make money. Come on, Rin. We’ve got all afternoon to find something.” While the self-pep talk didn’t do much to lift her spirits, Maeryn stood nonetheless and hurried off, blending into the crowds as she began her search.
  </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn returned to the hotel that evening, tired and weary. She’d found another hotel that she could check everyone into the next day. It was still pricey, but much more affordable than the place they were currently staying at. They’d only be able to stay for a week with the funds they had left, but it was better than nothing.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Job-wise, she hadn’t had much luck. Maeryn just didn’t have many marketable skills. She was an airship captain without an airship, and a hunter without hunting grounds. The skills she’d learned for crafting and maintaining her vambraces - leatherworking, smithing, stitching, rune inscription - were good enough to get her a job on a different flying city, and might even have been enough here on Zephyr, but Maeryn had encountered an unexpected problem: her clothes.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Every employer had taken one look at her airship captain’s outfit and dismissed her out of hand. “We’re looking for someone long-term,” one shopkeeper had said, his gaze flicking over her uniform with thinly veiled skepticism. “Training you up to our standards would be a poor investment if you’re not planning to stick around.”
  </span>

</span>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn had left the shop feeling a pang of bitterness, her frustration simmering just below the surface. It was the first time her Zephyrian outfit—the airship captain’s clothes she’d purchased on Cloudreach to reflect her position and responsibilities, while also disguising that she was Geovan—had worked against her.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   In the present, Maeryn shook her head, trying to look at the bright side. Now that she had a place for everyone to stay, she had a little bit of time at least. She’d find something by then. Or the grounding would end, surely. Right?
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   With that cheery thought, she walked over to the front desk. “I’m Captain Maeryn. Any messages for me?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The receptionist glanced up at her, then shuffled some papers at her desk, clearly looking for something. “Ah, yes. I have two for you. Here you are. Anything else?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn took the proffered envelopes. “No, that should do it. Thank you.” She began climbing the flights of stairs to get to her room, each step just adding to her exhaustion. By the time she reached her door and walked inside, she was ready to just collapse in bed.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   She dropped face-first onto the bed, releasing a little groan as she did. The soft, cool blanket felt absolutely wonderful against her exposed skin, and the desire to have more of it gave her just enough energy to shuck off her boots and jacket.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   After several moments of blissful relaxation, Maeryn finally rolled over to look at the ceiling. “May as well see what those messages were,” she muttered, pulling them up to her eye level.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The first was from Gwen, following up on their desire to catch up. She’d invited Maeryn to an early breakfast the next day so they could talk before the hunter had to leave. Nothing unexpected, there.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The second, though… in moments, Maeryn forgot her exhaustion and sat up straight, heart thumping madly in her chest as she reread the message.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
    You need to run as soon as you get this. The Zephyrian Research Council has learned of your involvement with the Undead in Airspire. Don’t try to leave with your airship - they’re waiting for you there. Run!

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Blight!” Maeryn swore, hurling her jacket and boots back on with frantic haste. She burst out of her room and pounded on the door where Dan and Ernesto had been staying. “Dan! Ernesto! Are you in there?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   There was no answer, and Maeryn felt a pit form in her stomach. “No…” She leapt to the next room over, throwing her fist against the door hard enough that she threatened to break it down. “Peter! Frankie! Terrance!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Again, no response. Maeryn’s blood ran cold as reality set in. She was alone. Maybe they were just downstairs, eating? The girl nearly flew down the stairs as she rushed to check, eyes wild as she scanned the communal dining area. They weren’t there.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The truth crashed over her like a relentless avalanche. The ZRC had taken them.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Rage and fear washed over her in equal measure, but Maeryn snarled as she forced herself to focus. She stormed over to the receptionist, her ire palpable. Perhaps literally so - she felt angry enough that it wouldn’t surprise her if sparks were starting to fly around her from her fire magic. Everyone instinctively stepped aside, no one daring to stand in her way.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The receptionist looked up, then recoiled. “I, ah, how can I… help you?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn leaned over the counter, purposely invading the receptionist’s personal space with a terrible scowl. “You’re going to tell me exactly what happened to my crew. Who took them, when, and where they were going. You’re going to tell me everything I want to know. Or else.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Or else… what?” he challenged, though his voice wavered slightly.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn placed her left hand gently on the wooden desk in front of her, and allowed a trickle of her anger and mana to flow. Not quite enough to manifest a fireball, but enough to use a common spell used for introducing someone to fire magic:
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Burning Hands
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   . Her hand grew pleasantly hot, and smoke began to emanate from the slow-burning wood with a crackling hiss. “Let me, what is the phrase? Lay the cloud bare, that was it. My crew is in danger. You know where they are. If burning this desk gets me where I need to be, that’s what I’ll do. If I have to burn this whole hotel to the ground, that’s what I’ll do. And if that’s still not enough?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn raised her right hand and extended the blade from her vambrace with a sharp
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    shink
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   . The steel gleamed in the light, making the threat unmistakably clear. She didn’t need to say anything more - her point, such as it was, was made.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The gasps from the people around Maeryn reminded her that they had an audience. But frankly, she simply did not care. Her eyes did not leave the man in front of him, and she stared at him, daring him to defy her.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The receptionist’s eyes widened as he glanced from the acrid smoke curling around Maeryn’s hand, to the blade in Maeryn’s other hand, then back to the hunter’s eyes. He swallowed nervously. “You… you wouldn’t.” He didn’t sound entirely confident, but Maeryn had to give him points for trying. He had guts.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   That just wouldn’t do. Maeryn had no time for bravery. Not now.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Listen to me.” Maeryn’s voice was calm. Pleasant, almost. The only thing that betrayed her was the quiet fury that burned in her eyes. Well, that and the louder crackling as she turned up the heat in her hand, more and more of smoke wisping up as a result. “Today, I found out that my airship’s been grounded due to forces beyond my control. My client is dead, so I’m not getting paid. I spent all day trying to find more work and found nothing. And now my crew is gone, with a mysterious note that suggests that they were taken from here, by people that I have every reason to believe will kill them.” She abandoned all pretense at pleasantness then, glaring at the receptionist with every ounce of anger in her body, moving her blade perilously close to the receptionist’s face as she leaned in to stage whisper her words forcefully. The smoke around her hand rose up to frame her face, and she did her best not to react to its scent. “Do not think you can tell me what I would and would not do today.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn could see the moment that the receptionist’s will crumbled like brittle shale. The man swallowed nervously, eyes darting around the room and looking for help. Seeing none, beads of sweat began to appear on his forehead, and Maeryn knew she had him. “Y-y-yes, C-c-captain,” the receptionist stuttered, color draining from his face. “I, um… can I… get the names… of your crew? And, um, the room numbers? If you know them?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Frankie, room 401. Dan and Ernesto, room 402. Terrance and Peter, room 403.” Maeryn’s spoke slowly, her unwavering, unyielding gaze boring holes into the receptionist’s forehead.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Ah…” The receptionist was making wordless noises of increasing discomfort as Maeryn kept up the pressure. He flinched as his desk made an especially loud crackle as Maeryn charred the surface. “Right. Them. I, um, there were… a couple of representatives? Of the ZRC? They had some… scary-looking people with them. G-guards, I think. T-they claimed that, that one of them was a n-n-necromancer? They had t-this, this paperwork… I d-didn’t have a choice!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn’s eyes narrowed dangerously. “And when was this?” Her voice was a low growl, promising retribution if she didn’t get a satisfactory answer.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “A-a-about t-t-two hours ago…” The receptionist’s stuttering had worsened, and he was shaking in his chair.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn decided to pull back a bit on the intimidation. Any more, and he might become completely incoherent. She canceled her spell, pulling her hand away. There was a very visible black handprint where her hand had been, and tiny red embers glowed around the edges. “Very good,” she murmured. “Now, where can I find them?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I… I… I don’t… know?” The poor receptionist squeaked as Maeryn’s expression darkened further. “I don’t know!” he repeated, pressing himself against his chair. “M-m-maybe check the ZRC headquarters?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   That was likely the best she was going to get. “Last question. Did they get everyone? Was there anyone missing?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “N-n-now that y-y-ou m-m-mention it… t-there was one p-p-erson missing… T-T-Terrance, I think?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn nodded, and stood up straight, withdrawing her blade back into her vambrace with a dull
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    shunk
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   . “That tracks. Thank you. You’ve been… helpful”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   There was no response from the trembling receptionist, who had sagged into his chair, staring wide-eyed at the hunter as she stalked away as if unsure whether he’d truly been spared. The sound of her boots echoed ominously in the eerily silent hall, punctuated only by the sound of the door closing behind her as she left the building.
  </span>
