<p class="cnM5ZjY3NDNkNmY1NTQwNzE4Y2EzZDRkYjFlMDNlZmRj" style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 1.1em"><strong>Aria</strong></span></p>
<p class="cnNhZmJkYjlhZTg2NTQ3OWY4NjUyMjQ1MDRiZDZhNjcz">So, as it turns out, a lot of people saw me leaving with Pestilence. They also saw Pestilence curing them all while we were talking. And to top it all off, a certain childlike Star went and blabbed to everyone about what I did. Saying that I ‘sold my body to be used for experimentation to save them’ and other crap like that.</p>
<p class="cnMzMmExNmMyMGY0NjQ1YzZhMmVjODk1ZDRhZTY1NmQ2">Which I guess isn’t wrong per se, but I don’t like how it was worded.</p>
<p class="cnMyYmRhY2JjODExYjQ2MTRiMjhmOThlZDcwMTE5YzM1">What’s worse is that I’m already starting to find articles talking about my childlike appearance. Some of which even have pictures <em>taken from this very command center</em>.</p>
<p class="cnNiNjA0ZTZiMzU3YjRhYzFhZDljYWUwYjc2ZjczM2Vh">I turn a glare in the direction that the pictures were taken from just to find some guards in the command center standing stiffly at attention like nothing was wrong. But I can tell from some very minor twitching in their fingers that they’re still fucking taking pictures.</p>
<p class="cnNlOTA1OThkMTY2NDQ5Yjk4N2FmMzk3YmY0NjkzMjAw">Eventually I let out a sigh and shake my head while grabbing a cloak with a deep cowl from my storage ring. One that is far too big for me. Then I simply dismiss my horse and continue my earlier walk over to the entrance while donning said oversized cloak.</p>
<p class="cnMyNmZmMTc5NmU1YjRkMDBiMDI2MmRmYmIzNjFkZjY2">Maybe this’ll work.</p>
<p class="cnM4Y2Y4YzIxMmM0MzRjMjZiZDMwMDU3OGU2Njc5MmVl">I doubt it though.</p>
<p class="cnNkNzVlNTI3ZjljNDRlMDViNzg1YWVjNmVhNWE4YzFi">Now I may just leave this place. Because I don’t want the attention that I’m no doubt going to attract.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZDBlYTg5NmQ0ZDRmNjg5ZmY4ODdkYzRjY2RlZjYz">Especially as I open the command center door into the hallway and begin walking through it while reading more articles. Including articles talking about how I was temporarily turned into an adorable child for the sakes of everyone here.</p>
<p class="cnM2Y2Q2MTcwODEwMjRkZTRhY2MxNTI0NzVhMDE5ZWFk">And the responses to said articles that range from ‘she’s too adorable’ all the way to ‘I want to take her home’.</p>
<p class="cnMwYzQxNzc0NDJhYjRlNjU4ZjBkYTA5OGUwYWZhM2Nk">Completely shattering any image I had as a cool Horseman of the Apocalypse.</p>
<p class="cnNhZDcxMDE4OGQ0MDRlZTY4NTA0NjY3Njg4MTllZmUx">If I ever had one in the first place.</p>
<p class="cnM4MDZjMjI0MDc4MzQwM2JiNGViZWZhMTExOWE3YzY2">I let out a sigh at that thought before stopping right in front of a random door in the hallway as a realization comes to mind. Then I just wait here for several seconds, letting Lyra catch up to me.</p>
<p class="cnMyOTNhMThjYWViZjQ2MDJiOGRhNGVlMDdjNWZkNTI2">“I’ll show you the way to your ship,” she says while smothering a smile and trying not to look at me. No doubt also holding herself back from laughing at how I just left the command center with no idea where the hell said command center even is within the station.</p>
<p class="cnNhMjY4ZjcyNmRiYTQ0YzY4MWYyYzRiOTdlMmMwM2E5">Even Leone looks like she’s struggling not to laugh as she catches up as well.</p>
<p class="cnMyYTUzNDRkOWIzMTQ3YmI5MDE0Yjk5ZmQ0NDQ5NmE5">Unfortunately for me though, thanks to my current distraction, the thought that walking with the Star herself through the station might inform everyone looking about who I am doesn’t cross my mind until we leave the locked off part of the station and enter the inner station. The part still blocked off from the public but not blocked off to the regular, everyday denizens of the station itself.</p>
<p class="cnMwYmI1NGQ1ZGI5MzQ4MDE4M2YxNjE2MWYzNTBiNTUw">At which point said denizens all begin swarming me.</p>
<p class="cnMzMWNjNWFmY2NjMTRkZjhhZGY5Y2UyMTEyYzQ0OGM4">“She’s so adorable!!” “Let me hug her!” “Thank you for saving me and my daughter!!!” “Thank you so much Aria!!” “Thank you for saving my kids!!!”</p>
<p class="cnNjOTQ4ZjAxZjMzNzQ3ZDc4ZGM5MjBiYjM2NDU0Y2M2">My eye twitches and it takes everything I have in me to not pull out my nuke right now.</p>
<p class="cnM5YzNlYjM0YTFhODRkYTk5NWFhZGVkNmIxMzY4Y2Q2">I take a deep breath in as Lyra uses her ability to send everyone near us flying away without harming them. Then I let out said deep breath.</p>
<p class="cnNkYjhiMzBlMzI3NDQ0OGFhODJkMWMzMTFhMTg5MGFi">Right. No blowing up space stations with nukes and committing mass murder.</p><span class="cjk2OTdjNDk1ZDQxYzQ0ZjE5NDE4NGY4NmUyYjg1Yzc1"><br/>Unauthorized duplication: this tale has been taken without consent. Report sightings.<br/></span>
<p class="cnMwZTA1YmE3MjRjZTQ4N2Y5M2Q5Y2QzZjVmMDY0Y2Yy">I may like nukes, but most people don’t.</p>
<p class="cnNjNWFiNjhlMjdiZTQyYjk4MDc2Mjc4NjQ4MTY2OWU4">Just gotta keep thinking that.</p>
<p class="cnNjYTUxZmE2MTliNDQyYjFiNzMyNmM0OGNkZTNmYzE4">Fortunately for me, I don’t have to hold myself back much longer. Because we soon reach a flying limousine and enter the thing, taking off into the air and ditching the rabid fans and masses of appreciation.</p>
<p class="cnNiYmVlMmZhYjE0YzQyOWI4YzI5ZmVkNDg3YzAxOGZk">Finally letting me breathe in the process.</p>
<p class="cnNmNDQ1NjIwYTYzOTQ2MTBhMWFmODQ5YzEwZTQzOTQ4">I turn to look at Lyra to find her still hiding her smile behind her face. Meanwhile Leone isn’t even bothering to hide anything as she openly grins at me.</p>
<p class="cnNlZGIxYTJkYTc5NjQxZjliNDkxZWY0MmZjODY5NzM4">“Keep grinning like that and I’m gonna make you clean my ship top to bottom every week,” I tell her with a glare on my face, instantly wiping the grin off her own.</p>
<p class="cnM1ODZjZWFiMDFmODQ2NzE4OWM0Y2FlY2U1ZDRiYWMx">I turn to look out the window at that, still ignoring Lyra as I do so.</p>
<p class="cnNhOWQ1YTYwMjIyZTQ4YmM4YTUyMjg2NjE4OGUwMTU4">Putting aside all of this attention though, there isn’t much wrong with my current situation. Since I should be able to hide in the Fracture, or rather, hide inside of the Plane of Death while my Death Spirits hunt for me.</p>
<p class="cnM5YTUzOTE5M2NmYTQ0NThiZTNiNzZmZmE1Mzc4ODk2">And I can stay there for several years. Until this all dies down at least.</p>
<p class="cnNmYjcxYjBiNTUyNzQxOTBhMmNlNTY1ZmVjMmE3ZmU5">Meanwhile Lyra owes me bigtime.</p>
<p class="cnMxNzZhNGFiNDUxYjQyMzA5ZWQxNDZlOGUxYzVjNGE3">More importantly though…</p>
<p class="cnM5MDhiODFmNmU1MTRkNGZiNTRmYzRlNjcwYzlmNTky">As if reading my mind, Lyra says, “I’ve already transferred the factories to your name. Your secretary, the Princess of Atlantis, is handling the affairs as we speak.”</p>
<p class="cnMwYjkyMTVhZDA3YzRjN2Y4M2YzMzNjODk2ZWEyOTlm">“Good,” I respond with a faint smile spreading across my face without turning to look at her.</p>
<p class="cnNkYTM4N2ZmZGI2ODRlODBiY2NlMDU3OGM3YTlhMGI5">Very good.</p>
<p class="cnM5MTIxMTNlYTcxMTQ2M2M5ODhjMTE5NzdlMzBlZDdm">Now I’ve finally got my own explosives factories and won’t have to bother with buying explosives all the time.</p>
<p class="cnMwMGFkMTBkMWVhZDQ1ZGFiMGViM2Y2MGJjOWMwZjgz">My smile grows wider.</p>
<p class="cnNjZjQ5NDJkODhjNzQ4ZjA4Mzk5ODAwNWFhZDBhYjVh">That’ll make this all worth it. Especially after I eventually leave the Star Link Stations behind. And when I’m no longer in the body of a child.</p>
<p class="cnM1YzJlNDYzZTlhMDQ1NDBiZDcxZjQ4ZTIzMjdjZTVh">At the sudden reminder of my body’s current appearance, my smile falters a little bit. Simply because of what happened the last time I looked like a child and saw Little Blue.</p>
<p class="cnNkYmQyYzhkN2RhZDRmODk4MDg1Y2E1MzE0Y2M2MzRm">Ugh.</p>
<hr/>
<p class="cnNjZWM0YjZjYzRlNDRjNjc4ZWFiM2UwZDcxN2IxMWVm" style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 1.1em"><strong>The Main Office of the Pale Mercenaries on Eternus</strong></span></p>
<p class="cnNkOGI1MGU2OWMxYjRiOTNhZGM1ZTdmZmRhYTkxMGIz">Nerissa Atlantus Azurion, or as Aria likes to call her, Little Blue looks up from her paperwork with a smile. Something she hasn’t done while working on paperwork in a while. Simply because of the exact paperwork she’s currently filling out.</p>
<p class="cnM2NzY3ZjMwZGE3ZDRiOWZiYzRhMjQwY2E0NmEzZTU3">Paperwork regarding the transfer of around a dozen different large explosives factories from the Second Star to her aunty, Aria Crimson.</p>
<p class="cnMzYjQ1YjhhOGEzNzRhOTBhMjNkNzEyZDZjNmRhYTM2">Not only does the paperwork signify a lot less work for Nerissa in the future, since she won’t have to fill out anywhere near as many purchase forms for her aunty’s explosive obsession, but it’ll mean less work for the company as well. Since they haven’t entered the weapon’s industry as of yet. And having a place in the industry now means their company will be better supplied with explosives.</p>
<p class="cnNiOTYzNzM4Yzc3YjQyOTJhZTBkMGI0NjdmOWMzODhm">But the two most important reasons for her smile are completely different. And they are both interlinked.</p>
<p class="cnNlMmI3ZjM0MTJkNDQzODc5OTYzNGE2YzcyNDIzOWM1">Nerissa will be going to the Second Star soon to deliver some paperwork regarding these new purchases to her beloved aunty. Something she knows her aunt will absolutely love.</p>
<p class="cnM1NTZmNTk0M2E4ODQ1OGY5NTNjZTBjZWY5OGVhZjkz">And more importantly than that, she knows from the news flooding out of the Star Link Stations that her aunt is currently in the form of a child once more. Which means Nerissa will have the chance to snuggle her again.</p>
<p class="cnMzYzcwOGY1MmQzZDQ3NmM4ZDYzODBkMmZkZTNkYmFh">Before her aunt blows her lid. Both literally and figuratively.</p>
<p class="cnM4MzRkZWYwN2YzMzQyZDZiNDk4Yzc3YWNlZTE3NDcy">Although Nerissa is also happy about the positive reputation her aunty has gotten from this recent development. Since the applications to join the Pale Mercenaries have only shot up even more than before thanks to this.</p>
<p class="cnMwMzNkZDFmYjc1OTRlZWQ5YTE3OTkwZTRkZWVjZDJk">Which does also mean more work, but that extra work is on her sister’s shoulders. Not her own.</p>
<p class="cnM2NDIzNGY4MDBmNTQyZjk5YTQ2NzBjMzZkYzMzMjY1">Most likely they’ll simply add more restrictions onto the qualifications required to join the Pale Mercenaries. Even more than they already had before this.</p>
<p class="cnNjNzdmMDI0MTBiMzQ1OGQ5MGQ2MTBlZDk1ODRmMzNh"><em>And there were a lot before this…</em></p>
<p class="cnM3NjQ3ZmM0NWRiODQ0YWRiZDkxZGI2ODMxNjE5NzI4">Nerissa purses her lips at that thought before shrugging and continuing to work on the paperwork. Putting in the last touches on them before shoving them to the side of her desk and leaning back in her chair while spinning said chair to look out the window.</p>
<p class="cnM1MjUxN2MyYzRjNzQ3ZDQ5MzNmYmJkMDdiZTUxNzU2">Where she sees a massive line extending for quite a ways from the main building of the mercenary company.</p>
<p class="cnMxZWNlZjljMWM2ZjQ4Njg4Njk2NzY1ODBhZTA1NWVl"><em>Maybe we should hire more people to handle the recruitment process…</em></p>
<p class="cnNkOWFiMDQzYzIxMjRmOGNiMjk4Y2NiMGNlOGIxOGE2">She stares at the line for a few seconds, only to eventually just turn around and get up from the chair.</p>
<p class="cnNhYjQxODBjZGI5ZTRiNzZiZjgwYTEwYTkyOTRmMGJj"><em>Right. More importantly, it’s time to go see Aunty.</em></p>
<p class="cnM1OWQ2OWNiMWFkNjQ1OTc4ODQ5ZGIyZjFlZWEzYjZm">A smile lights up her face at the thought.</p>
<p class="cnM3NWQxZDk3YjVjNjRhNTQ4NjgyNjVhMTFlNGMxN2I3">Even if Aria sometimes does things that infuriates Nerissa, she still loves her almost as much as she loves her own parents. More than she loves her own siblings in fact.</p>
<p class="cnNkNWM0MWY0YTQ5NjQ3ODg4YzU5Yjg5OWNkZDQ3MWZm">It’s why she left home to go work under her. And her parents were more than supportive of the decision since it meant establishing permanent ties to Death.</p>
<p class="cnMzZmMzY2Q2ZGIzYzQzMjI5ZWRhYWVlZDU3YTQ3MzA4">Although Nerissa isn’t sure if Aria knows that she left her old mercenary company behind completely instead of just temporarily taking up work as her aunty’s secretary. But at the end of the day it doesn’t matter to Nerissa if her aunty knows or not.</p>
<p class="cnM5NjI2NzBkMDM3NTQ4NDZiMzBhYWRmNzNjYzViZjM5">Part of what Nerissa loves so much about Aria is how laidback and carefree she always is. And nothing will ever change that.</p>
<p class="cnNjZDk4NzFiMTAwMTQ1ZTlhMGMxOWUxZDI5YjVmY2Q2">So with her smile still on her face, Nerissa goes ahead and grabs all of the paperwork she plans to give to Aria before heading straight out of her office.</p>
<p class="cnNjY2E5MTQxOWVlMjQ3ZGVhMDFjZTIyODE2ZTU1NjZm"><em>It won’t be long now.</em></p>
