It looked like it would take a little over four days to get to Vanqor, since we would have to take the hyperspace lane equivalent of a back road, then go <em>off road</em><span style="font-style: normal"> for the last leg of it.</span></p>

<p class="cnMyYjU5MmI1OTQ4NDRhYWRhOWRjZjNjNTZjYzQyZTc4" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">I slowly started lifting my helmet and the lightsaber tapped the side in warning, sparking at the contact but not doing any real damage to the beskar coating. “Let me take off my helmet and I’ll show you.”</p>

I asked a friend in the Temple to check in on them as a favor. They </span><span style="font-style: normal">stopped checking in</span><span style="font-style: normal"> shortly after landing on Duneeden. </span><span style="font-style: normal">They were apparently pursuing a lead regarding the disappearance of the Force sensitive son of a member of the Galactic Senate.”</span></p>

<p class="cnNmMTYzMTdjOTAxMjQ5MzBiMDdmMDFhOTY0NTZiZjg2" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">Frowning, the blonde thought it over for a few moments before asking, “Master Gallia and I found their ship. Some clues led us to Simpla-12,” she murmured. “And that bald bounty hunter? Why were you working with her?”</p>

I answered as I closed up the locker, then moved to take a seat on my own bunk, across from Siri. “My own investigation showed she was involved, helping some mad scientist kidnap Force sensitive people to study for experiments dealing with the Force. </span><span style="font-style: normal">I was attempting to earn her trust and find an opportunity to question her when the two of you showed up. She offered me credits to capture and transport you both to the woman who hired her. </span><span style="font-style: normal">I adjusted the plan to account for the opportunity you presented. You were there for the rest.”</span></p>

<p class="cnMxZWQ1YjQwZDRkNDRjMTZiNjc2MmNkYjk3MGUzM2Zl" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">“Yes, and I imagine one of two things will happen. Either Ona Nobis will slip up and Master Gallia will escape and regain control of the situation on her end, or she keeps your Master tranquilized for the entire journey. Either way, we plan to move forward under the worst case scenario.”</p>

We’ll let her lead us to where they’re keeping the others, then turn the tables. You should be able to free yourself from the cuffs using the Force, and I’ll have your saber on my belt, so you can reclaim that and we can proceed from there according to the situation.”</p>

<p class="cnMzNGIxYTVhY2M3YTRhNWRiMDMzZGU3NDI5MzRlZDg0" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">Siri frowned, “Can we use the Force on the bounty hunter to just get the information out of her? Put her temporarily under our control while we sort this out?”</p>
<p class="cnM0Nzc0YzgxNGIwODRjZmQ5Nzc3ZjM1NGFlNjFmNjc4" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal"><br/>I raised an eyebrow, sending her a skeptical look. “She’s taken down at least four Jedi now on her own.

Now if you’d like to </span><span style="font-style: normal">work together and</span><span style="font-style: normal"> just </span><em>brute force</em><span style="font-style: normal"> it, hold her down with Telekinesis and squeeze until she becomes cooperative…”</span></p>

<p class="cnMwNDhkMTZjOWU1NjRmZTY4YmVmMzhlYWEwNDc2ZmMw" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal">For a moment, Siri seriously considered the option. Eventually, she shook her head. “</span><span style="font-style: normal">That sounds too much like torture.”</span></p>

<p class="cnMzODEyY2JiMjllMzRiZGRiNjE3YTY3YWZhMmM0YzZi" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal">I held her gaze for a moment and Siri sighed, then looked away. “We’ll go with your plan. </span><span style="font-style: normal">It’s probably our best play at this time. </span><span style="font-style: normal">I do have a question, however. How did Nobis manage to subdue a Master and Padawan at the same time? How did she subdue Master Gallia? She can’t be that good.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMDI1OWI2ZDY5ZDRhNzhhOTEwNzM4NDYxYjNiMTdh" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnMxM2E1ZDU4YzMyMzRjZTA4ZmNmNTRkMjAxOTgzMzU0" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<span style="font-style: normal">That assumption could be what led her to defeating them,” I pointed out. “But I believe there’s more to it. We didn’t see how she subdued your Master. They obviously fought, but that doesn’t tell us how the fight ended. I believe I know how she won, however.” At Siri’s motion for me to go on, and her impatience practically shouting for me to spit it out, I told her what I had learned on Simpla-12. “Knight Unduli was ambushed by normal thugs, who took her out with gas. She’s probably using something similar.”</span></p>

<p class="cnM1YzU3N2JjMTc1NjRhNDdiNWM3NjZmMjBhMGZkMGY5" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">I shrugged. “My helmet seals and my suit has its own internal air supply.”</p>

There are a few self-contained breathing units in the locker. You can carry one under your robe and, if they deploy gas, you’ll have it. I</span><span style="font-style: normal">t</span><span style="font-style: normal"> obviously doesn’t absorb through the skin, or Nobis would have gassed herself by now.”</span></p>

<p class="cnNiOTE5YTUxZDI5NzQwNDU5MzMxNmY4ZTRkNmY2YzVl" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<span style="font-style: normal">Okay, that could work,” Siri murmured, nodding. “How long </span><span style="font-style: normal">d</span><span style="font-style: normal">o we have until we get there?

<p class="cnMzZGI0NjM1M2U4NTQ0ZTY5NDNjNDVmYTQ1Y2RkNmFk" style="margin-bottom: 0">The next few days passed slowly, mostly in comfortable silence, save for the sound of the radio—or space equivalent. I had come to loathe what most would call ‘cantina music,’ but there were a few stations that broadcast in the clear in normal and hyperspace and played decent enough music.</p>

<p class="cnMwMDkyN2MzYjFmZjRlMzY4NzA0YmE5NmY4MTI4N2Fi" style="margin-bottom: 0">Siri was quiet and focused the entire time. There were intermittent moments of worry, presumably for Obi and her Master, but those were always smothered with more study, meditation, or physical training. She wasn’t a big conversationalist, but I was fine with that. Long stretches of silence didn’t instill me with a need to fill them with pointless natter.</p>

<p class="cnM2OWYwNzFlMzcwNjRkZGQ4NjAyNzE3ZGMyODZkZWI4" style="margin-bottom: 0">That’s not to say that we didn’t speak at all, or that the thing we did the entire time was training. No, proper mental rest is just as important as sleep for absorbing and retaining information and maintaining one’s mental health. Our conversations tended to happen around meals or at night, before bed, and generally revolved around mundane things. The planets we had been to were a favorite subject of those talks. When we weren’t talking, Siri borrowed one of my tablets and quietly read one of the books I had stored on them—another thing she enjoyed talking about. Given just how much free time a Jedi, or prospective Jedi could have, it was no surprise that she was as well-read as she was.</p>

I had been regularly attempting clairvoyance to discern her location and check up on her directly, but things had been going poorly. For some reason, Obi <em>at this current time and place</em><span style="font-style: normal"> was hard to discern and it took some backtracking and a bit of work to figure out why. Any attempts to see her in the future were </span><span style="font-style: normal">either hazy or so fragmented by possibilities that I didn’t bother</span><span style="font-style: normal">, while attempts to see her right now were obscured.</span></p>

The </span><em>why</em><span style="font-style: normal"> of her being hard to find in the Force was actually simple to understand once I found her there. </span><span style="font-style: normal">The same Force nexus that veiled the Jedi’s senses had also somewhat cloaked the presence of those affected by it in the Force, making them harder to discern.</span></p>

She was in a holding cell of some sort, strapped to a bed with an IV in her arm, pumping her full of sedatives.

<p class="cnMxMDY3YWJiZmM1YTRhMjNhYTllY2ZjNzE5YTAxNjlj" style="margin-bottom: 0">Five days into our trip, my ship’s computer began beeping, letting us know the timer before we dropped out of hyperspace was nearing its end. With an hour to go before dropping out of hyperspace, I began preparing.</p>

<p class="cnMwYThhOTU4MzgyNjQ2ZmI5NTY0N2U5OTE5OGNkZDA2" style="margin-bottom: 0">Closing my eyes, I projected myself ahead—not to the lab, but to the converted mining facility turned pirate base where it resided. Making my way into the generator room, I quickly found what I was looking for. Buttons pressed and switches flipped as I started a safe power down sequence for the facility’s generator, timed to shut down shortly after we arrived.</p>
<p class="cnM1NTVlZDAwYWMwNjQyMDliYjA4NDUxOTQyMjU0N2Fk" style="margin-bottom: 0"><br/>Next, I slid through the walls to the lab. Finding the madwoman’s computers, especially the one connected to her lab security system, I projected my senses inside and used the Force and a bit of lightning to disable them in a blast of sparks that sent the scientist into a shrieking fury as she began cursing the facility’s shitty infrastructure. With Zan Arbor suitably distracted, I moved through the walls to the cells. Once inside, and with the security now disabled and thus unable to record what I was about to do and warn her ahead of time, I began removing the IVs from everyone.</p>

<p class="cnNiODQyZWIxOTVlMDRmOWJhNDNjZGIxOGJiZWYxNjMx" style="margin-bottom: 0">As soon as that was done, I made my way first to Master Qui-Gon. Focusing on the Force technique I’d learned for neutralizing poison, venom, and other chemicals, I got to work. Within only a few minutes, he began to stir, before sitting up groggily and looking around. Noticing that his IV was off, he asked out loud, “Is it time, then?”</p>

I left him there, cutting out the projection of my body, and moved to do the same for Knight Unduli. As soon as Master Qui-Gon heard her moving around, he called out and let her know what was going on as I moved to help Obi. By the time she stirred, I was wiped and forced to pull my senses back.</p>

Closing my eyes, I opened myself up to the Force and began meditating, trying to refill my reserves in what little time we had left.</p>

<p class="cnM3ODcyZDM1MTYwNTQ4NmE5MjE3N2U2OGNjYWMzZWJh" style="margin-bottom: 0">Vanqor was a rocky, crystalline planet with a blue-gray hue. Scans indicated a high concentration of silica dust in the atmosphere and storms of the stuff swept the planet, visible from space. As we passed through the cloud layer and got lower, it became clear that the landscape was actually rather colorful, with its large crystalline formations, deserts, canyons, highlands, and the occasional bit of plant life adapted to survive in the environment hidden away in valleys shielded from the silica storms. Surface water was few and far between, however.</p>

Scanning the interior of the hangar as the hatch rose and close again, I locked in the parts of the structure holding it up. “Arthree, keep the ship ready. We may need to leave in a hurry.

Looking around, I took in the place we’d found ourselves. It matched everything I had seen when projecting my senses to this location. It was apparently a pirate base of some sort, though I got the sense it was just a stopover to do some minor repairs and trade.</p>

As she did, Nobis stared at me the entire time, radiating expectation and suspicion. On my shoulder, I felt Siri stiffen and a flash of anger pour off of her, but a squeeze of her thigh in my hand and a directed empathic burst of <em>calm</em><span style="font-style: normal"> towards her caused her to still and loosen up.</span></p>

She got her light whip up and on, but was unable to intercept the bolt before it landed with deadly precision and pulped her skull.</p>

The pirates were too distracted by the blaster fire to notice the grenade landing in the middle of their group—a mistake many of them didn’t survive as it went off and took out the cluster it’d rolled into.
