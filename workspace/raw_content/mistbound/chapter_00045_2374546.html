<p class="cnNjZTEzNTI2ZmU1YzRkMDBhNGQ5M2RiY2UyNjc4YmEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Somebody stop her! It’s just one girl!” </span></p>
<p class="cnM2MGZjMjM2YjI4MTRmYTFhMzUyYzAzMmJkZWZjYjMx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you think it’s so easy, you try!” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZjkzM2JkMGVjNDRmN2E4ODM4NTg2MWFmODBiMjBj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Chaos ruled in the lobby of the Zephyrian Research Council Headquarters. The high ceilings and marble floors only amplified the shouts and the clatter of boots and weapons. Maeryn was in her element, her Zephyrian airship captain jacket tossed into a corner to give herself maximum range of motion. Her twin blades flashed in the dim lighting, her movements a blur as she darted from one guard to another, never staying in one place long enough to become a target. She swept the legs out from one guard, then used the momentum to leap sideways, narrowly avoiding a spear thrust aimed at her before using her left blade to deflect a sword strike.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZDZkNzg3ODhmNjQwZTU5YTI1NjA4OTY5OTc0NmY3"><span style="font-weight: 400">She hadn’t had any solid hits against her - just a few scratches and superficial cuts from being just a little too close to an edge as she dodged and weaved past various attacks - but Maeryn could tell that the tide was turning against her. The guards weren’t shying away from lethal attacks, and the cacophony of noise had drawn in more guards from outside. Her skill and speed were allowing her to keep up, but it wouldn’t last forever. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiNDk1MmM5MzMyMDRmNmVhYjNmNmQ0YzlhZjc5NDgy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her eyes narrowed, and her lips peeled back to bare her teeth as she realized that her current approach wasn’t working. She’d been careful not to land any actually lethal blows, restraining herself to gashes and disabling strikes, but that was more exhausting than simply killing them. The longer she took here, the less time she’d have to find her friends and get out. She had to either commit to killing them - which wasn’t ideal - or use her trump card early. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlMDgzZmI2ZDk5NzQ0MTNiMTNkNjZhYWRiM2JmOWIy"><span style="font-weight: 400">So be it. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2YjNmZjI0NjI5YjQ0NjRiZTczMmI4ZjIyOTE1MzMz"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">“Body Enhancement…</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” she breathed, letting mana flood her muscles, bones, tendons, ligaments… everything. Power rushed through her, and time seemed to slow even further for her as she felt her body coil, ready to unleash explosive might. It was time to end this. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3NDNkNDJmZWE5MDQzNWU5MWI0MzM0ODBkYzIwNGNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Blight!” one of the guards swore as she went on the attack once more, blurring between them. Maeryn finished backhanding one guard into a wall, knocking him out, and then dropped low to avoid a fireball to the face. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkNmEwMzQ2Y2E5ZTQyYTY4NGIyNmE3YmQ3OGNkZThk"><span style="font-weight: 400">The near miss filled her with indignant rage - they’d tried to burn her face off? There was only one answer for that: returning the favor. She flipped her own hand up to return the favor. “</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Fireball!” </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">she spat maliciously.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNTYzMDE3MTgxZjRiNzU4YmEyZjBkN2E2ZDM5MzQ0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her aim was true, and she hit the mage who’d cast at her straight in the chest, knocking him backwards and setting his shirt ablaze. She tried to ignore the mage’s scream as he frantically tried to put himself out, moving on to a pair of guards and knocking their heads together before they could react. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2MWVjYTMyMmZmMjQ3NWVhYWU0MzQ4YjM5YjFhNjMx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Empty night, what under the sky are you?” another guard stammered, his weapon clearly shaking in his trembling hands. He clearly had no idea how Maeryn was doing this.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0N2E2ZjNmMzY2NDRlZjNhMzE1NjQzMWUxNTM3MWE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn had already moved on, landing a savage kick to another guard’s ribs, his chest giving off a nauseating crunch as Maeryn broke a bone or two. The guard crumpled to the ground soundlessly. Maeryn had no time to gawk, though. She flung herself to the side and came up with a roll to narrowly avoid another spear strike. She retaliated with a strike to the side of the spearman’s knee, which gave off an audible pop as she purposely dislocated it. The guard collapsed to the floor with a shriek of pain. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhMDNlNTE3MGE0ZDQzNGFiNzFhMjkyYjBlMmM0MmQx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally getting some room to breathe, Maeryn finally responded to the stuttering guard’s question: “Somebody you shouldn’t have pissed off! Where are my friends?!” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiZDA1MzFmMzdjNTRjNmFiNDU0ZGI0ODBmZGQwNmNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">She was bluffing; she couldn’t keep up </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Body Enhancement</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> for long - every superhuman movement she made strained her body. Too much more and she’d overstress the connective tissues between her bones and muscles, and simply collapse, unable to move. She couldn’t feel it right now, not with her spell active - one of the side effects was dulling the pain - but she was going to be hurting later. The only question was how much. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0OWY5ZTU4ZmQxYTRjOTI4ZDQ0ODZlMjQzZjNmNzU0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’re here, Maeryn!” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzZDg2NTliNjZlYTQwMmU4NjhjOGEwNzE0ZmUyMjM0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn’s heart leapt as she recognized Dan’s voice, and a moment later her four missing companions rushed into the lobby, quickly coming to stand behind her. She had to restrain herself from pulling them all into a giant hug, keeping her focus on the remaining guards in front of her. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyN2MxZDUwZDRmMzQyZjRhN2Y2NDRlOWFiY2FiNWY4"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a long moment of tense silence, with neither Maeryn nor her opponents quite sure what to do next. Maeryn swallowed, then pointed at a random guard, choosing to talk to him in particular. “You. I’m going to take my friends now. We’re leaving. You’re going to let us go, and if anyone asks, make up whatever story you want as long as our names stay out of it. And then you’re going to give your bosses a message from me. Got it?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhZmFjODZkMDY5YjQ3MWFiOTRhMTlmZmQ5YzkyNzU2"><span style="font-weight: 400">The man she’d chosen looked like he was about to faint. His eyes darted between Maeryn and his fallen comrades, his voice a hoarse whisper. “I… okay. What’s the message?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlNzMzMDIyZjEzMTQ4YmZhZjg4ZGU4NzIyMDk0ZGUx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn took a deep breath, her heart still racing from the exertion she’d just gone through. “Tell your bosses that if they try this wyvern shit again, I’m going to tell all and sundry about the Undead Necromancer Keith Laurant. Right before I come here and do </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">this </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">again. And next time, I won’t be so considerate about who lives and who dies.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0OWExYWVlMTliMjQyZTBhYjRjOGQxZjBjMzc5MzM2"><span style="font-weight: 400">The guard swallowed, his Adam’s apple visibly bobbing in his throat. “Yeah. Yeah, okay.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjOGUxZmM3MmEyMTQ3NDhhZWU2OGM4OTM0ZGRlZmEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good. Frankie? Get my jacket, please.” </span></p><span class="cmY1YzE5MTVlYjE3ZTRiNDA5YzllOTAwYWFlOTFlNGNi"><br/>This novel's true home is a different platform. Support the author by finding it there.<br/></span>
<p class="cnMxODE1Yjk4OWU1MjQzNmQ4Y2VhNzRmODkxOWJlZmM5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Already got it, Captain.” Frankie held up the jacket in her hand. Maeryn wasn’t quite sure when she’d done it, but she wasn’t going to question it. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTZhZGRiOWY0NTRmMDI4YjM3YjFmNjVjZWFhOWEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Perfect. Guys? Let’s go.” Maeryn moved towards the front door, turning sideways to keep half an eye on the remaining guards. They made no move to stop her, instead rushing to tend to their fallen. The mage she’d blasted whimpered - his chest obviously badly burned. Maeryn felt no regret at all for that injury though - he’d tried to hit her in the face. As far as she was concerned, he’d brought it on himself.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMjczYjRmNDAyZDQ5NmQ5MWZmYmI2OTRmMDI4ODg5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Keith,” Ernesto ordered. “Check for an ambush.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3OTQ0Y2FjNzhjMzRlYTA5NjQ3YWFjMGQ5Nzg1MDhh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn’s neck prickled as a familiar, if ethereal, voice replied quietly. “Yes, young master.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwMTA4NDJmZmJiMjQ1OTk5NGZmMjEwZjM1OWZmMGYz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Wait, she recognized that name. She’d just used it a minute ago, after all. Maeryn’s eyes flicked towards Ernesto, but she swallowed her questions. There’d be time for them later. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwMWFhMzAyNTI3MjQyYmM5M2E1YTdjZjRlNTEyMDZl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It is safe to depart. No ambushes await you.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlYjBhMWE2ZDFhNDRiM2JiNGMwYzJiM2I0YzA0ZDAx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks.” Ernesto half-turned towards everyone else. “Come on. The skyway’s clear. Let’s go.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNkMmRjY2E0MGVkNDRmZGE4ZTIxNGRkOWUwN2M2NWE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn took a deep breath, then nodded, and fully turned her back on the guards, trusting her companions to warn her if they did something stupid. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Body Enhancement</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> was already wearing off, and her muscles ached horribly. She left the building, accompanied by her friends, and quickly led them all to one of the darker alleys she could spot. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzNTVkZWExYzBjZTQ4MmE5MTIyMDdkZWZlYjQwYzg2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Only when all of them were safely out of sight did Maeryn slump against the wall of the alley, allowing her exhaustion to show as she crumbled to the ground amidst the startled yelps of her comrades. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzMjU5YWJmNzg3MDQxNzE4YmY1NzUwNDliYWM3Yjc5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maeryn!” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmZjNjMzkxZDIwNTQwMzc5MzgxNDY5ZTAxMmUyNzRl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rin!” </span></p>
<p class="cnM2NWI1NzA1YWJiNzQ5ZTc4OWZiZGJhMGFlMjI1ODky"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Captain!” </span></p>
<p class="cnM1M2U4OTI5YmVlMzQ5MTZiMmI1MTFiN2Y3NzE3OTlm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m fine, I’m fine. Mostly,” Maeryn amended, wincing as her legs throbbed. “Just… pushed myself a bit too hard. Used </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Body Enhancement</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> magic and went beyond my physical limits, so I gotta pay the toll. I’ll be okay. Just need a bit to rest.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNkY2QzMTI3NmM1MjQ2NmJiYzNiOTFiZGQzYTg3OWNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not surprising,” Dan conceded, crouching and balancing on the balls of his feet as he gave her a quick once over. “There were a dozen or so guards in there. Are you hurt?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyOGE0YjMwNjU5ZDQzZjliNDNlNjhkZjNkMDRiOWY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just a few scratches. Nothing serious.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNTY4ODM5NTNlNzRmODU5ODk3MTUyMzllMDA1M2U1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re sure?” Dan probed. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjVhYTY2YzI4NTQyYjI4MDc3OTZiMWJkNTBmNWRk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn chuckled weakly. “I’m sure. You would’ve noticed if I was bleeding out by now.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyOGI1MTE4NTczZjQzNjViOTQ3NzY0YWVkMTVmMTM0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I looked her over on the way here. She’s telling the truth,” Frankie joined in, backing her up. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmZjU2OWVhZDcxMzRkNjE5OTg2N2Q1NjFjYWJjYjQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Peter shook his head in disbelief. “So, let me get this straight. You’re able to fight over a dozen guards to a standstill… when you were fighting to disable and they were fighting to kill you… and the only backlash you have at the end is a full-body sprain at the end?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0MGU2ZjE2MDIyYzRlNmJhNmJjNTY4MTc3ZTQ5Njlh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s about the size of it,” Maeryn admitted. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlZDA1OGRkOGVmMTRhZTQ5MmM2MTQxOWIwMGI4NjY1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Captain, you’re freaking scary,” Peter told her flat out. Ernesto silently nodded along, looking more than a little awestruck.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0Zjg3NjRlN2MwMTQzZTliY2RlNzhkZjFjMTgzMGI0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, well, I can’t do that again anytime soon,” Maeryn retorted, doing her best to breathe deeply. She grunted in pain as she shifted her weight, clearly feeling the ache in her muscles. “</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Body Enhancement </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">is a last resort for a reason. The harder I work my body when I’m using it, the more time afterwards I’m going to need to heal. And I wasn’t exactly holding back. It’s going to take me a couple of days before I can walk without pain, and a couple more before I’m back to fighting shape.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwODAyMmI0N2M4MzRiZTg4MTdhNjQwMjU0NzM2NjYy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her team glanced at each other, before Dan stepped in. “So, what’s the plan, Captain?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0OGUwNWM1OGVkYzRhNTg5ZTZhNWMzOWIzZTI1M2Q0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“First, we need to find Terrance. Or put ourselves in a place where he can find us,” Maeryn decided. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxODQ5MTFjMjczODRhMzViMTRmMmQwYmIyODc5ODYy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’ve got a plan for that, Captain,” Ernesto supplied. “I, um, figured out the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Summon Spirit </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">spell. Keith’s with us right now as a ghost.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZTk0ZDdiN2E4YTQwNzE5N2E1OTU1YzUwMDM0Y2Vl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Keith materialized over Ernesto’s shoulder, giving a little half-bow in Maeryn’s direction. “Hello again, Captain Maeryn d’Vert. A genuine pleasure to see you again.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM4OTU1NTgzZWI1MTQxNjFiY2MwOGE5MTJjODRjNmRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn swallowed her first two responses, choosing not to voice them. Instead, after glancing at Ernesto, she gave Keith a nod. “Likewise. I’d greet you properly, but…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MjE0YWZlZTA4NTRmZjY5ZjgxMTUwNjg4MjJiNTA2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t concern yourself with it,” Keith interrupted, a hint of warmth in his voice. “I witnessed how hard you were fighting to rescue the young master. A magnificent display. As far as I’m concerned, so long as Ernesto chooses to stay by your side, I’m at your service.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5NjFlODM0ZDAzMzQwMjM5ZTc0YjY5ZDhkYjE1YTEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn could only blink at that. She had never, in her wildest dreams, ever anticipated having a… ghost butler? Was that was what happening here? A ghost butler had joined the team? “... Right. Thank you, Keith.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0NGMwM2YxZTI5NTQ2MTI5MWE2Mjk4Yzc3MjI3ZWQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Captain,” the ghost acknowledged, bowing his head. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiNTM2ODUzYzBmOTQ5N2RhOTIxMTFkNzE0YjA2ZWZk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“... Okay. Ernesto, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">why, </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">exactly, did you summon Keith Laurant?” Maeryn asked, still trying to wrap her brain around the odd development.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZWE0NDU5YjhhMDQyNGQ4YWM1ZDk3MmRiY2E0ZWRl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto rubbed the back of his head, looking just a little sheepish. “Well, basically…” He filled Maeryn in on the underground cells, and how he’d chosen to summon Keith in order to use his supernatural chill to destroy the bars, and hopefully get some necromancer tutelage. “After he learned that I use my necromantic powers to make cheese, he got really excited, and… well, he said he wants to stick around and see how I grow.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzODM4MmRiNDkxZjRiMTE4OThjYThjNmY4ZjY2MzUz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see.” Maeryn rubbed her forehead, trying to stave off the oncoming headache. “Right. Well. Ernesto, you said you had a plan to contact Terrance?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM2ODExMmE3MDhlODQ4NDk5MWUwNGM2MWM2YWQxODgy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Basically, Keith will be teaching me a new spell that will let me reach him and pass on a message. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Spirit Walk</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” Ernesto explained. “I should… probably be in a safe place before I start practicing, though. It sounds like my body will be pretty defenseless when I cast it, and I don’t like how close we still are to the ZRC.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM4YTIxODE2OTIyMzRiMWZiMDc4YTI5NjA3MmVkNjYw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn grimaced at the idea of moving, but couldn’t disagree. “Right. Can I get a hand up? I think I can walk, if someone lets me lean on them.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjM2M1MzI0OTA1NDQyZGZiZTkwZDdiNGFkYTY0OTlm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ve got you,” Dan volunteered, using both hands to help pull Maeryn to her feet. The tiny whimper Maeryn let out as she got her legs underneath her made everyone cringe. Dan quickly positioned himself under Maeryn’s shoulder, doing his best to take as much weight off her as he could.  </span></p>
<p class="cnMxM2Y1NGU4OTU5MTQ2ZTU5ODFlNTYxMzBkNTk3NWUy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s find a place near Skyflower Park,” Frankie half-suggested, half-ordered, pointing in the general direction they needed to go. It was obvious she was unwilling to put Maeryn in more pain than she had to, and if they were going to meet Terrance there, it didn’t make sense to move her more than once. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2NjE2ZjNhMmQwYTQ0NmViM2RmY2Y4OWUyMzVlN2My"><span style="font-weight: 400">She got a round of nods, and the five humans—and one ghost—began slowly making their way through the alleys in the direction Frankie had indicated. </span></p>
