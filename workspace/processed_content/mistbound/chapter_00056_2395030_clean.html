   After Ernesto’s breakthrough, Maeryn lost track of everything else. She vaguely remembered giving a few orders. Frankie and Dan carrying the bodies of the dead necromancers to some place in the back of the airship. Dan did something to preserve the bodies, Maeryn had no idea what.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   They left Zephyr and flew for a while. It took Maeryn a couple of days to realize that she’d ordered them to fly to Mount Peace; Ernesto had wanted to tell the grave of his Master everything that had happened, and Maeryn had unthinkingly agreed to it in the wake of his accomplishment.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The days raced by and Maeryn barely noticed. She was too stunned by the fact that Ernesto had actually succeeded. That he’d successfully created holy mana. He’d done it. The hardest part of their journey was over.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Dan was still struggling to use holy mana himself - no idea why - but that didn’t stop him from feverishly revising his designs on a
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Purify Mist
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   rune sequence. He planned on testing it in the areas surrounding Mount Peace once they arrived.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn was glad. Happy for them, even. But… it was all happening so fast. Too fast. She couldn’t keep up. It was as though her brain was still stuck on that moment, that moment where Ernesto had first channeled holy mana.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   They were almost done.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   She’d left home a month ago, and she’d succeeded. Maeryn had led a team to fix the Mist problem. Her journey was almost over.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   She could go home soon.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   All those years of fighting mana depletion, of trying to stave off the Mist, and Maeryn had gotten together a team and accomplished it a month after leaving home.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   So much had happened in that month. It all felt so… surreal now. Had it actually happened? Was she dreaming?
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn blinked, and she was sitting on her bed, practicing with her guitar. She blinked again, and she was absently making food for everyone. She blinked again, and she was lying in bed, staring at the ceiling. She blinked again, and they were at Mount Peace.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Was she… dissociating?
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Easy, Maeryn. Easy.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Who was speaking? Maeryn slowly turned her head to see Terrance sitting down next to her. Oh. They were sitting at the table in the common area of the airship. She swallowed, her mouth feeling dry and her brain like it’d been stuffed with mothballs. “I…”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “You’ve been out of it since Zephyr. It’s been five and a half days,” Terrance informed her gently. “I think that, in the wake of Ernesto’s success, all the stress and uncertainty and everything just finally caught up with you. I had something like that happen to me back in Cloudreach, after Lorn took me in. It was hard for me to adjust to not being in danger, at first. It’s the same for you, right? You’re having trouble adjusting to the fact that you succeeded? That Dan and Ernesto actually have a working solution?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn could only nod. That was exactly what it was.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Yeah, I thought so. We tried to give you time to come out of it on your own, but looks like you’re having trouble. So I’m gonna do for you what Lorn had to do for me.” He took Maeryn’s hands in his. “We’re gonna ground you back into reality, okay? Take some deep breaths for me. Focus on my hands. On how they feel.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Okay,” she whispered. It took some effort, but she took a deep breath, then another. “Your hands… they’re warm.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Yeah. What else?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn frowned slightly. “You’ve got… calluses. From your dagger.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Good… good,” Terrance praised softly. “Keep breathing. Do you smell anything?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “The… dirt outside.” Maeryn’s head was starting to clear as Terrance kept talking to her, kept forcing her to acknowledge her senses. She looked to the side. “The door’s open? I can smell stuff on the wind. Why is the door open?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance smiled. “There we go. Back with us?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I think so,” Maeryn admitted. “Thank you. I… yeah, I really was just overwhelmed there for a while. I couldn’t think at all. Thanks.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Don’t mention it. Glad I could help.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “It works! It works!” Dan hollered from outside, laughing in sheer joy as he bounded into the ship. “The
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Purify Mist
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   rune sequence, it works! It takes less mana to activate than it gives back, and it collapses the Mist as it does! Maeryn, Maeryn, we did it! We’ve saved the world! We just need to get a bunch of these things made, and that’s it! Depths and damnation, we couldn’t have done it without you giving me the kick in the pants I needed to go on this crazy journey! I could kiss you, you wonderful madwoman!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Don’t you dare. She just came back to reality.” Terrance folded his arms and rolled his eyes.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn looked at Terrance oddly. “Am I a madwoman?” she asked, honestly curious as to his opinion.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Nah. You’ve got clear reasons for your actions. It’s just that those actions end up looking crazy from the outside,” Terrance told her plainly. “Like the whole stealing an airship, masquerading as a Zephyrian Airship Captain, stealing from the nobles, resisting arrest, kicking a bunch of guards around, then literally turning around and saving the flying city that you were trying to escape not ten minutes before. And that was just Cloudreach.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn blushed. “Well, when you put it like that…”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I’m gonna go test
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Purify Mist
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   again!” Dan excitedly stated, ignoring the byplay. “I’m sure I can get holy mana working on my own this time.” Without giving them a chance to respond, he dashed back off the ship.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “You know, I’ve never seen him so hyper?” Terrance commented idly.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “To be fair. This is kinda big,” Maeryn admonished with a smile.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance lifted a nonexistent cup, toasting to her words. “Touche.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   They sat in companionable silence for a few minutes, before Terrance cleared his throat. “So… Maeryn. What’s the plan, then? I mean, obviously, we need to get this discovery everywhere, and get higher ups working how to mass produce the
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Purify Mist
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   rune sequences. So… are we heading back to Zephyr first? Or Geova?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The hunter swallowed. She’d been thinking about that, but wasn’t sure she liked the answer she came up with. “Right now, Ernesto’s the only one who can use holy mana. I think… I think we need someplace as close to neutral as we can get. Get ourselves situated there, at least for now. And just… arrange for deliveries. To both Geova and Zephyria in general.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Neutral, huh? Where do you have in mind?” Terrance asked curiously.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn gave him a ghost of a grin. “How do you feel about sticking it to Lorn, Sipund and Dreen again?”
  </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
   Three weeks later, Maeryn and Terrance stood in front of her workshop on Cloudreach. It’d been repurposed from one of the several warehouses near the airfield, and her crew was hard at work. Frankie and Peter were helping Skymaster Lyra create and maintain airships on the airfield. Dan, Owen, Oscar and Ernesto had formed something of an assembly line for creating
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Purify Mist
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   rune sequences, where the first three would carve the runes into stone tablets and pass them to Ernesto, who would charge them and set them to the side. By this point, they had literally hundreds prepared and stored in the back.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn took a deep breath. She’d sent letters to the king and queen of Zephyria, and the Elders of Geova, inviting them to meet her on Cloudreach with a working solution to the Mist crisis. She’d felt more than a bit presumptuous, sending letters inviting the rulers of both countries to her, instead of visiting them herself, but… she couldn’t favor one nation over another. Her team’s origins were evenly divided across both of them. And besides… the racial tensions needed to end. Forcing them to meet today was the only way she could think of.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   In any case, today was the day they were supposed to arrive.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Breathe, Maeryn,” Terrance murmured softly. “You’ve got this.”
  </span>
</p>
<span>
<br/>
  This tale has been unlawfully lifted from Royal Road; report any instances of this story if found elsewhere.
  <br/>
</span>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn didn’t look at him or respond verbally, but she gave him a tiny nod regardless. Yeah. She had this.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Maeryn d’Vert, you are in so much trouble young lady!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   She absolutely did not have this. “Mom?! Dad?!” Sure enough, Maeryn’s parents, Juniper and Zachary d’Vert, were rushing right towards her, and they did not look happy.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance winced sympathetically, taking a not-so-subtle step away from Maeryn and the incoming blast zone. “Ooh, full name right from the start. That’s rough.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Do you have
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    any
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   idea how worried sick we were?” Maeryn’s father demanded with a scowl. It lasted all the way until he got within arm’s reach of his daughter, at which point he pulled her into a hug tight enough that Terrance was sure he could hear Maeryn’s bones cracking.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   … Had the rogue just heard Maeryn grunt out
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    “Body Enhancement”?
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   No, he was going to ignore that.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Oof! Missed you too, Dad,” Maeryn was able to get out, returning the hug as best she could; her arms were kind of pinned to her sides by her father, so she had no real leverage. “Need to breathe, though!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Zachary d’Vert reluctantly set his daughter back on the ground and looked over her critically. “You’ve been taking care of yourself?” he questioned, in that parental tone that made it clear that it didn’t really matter what Maeryn said, he was going to check for himself.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Yes, Dad,” she told him, clearly resigned to her fate. “I’ve been eating well, I’m not hurt, everything’s fine.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Mmhmm.” Her father’s visual inspection seemed to line up with her words, and he reluctantly nodded. “Honey? Your turn.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   His wife, Juniper, immediately pushed past him. “Maeryn? I love you to pieces, but what in the Unending Depths made you think that leaving a letter and vanishing without a word was at all the right thing to do?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn winced. “Yeah, that was dumb,” she admitted quietly, her voice quavering a little. “I was scared you’d somehow talk me out of it, or talk to the Elders and sabotage our plan to get out. But believe me, I have spent a lot of time since I left kicking myself over it.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Talk you out of it?” her mother echoed, surprise flickering across her face. “Maeryn, you had us convinced in the first couple of paragraphs. And that was before you laid out your plan, with contingencies and everything. We would’ve wanted to come along, is all. Do our part to help, however small.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Zachary nodded along agreeably. “Looks like you didn’t need us, though, considering where we’re at now. Gotta say, I’m proud of you, even if I want to pick you up and shake you some more for making us worry.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn’s heart felt like it was bursting with warmth, but then she grimaced, remembering some of the things she’d done that she wasn’t quite so proud of. “I’ve, um, had to do a lot of shady things, though. A lot of illegal and questionable things.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Zachary and Juniper exchanged glances. “Do we need to plan a prison break?” Zach asked bluntly.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance burst out laughing, unable to take anymore. “You are
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    definitely
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   her parents! Hahaha!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Zachary glanced at him before turning to Maeryn. “So, who’s this? Your boyfriend or something?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Oh, of course she’s not satisfied with the boys in our own country, she had to go find one living in the actual sky,” Juniper grumbled.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn’s face flushed red. “He’s not my boyfriend!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance wiped a tear of laughter from his eye. “Hi. I’m Terrance Nightshade. I met your daughter a few days after she left Geova, and we’ve been traveling together for most of the time since. And no, not her boyfriend. Just a friend.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Looking past her parents, Maeryn was able to see the Geovan Elders and the Zephyrian royalty both coming towards them, and felt panic flare within her. “Mom, Dad, I swear, we can talk about this later, but I really,
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    really
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   need you guys to let me take care of things! I called the Elders and the king and queen of Zephyria here and -”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Wait, you’ve got enough pull to call the king and queen of Zephyria?” Zachary interrupted, impressed. “How’d you manage that?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Not the time!” Maeryn squeaked. “Just, go stand over there for a bit? Please? I promise, I’ll tell you everything later!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Her parents reluctantly moved off to the side, and Maeryn quickly straightened her clothes as best she could under the time constraints. “I look okay, right?” she hissed towards Terrance.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “You look fine. Breathe. You’ve got this.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn glared at him through the corner of her eye. “The last time you said that, my parents ambushed me.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “It’s not like that can happen twice,” the rogue defended himself.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   He had a point. Not that she was going to acknowledge it. Instead, she pitched her voice loud enough to be heard by the incoming government decision-makers. “Elders of Geova, King Duncan, Queen Sona, thank you for taking the time to be here. I know my request for you to come to me was impertinent, but I felt it necessary for several reasons that I hope will become clear soon.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The two groups came closer, stopping a couple of meters away from her but keeping some distance between themselves. Maeryn swallowed, feeling a bubble of anxiety in her stomach, but pressed on. “My team, composed of Geovans and Zephyrians alike, have come up with a working solution to the Mist. It dissolves the Mist and turns it into unaligned mana.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance helpfully held up a glowing tablet. “This is the
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Purify Mist
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   rune sequence. It is extremely cost-effective; it takes less mana to charge than the converted Mist becomes, making it effectively self-perpetuating.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “We’ve tested it on the Mist surrounding Mount Peace - a mountain some days away from here,” Maeryn clarified when the Elders looked at her quizzically. “And my team has been cranking out those tablets as fast as they can. We have lots of them in our warehouse, and they’re ready to be distributed wherever they need to be. That’s where we need you.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “We don’t expect you to simply trust that it works,” Terrance continued, picking up where Maeryn left off. “But testing is as simple as tossing the tablet into a patch of Mist. Check for yourselves. When you’re done, and it works, you - the leaders of our nations - will know better than we do who needs them the most.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “We called you here instead of going to you because both our nations need this,” Maeryn stated clearly. “We can’t prioritize one country over another, not when the solution currently requires teamwork between Geovans and Zephyrians to create.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “How
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    are
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   you creating this?” one of the Elders asked pointedly. “How did you come to this solution?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “And what is the Mist to begin with?” another Elder demanded.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn nodded, having expected the questions. “The Mist is necromantic-aligned mana.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   A few of the Elders, predictably, promptly blew into an uproar. The king and queen of Zephyria, however, had already known, and remained quiet, waiting for Maeryn’s presentation to complete.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   After several seconds of being screamed at, Maeryn lost her temper. “ENOUGH!” she bellowed, taking a single intimidating step forward at the Elders. “Are you younger than I am?! Am I the Elder here? I fully intend to answer your questions, but I’m not afraid to throw you back onto your airship and send you home if you cannot be rational about this!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   King Duncan cleared his throat. “Ahem.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn turned towards him and raised a single, solitary eyebrow. “Do you really think that I won’t do it to you, King Duncan, if you started acting like them? I’m pretty sure your wife would help me toss you out on your ear.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Queen Sona chuckled quietly. “She’s not wrong, dear.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Duncan’s disgruntled expression was delightful, but Maeryn had her eyes on the rowdy Elders. “You three, the ones who started screaming at me? You’ve lost speaking privileges. Sit down and shut up.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   One of them opened his mouth to protest, only to get an elbow to the gut by the Head Elder, Elder Alric. “Sit down and shut up,” Alric echoed, then nodded at Maeryn. “Please, go on, Maeryn.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn returned the nod appreciatively. “As I was saying. The Mist is necromantic-aligned mana. Daniel d’Greenstone, an alchemist from the Alchemical Workshop, discovered this by consolidating his research records from Geova against Zephyrian research findings hosted in Airspire. He and I came up with an idea together to create inverted necromantic mana. Similar to the
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Flame Resistance
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   rune sequence, we wanted to create
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Necro Resistance
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   .”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “But inverting an element requires understanding that element intimately,” one of the Elders protested. “Wouldn’t you need a necromancer?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Yes,” Maeryn said bluntly. “And we found one. Guess who’s powering the
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Purify Mist
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   tablets? You’re not killing this one.” She turned a hardened glare on the Elders and royalty before her, folding her arms confrontationally. “Necromancy is forbidden, with good reason. Everyone knows what happened, the plagues reintroduced by necromancers all those years ago. But it’s time for a change. We need them. You all need to repeal the laws that condemn necromancers to death simply for existing. If you can’t agree to that much at least, then I’m just going to take my people and fly away. I won’t live in a society that condemns its saviors to death for the crime of living.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance took a step forward to stand by her side, silently giving his support and staring pointedly at the king and queen.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   King Duncan chuckled. “You’ve got some guts, Captain Maeryn d’Vert. Giving an ultimatum to a king.” He smiled broadly. “Lucky for you, I agree. It would be the height of dishonor and hypocrisy to deny life to those who give it to us. The law will be reviewed and repealed immediately upon our return. You have my word.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   His acquiescence took the various Elders aback. It took them a few long moments - during which Maeryn fixed her deadliest stare at them - but they too, agreed to repeal the law.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Good!” Maeryn chirped. “Last thing on the agenda. Get international trading going again. The Zephyrians aren’t responsible for the Mist, and neither are the Geovans.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Then who is?!” one of the Elders shot back.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn’s face hardened. “I’ve talked it over with my team, and there’s only one explanation that makes sense. We know now that the Mist is generated by the Undead. But there’s so much of it, covering the continent, even the far reaches where Geovans don’t go.” She looked away from the Elders, from the king and queen of Zephyria, and looked out towards the distance, towards the Mist-covered horizon.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “There are Undead stalking the lands. Powerful ones. The Mist won’t be ended for sure until they’ve been put to rest. That’s the next thing we have to do, after we secure our borders with the
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Purify Mist
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   rune sequences.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn turned back to meet everyone’s gazes. “My whole life has been caught up by the Mist. Bound by it. It’s shaped my choices, my decisions, who I am. Well, I refuse to be Mistbound forever. As soon as we’ve secured our homes, we prepare. We prepare to end the Mist.” She brought up her right arm diagonally across her chest, extending her blade with a flash of mana. It gleamed in the bright sunlight. “We prepare to hunt the Undead.”
  </span>
