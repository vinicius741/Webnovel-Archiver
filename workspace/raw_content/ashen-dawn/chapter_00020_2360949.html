<p class="cnNmNTJhMDhkZjBlODRjY2VhNjE3NWYyODNhY2RiZTU5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo skidded through the mud on his knees, coming to a stop beside Argent's still form. Her skin had already lost its warmth, indigo eyes staring sightlessly at the storm clouds above. He didn't need to check for a pulse to know she was gone.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMDJhNmUxNmI1MTRhNzM4ZTBmNzlkYWVjNDRiY2M3"><span style="font-weight: 400">A few days. That's all he'd known her. A handful of conversations, shared danger, the beginning of something that might have been friendship. But she'd been kind when kindness was rare, had treated him like a person instead of a half-breed freak. She'd been trying to protect people who couldn't protect themselves, had found the courage to face down the bastards who'd tortured her. And now she was dead.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOTMyMTYyMTFhMjQwMzE4OGRkZDg1OTQ2ZWQzNjYz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Because angels - fucking </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">angels</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> - were too busy playing their political games to remember they were supposed to be the good guys.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YzcyMjI1ZGRhOTQ3Njg4YTA0OTdiZDgyZDA4ODdm"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Such a waste," came a cultured voice from the clearing's edge. The man who stepped into view looked like winter, pale skin stark against black hair and immaculate black clothes. Snow-white wings spread behind him, and frost clung to his white-gloved fingertips. His perfect features held nothing but mild disappointment, as if Argent's death was an inconvenience rather than a tragedy.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNzA4MjRmMmM4MzRjZGQ5MTE2MmE3ZjlhZTk2ZmVj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo had never seen this angel before, but the way all the color drained from Kaelan's face told him everything he needed to know.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMDUxNGVlNDdjMzRlMTZiZjZiNWZmOTQ0YzgzZjIz"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Sakurai." The name came out of her like she was choking on broken glass.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTRjODcxODQ2ZDRhMGM5ODZiYzYzMWIxOWVlNDYz"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Hello, Kaelan," the ice angel replied, his tone polite, conversational. Like they were meeting at a dinner party instead of standing over a corpse. "You look well. Command suits you, even if your choice of allies remains..." His black eyes flicked to Vertigo with casual disdain. "Questionable."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NDZiYWI0MjM1MzRjYmI4ZTFkMjgyMDQxZDc5NGE0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Heat flared in Vertigo's palms before he could stop it. The word 'half-breed' hung in the air unspoken, but the contempt was clear enough. It was the sight of Argent's lifeless form that really set his blood boiling, though. She'd been magnificent just moments ago - everything an angel was supposed to be. And this bastard had put an ice spear through her back like she was nothing.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMWU5MDAwNDlhOTQ3ZDNhMzQ2NzExNzZlZWQ5NTI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">"You killed her," Vertigo said, his voice rougher than he'd intended. "She wasn't even looking at you."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NjAyNTlkZDM1YzQyN2JhOTQ0MmEzOTg1NzVmZTA3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Something flickered behind Sakurai's perfect composure - annoyance, maybe, or surprise that a half-breed would dare address him directly. "I am not in the habit of explaining myself to abominations." He turned back to Kaelan with renewed focus. "Kaldi is eager to discuss your recent choices. Are you coming quietly, or shall I make this unpleasant?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMjI2MWVhMGMxOTQ0OTA4NDcwOTQyZjJiMTdlODg4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaelan's stance shifted subtly, and Vertigo recognized the subtle tension that preceded violence. He'd seen her prepare for combat enough times now to read the signs. "I thought you were better than this," she said softly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNDczYWM3MDVlNDRhMzM4NDE5YzFlMTQ4Yzc4NTI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Sakurai's smile was arctic. "You thought I was a lot of things, didn't you?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMGZmZjA2ZjNkNTQzNzJhNmExZGJlNzk4OTM0MGZm"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Yeah." Her voice dropped to barely above a whisper, but it carried like thunder. "I did."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MjkzMGQ0ZjFlYzQ5NTVhNjA0Mzk5MGQ1YTI1MDA4"><span style="font-weight: 400">"And what do you think I am now?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MzQyMDVkMTA4NjQwNTg5MWMzMWMyMzkxMGUxNTY1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaelan's silver eyes met his without flinching. "A stranger wearing a dead man's face."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMTcxZmE0MTE0YzQ2Mjk5OTg1OTk5ZWEwMzI3MWIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">For the first time since his arrival, Sakurai's composure cracked. Fury transformed his features, and when he spoke, his cultured accent fractured around the edges. "You always were too sentimental."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYTZmMGQzZmZhZDRmY2Y4YWNhMTBkOWU3MWYzN2E1"><span style="font-weight: 400">"And you always were a cold-hearted prick," she shot back. "Guess some things never change."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMzE4MjdlY2EwYjRjNTdiZWMzZTA3NjY4M2Y2ZWU2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Movement from the mill caught Vertigo's attention - Mara herding the other captives deeper inside. Smart woman. He envied them their ability to run, to hide, to not be responsible for what happened next.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOTlhNmU2OWVjZjRhNjE5NDJmNjg2MzA2ZjdhYmU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo rose slowly, rage building in his chest. Sakurai was already advancing on Kaelan, ice crystals forming in the air around him with each step. The temperature in the clearing dropped noticeably, and Vertigo could see his breath misting in the suddenly frigid air. Lightning crackled around Kaelan's fingers, her power responding to her emotional state. "I'm not going anywhere with you."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYmNjOGI4OWVmMTQxYjM4N2QwYTdlOTZhMzUwNDEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Sakurai's laugh was like winter wind through dead leaves. "We'll see."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MmI0ZWIwNGEyZjQ0ZTU5ZjFjMmNjY2EyZDUyNTVm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then everything exploded into motion.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTZjYWU4YzEyYjRlYTU5NGJiOTEyZmVmMjJhOWZk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Sakurai launched himself forward with inhuman speed. Kaelan's wings burst from her shoulders in an explosion of black as she sprang skyward, her transformation accompanied by a sound like tearing silk. The clash of steel on steel rang across the clearing - his rapier against her twin daggers, sparks flying where the weapons met. They separated, circled each other in the air, struck again.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkY2Y2NzQ3MzEzMTRjYjdiM2JjN2FjNzI5NDczNzM1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo stood rooted to the muddy ground, watching helplessly as the two angels battled overhead. White feathered wings tangled with black bat wings as they fought, moving so fast they became a blur against the storm clouds. The taste of blood filled his mouth - he'd been biting his lip without realizing it. This was what helplessness felt like. Standing here with his feet in the fucking mud while others fought and died, useless as tits on a bull. Again. And now Argent was dead because he hadn't been fast enough, strong enough, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">good enough</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> to save her.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTI5ZDBmZThjODRkMDJhZGY2ODU2ODZhODYyOTZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Above them, Sakurai's ice magic painted frost patterns in the air while Kaelan's lightning split the sky. Beautiful and deadly and completely beyond his reach. For all their talk about justice and protection, angels seemed to throw life away as casually as mortals discarded garbage. The thought of joining the fight occurred to him - he could throw fire, try to help - but at this distance he was more likely to hit Kaelan by mistake. Just like always, his power was too crude, too uncontrolled to be useful when it mattered.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkN2YyYmNmYWQ5YzRlMWI4M2ZlNWUwZWJmYjg4MWQ0"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">This is what you are,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> whispered a voice in the back of his mind. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Part demon. Part monster. You could end this if you just let go.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNiM2NlZmY5MGIyYzRkNDU5ZjBmYjMzNThiYjg2YWZh"><span style="font-weight: 400">The voice wasn't wrong. He could feel it sometimes, especially in moments like this - a darkness in his blood that promised power beyond imagining if he'd just surrender to it. Raw, destructive force that could level buildings, melt steel, turn enemies to ash. But that way lay madness. He'd seen what happened to Talents who lost control, had watched Commander put down more than one who'd given in to their demonic heritage.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNmM1Njc0ZjBhYTRkOWE4NGIxY2ViZDFhMmRjNzQz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Except what was the point of control if it meant watching everyone he cared about die? What good was being the "better man" if it left him standing helpless while others fought his battles?</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZDA3NmViNmQ4YzRlYTBiNDgyMzRiMmVkOTRhODE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Argent had seen something better in him. She'd trusted him, fought beside him, treated him like a protector instead of a threat. And where had that gotten her? A spear through the back while she wasn't looking, bleeding out in the mud because he hadn't been strong enough to keep her safe.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNmIxMjdlODExODRjMjRhYjBlNWVlNDdmNjYwMmNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">He was tired of being useless. Tired of being the half-breed who couldn't quite measure up, couldn't quite be what people needed when it counted. Tired of watching from the sidelines while the real fighters decided who lived and who died.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOWJhYzMwMjMyODQyYzViYzIwZTI1MTYyOGFhZDVj"><span style="font-weight: 400">A particularly vicious exchange above sent both combatants spinning apart, Kaelan's left wing trailing frost where Sakurai's blade had grazed it. She recovered quickly, but Vertigo could see the strain in her movements. Whatever had happened at the tavern was still affecting her. She wasn't fighting at full strength, and Sakurai knew it.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOTEzNzc1NGY2YTQ2MWNiNzNlNmQ2MWMzZGMwMTYw"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Still favoring your left side," Sakurai called out conversationally as they circled each other. "Some habits never change, do they?" The familiar way he spoke to her, the intimate knowledge of her fighting style - it twisted something ugly in Vertigo's gut. This wasn't just business for the ice angel. This was personal. He was enjoying himself, taking pleasure in slowly wearing her down.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MGI2N2MxYjc5MzRjM2Q4ODM3ZDMxM2NhYWU1Mzhm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaelan didn't respond to the taunt, but her jaw tightened. She feinted left, then struck right, her daggers weaving patterns of deadly silver in the air. Sakurai parried effortlessly, his rapier moving with surgical precision. Ice trailed in his weapon's wake, creating crystalline barriers that Kaelan had to dodge around. Lightning flickered over them but failed to crack them completely.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4Y2ZkYTNkOTg1ODQzMmY4MDg0YTY4N2Y0NDM4YWFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">The fight was beautiful in its way - two master combatants at the height of their abilities, every move calculated and flowing. It was also completely beyond anything Vertigo could hope to influence. He might as well have been watching gods battle for all the impact he could have. That thought burned. Gods. Right. Because that's what angels were, weren't they? Divine beings so far above mortal concerns that they could play with life and death like children with toys. What was one more half-breed corpse to add to the pile? But Argent hadn't been like that. She'd cared about the captives, about the medicine, about helping others even when it cost her. She'd been different. Better. And now she was gone because bastards like Sakurai saw kindness as weakness.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NmI0M2JkNzI2MDRkMTg4YWIxYzgwODNiODdiYTU5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Another clash of weapons rang out overhead. This time when they separated, Kaelan was slower to recover. A thin line of blood traced down her arm where Sakurai's blade had found its mark.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MzhmNmY5MzY3YzRmMzBhNTM0ZDU1NGE4NzQyYjAy"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Getting tired already?" Sakurai asked, hovering just out of reach. "How disappointing. I was hoping for more of a challenge."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNmZiMWM3ODQxYzQ1YWRiYTNiYTI4YTA1OWU4NDFm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo could see what Sakurai was doing. He wasn't trying to end the fight quickly. He was playing with her, wearing her down, demonstrating his superiority. The same way a cat might toy with a mouse before delivering the killing blow. The realization sent fresh rage coursing through Vertigo's veins. This wasn't about duty or following orders. This was about an ex-lover showing off, proving he was stronger, better, more worthy. It was petty and cruel and exactly the kind of shit that made Vertigo hate dealing with people who thought they were better than everyone else.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNDAyZWI4MGE4ZDQyYTQ5YjgwMzMzYTNjYmI4ODc4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaelan's response was a wordless snarl and a blast of lightning that lit up the entire clearing. Sakurai dodged it easily, but his amused expression had sharpened into something more focused. He was done playing around. Ice erupted from his outstretched hands in a coordinated barrage - not just spears, but a wall of crystalline death that hemmed Kaelan in from multiple angles. She twisted desperately, trying to find a gap, but there wasn't one. The ice closed in like the jaws of a trap.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NTQ5NzE3MjkxYzQxNTQ5MmYwYjU4NDYyNWQ0NDdl"><span style="font-weight: 400">At the last second, she folded her wings and dropped like a stone, the ice wall passing inches over her head. But Sakurai had anticipated the move. He was already diving after her, rapier extended, positioning himself between her and the ground.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYzY1MGJjMzg3YzRlZTk4NjVmMzg2ZDU3YjIxOGE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">If she pulled up, she'd fly right into his blade. If she didn't, she'd hit the ground hard enough to break bones. Either way, he had her.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYjExODgxODEyYTQ3N2JiZmU4M2Y4NjcxNTQ5MGEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo found himself moving before he'd consciously decided to act. His legs pumped across the muddy ground as he sprinted toward where Kaelan would impact. He couldn't reach her in time, couldn't do anything to help, but he ran anyway because standing still and watching felt like dying inside.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNDE2YmIxNzk1YTQ1ODBhNGQ4ZmQ4NmUyZTI4Yjg3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaelan twisted at the last moment, trying to angle her fall away from Sakurai's descending blade. It wasn't enough. The rapier scored along her ribs, parting leather and flesh with equal ease. She hit the ground hard, rolling to absorb the impact, but the wound was bleeding freely.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYTA5YTI3NTVmNTQyYjI4MzRlMDFlMjQ4N2VmOThi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Sakurai landed gracefully a few feet away, not even breathing hard. "Sloppy," he observed, advancing slowly. "You really have fallen far from what you once were."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYjg3MmIxNGQwNjQ5MWZiYTlmZmZlODA0YTA2NThi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaelan struggled to her feet, one hand pressed to her side. Her wings folded against her back and blood seeped between her fingers. "I'm what I choose to be," she said through gritted teeth. "Not what someone else made me."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZjM1YjdjYmU0NjRmNjViOTQ0Nzg0ZWZhMDJjMGUx"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Choice," Sakurai mused, twirling his rapier in a lazy figure-eight. "Such a mortal concept. As if wanting something badly enough could make it true." This time when he attacked, it was with lethal intent. No more games, no more showing off. The rapier flicked out in a series of quick thrusts, each one aimed at a vital point. Kaelan parried, her daggers ringing against his blade, but she was giving ground with each exchange.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOTg3NzM4ZGY1YjRlODVhZTkzZDU0MjQxMjYyMjUw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo was close enough now to see the sweat beading on her forehead, the slight tremor in her hands from blood loss and fatigue. She was losing. And there wasn't a damn thing he could do about it.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjczMTE5MGMyZTQwYjU5ZWU0ZTAzNmFiYmY5NzNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">He still had his sword. Still had his fire. Maybe he couldn't fly up and fight angels in aerial combat, but he was fast enough on the ground to reach them. All he had to do was time it right, wait for an opening, and-</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDViMmU4NzRjMDQyYmViNmZlM2RiNGExZjQ3NmFm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Sakurai's blade slipped past Kaelan's guard and punched through her shoulder. She gasped, staggering back, and Vertigo saw his chance. He lunged forward, massive sword raised in both hands, aiming for the ice angel's exposed back.</span></p><span class="cjY2NzkyZWM0YTg1NDQwYWE4Zjc4NTA5YWJlNjZlOWJk"><br/>This content has been unlawfully taken from Royal Road; report any instances of this story if found elsewhere.<br/></span>
<p class="cnMyZDBjNTliZGZjZTQ4NTE4ZjQ1ZmRhZjgxYTllZGVk"><span style="font-weight: 400">The blade never connected. Without even turning around, Sakurai gestured carelessly over his shoulder. Ice erupted from the ground in a thick wall, catching Vertigo's sword and stopping his charge cold. The impact jarred his arms so badly he nearly dropped his weapon. "Pathetic," Sakurai said, still focused on Kaelan. "Did you really think I wouldn't sense you coming?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OTljMjRlNzQ4MTRiY2Q5Njc0ODU4ODlmZDI2MGI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo tried to pull his sword free, but the ice held it fast. Worse, it was spreading up the blade toward the hilt, creeping toward his hands with obvious intent. He released the weapon and stepped back, watching frost crawl across the steel like some kind of infection.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhODg5OTMxYzcwMzRhZTg5MDY1NmRjY2RhZThlZjFi"><span style="font-weight: 400">"At least try to make this interesting," Sakurai continued, pressing his attack on Kaelan. "I'd hate for your final moments to be completely disappointing."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZjZhYzhkN2I3MDRjNmRhNDBmY2M0NTc1ZWU3YmFk"><span style="font-weight: 400">That was it. That was the moment something inside Vertigo finally snapped.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmODg1ODk3MDdlMDQyYzA4NGY2OTNiOWQ5OWI3MjVm"><span style="font-weight: 400">All his life he'd been the strong one, but now he was something else. A half-breed who wasn't quite human, wasn't quite demon, wasn't quite anything. Too dangerous for normal people, too weak for the real fighters. Always on the outside, always falling short, always watching others be what he could never become. And now Kaelan was going to die too, because he was exactly what Sakurai said he was. Pathetic. Useless. A disappointment. The rage that filled him then was unlike anything he'd ever experienced. Not the hot, quick anger that usually drove his fire magic, but something deeper and colder and infinitely more dangerous. It felt like falling into an abyss, like discovering that the ground beneath his feet had never been solid at all.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjVkN2U3YTk1MTQ5NzY5ZGY5ODJmMmVhMTY2NDgz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Pain exploded through his left shoulder blade like someone had driven a molten spike through bone. He gasped, staggering, but barely noticed the agony. All his attention was focused inward, on the thing that was awakening inside him. The thing that had always been there, waiting. The pain spread to his right shoulder, sharp and white-hot, like something was trying to tear its way out from the inside. He dropped to his knees in the mud, hunching over as another wave of agony crashed through him. Distantly, he could hear Kaelan and Sakurai still fighting, but their battle seemed to be happening in another world.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyODJjZGI5N2Q2NDRkMjZiOWZiMzU2MTY2MWFiYzg0"><span style="font-weight: 400">"What the fuck-" he started, then screamed as the pain peaked. Something was moving under his skin, pushing outward with irresistible force. There was a sound like canvas ripping, and something hot and wet spattered his face. Then, as suddenly as it had begun, the agony faded to a dull ache. Vertigo straightened slowly, trying to process what had just happened. Something was different. Something had changed about his body in a fundamental way that he could feel but not yet understand.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMWM1M2VmNGZkMDQ2ODQ5Zjc2NWU3NWYxNTdkYWMz"><span style="font-weight: 400">He looked over his shoulder and nearly passed out from shock.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDI1MWJmODk4MjRmNWI4MjYwNzEwNDM4MDlkYjhm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Wings. Massive, dragon-scaled wings in shades of crimson and gold sprouted from his shoulders. They weren't like Kaelan's bat wings or Sakurai's feathered appendages - these were something else entirely, something that belonged in legend rather than reality. Each scale caught what little light remained, creating patterns that seemed to shift and flow with his breathing.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhY2Y2MGQ2Yzk5ZTRiNGZiZmZmYzllZjhlMjExZGZl"><span style="font-weight: 400">The wings felt heavy, powerful, alien. Like wearing someone else's body parts. But they also felt </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">right</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> in a way that nothing else in his life ever had. As if this was what he'd been missing all along, the piece of himself that had always been absent.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDU5YjdlNWE0NDQzNjk5YTU1Y2JlYzRmMTE2ODY3"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Holy shit," he whispered, twisting to get a better look. The wings moved with his thoughts, responding to muscles he'd never known he possessed. When fully extended, they had to span at least twelve feet tip to tip. The membrane between the wing supports was tough but flexible, sensitive enough that he could feel air currents playing across the surface.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOGFiNjJhNzk0NTQwZDg4MzI3M2M0NzkwYzhkNGYx"><span style="font-weight: 400">The sound of combat nearby snapped him back to reality. Right. Flying angels. Aerial battle. Time to see if these things actually worked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTAwMDQ0M2NjNDQyYzg4ZGNhZDA0YjJkMzU2MDQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">He crouched, then launched himself into the air with all the force his enhanced physiology could provide. The wings caught the air instinctively, providing lift he hadn't expected. For a moment, he felt the incredible rush of actual flight - the ground falling away beneath him, the world opening up in three dimensions instead of two. Unfortunately, instinct and skill were two different things. Instead of graceful flight, he immediately tumbled back to earth, landing hard with a face full of mud.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZjhlYjM4ZmIzOTQxYjQ5NWE4NDRlZTQ2OGU0MDRl"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Son of a bitch," he muttered, spitting out dirt. Flying was harder than it looked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNDJjMTQ4MDlhNDRiMTZiZmJiMjYyOTgzZTI3ZjI0"><span style="font-weight: 400">The second attempt went better. He managed to stay airborne for almost ten seconds before a gust of wind sent him cartwheeling into a tree. The third try ended with him tangled in the mill's waterwheel, cursing creatively as he tried to extract himself from the wooden spokes. But the fourth attempt worked. Sort of. He flew like a drunken bat, all awkward flapping and uncontrolled lurching, but he was in the air and moving in roughly the direction he intended. That had to count for something.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZWM2OGNlYjJiMDQxYTJhMzYwNjlmN2FiZThhZTM1"><span style="font-weight: 400">The fight was still going on when he finally managed to rejoin it. Kaelan was on the defensive now, blood loss and fatigue taking their toll. Sakurai pressed his advantage relentlessly, his rapier weaving patterns of steel and ice that left Kaelan with fewer and fewer options. Vertigo barreled through the middle of their duel with all the grace of a cannonball. Someone yelped - he couldn't tell who - and then he was tumbling again, wings flailing as he tried to figure out which way was up. Three bodies tangled together in mid-air before separating in a chaotic explosion of feathers, membrane, and curses.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MGUyNjYwNGE4MDRiODM5MDNlMjEwNzA2YWY0NmIz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hands steadied him, helping him regain his balance in the air. Kaelan hovered beside him, her black wings keeping her effortlessly stable despite the wind. She released him once he seemed more or less stable, but not before he caught something in her silver eyes that might have been approval.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YWVkNjI0OGQxMTRhNDBiYTc4ZDI1ZDcwZWRjOTk0"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Of all the times for those to show up," she snapped, slightly out of breath. A new cut across her forehead was bleeding steadily. "Try not to get yourself killed."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZmUxMmYzYTJkNTQ5OWI5MmQ5NDFkNDc1ZDJlMjMx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she was gone again, darting at Sakurai like a bird of prey.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZjUzYWQzMzhmNzQyZjZhMDJmOTgzOThkOTQ0MmM1"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Ungrateful bitch," Vertigo muttered, but there was no real heat in it. He was here now, part of the fight instead of a helpless observer on the ground. That had to be worth something.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZTdlNzg5ZDM5YjRhNDk4OTBlNWI1M2JlYmRkYWFk"><span style="font-weight: 400">He followed her back into combat, flying like a freight train compared to her graceful precision but determined to make a difference. At least up here he had a better angle on Sakurai, could see the calculating coldness in those black eyes, the way he fought with clinical efficiency rather than passion. His sword was frozen to the ground somewhere below, but his fire would have to do. He tried to coordinate with Kaelan, force Sakurai to split his attention between multiple threats. It was a tactic that had worked countless times with Bliss and Nathan - overwhelm the enemy, don't let them focus on any single target.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmN2MzNDgzZDRjMzRhZDI4ZjM2ZTNiYmFjN2ViOTc3"><span style="font-weight: 400">The problem was, Kaelan fought like she was still alone. She ignored his attempts at coordination, sometimes getting in his way, and he nearly barbecued her by accident when she flew directly into his line of fire.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNmU3OTQxZGQ3ZDQ0MTE5NmQ0ZWVjMjY0OGY3YmZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Watch it!" she snarled, rolling away from his flames.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZDc0ZDc2NmI3MjQ1NzFhNTk5ZjM1YmUwMjgxM2I2"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Then work with me!" he shot back, trying to position himself for another attack. "Stop fighting like you're the only one here!"</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ODg5ZDhlMDQ4NjRlNWM5NTVmMTVhMDE0NDA4ODdi"><span style="font-weight: 400">She ignored him, which meant he had to dodge frantically when Sakurai launched a barrage of ice spears in their direction. His inexperienced flying made him clumsy and slow. One of the spears grazed his leg, leaving a line of frozen blood in its wake. The next exchange brought him face-to-face with Sakurai's outstretched hand, frost already gathering around the angel's fingertips as another spear began to form. At this range, with his pathetic flying skills, there was no way he could avoid it.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNTRkMjQ2OWFmZjQ3MDlhN2NhZGRjZjljNDMxYTYw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Something slammed into him from the side. Vertigo smelled ozone and lightning as electrical discharge washed over him, then he was falling, tumbling toward the ground like a stone. Kaelan had tackled him out of Sakurai's attack, taking them both out of the air to save his life. He hit the muddy ground hard enough to drive the air from his lungs. The ice spear buried itself in the earth beside him and shattered, spraying sharp fragments across his skin. Above him, Kaelan recovered her flight with enviable grace, her wings catching her before she could hit the ground.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYTJjNmQyZTFlYTQxNzg4NzM4OTA0ZjY5NDEyYjkz"><span style="font-weight: 400">She'd saved his life. At considerable risk to herself, with an enemy still airborne, she'd chosen to protect him rather than press her own attack.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzI0MzI5ZjNkNzQ0ZTU5ZWQ3Nzk1OGUxYWRhNTM2"><span style="font-weight: 400">"How touching," Sakurai's voice drifted down, filled with contempt and amusement. "Defending a half-breed. You really have fallen far, Kaelan."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYWJjNmJlZTAzODRkZmNiMjI1ZmU5ZTVlZmNmNjQ2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead of rising to the bait, Kaelan sheathed her daggers with deliberate precision. Vertigo watched her entire demeanor change, shifting from frantic combat readiness to something calmer, more controlled. When she spoke, her voice carried a cold certainty that made his skin crawl.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NjliMzc2YTZhNzQ2MGZhYjcyN2RmMThjZTllYzcx"><span style="font-weight: 400">"You never could beat me in a fair fight, Sakurai. That's why you had to rely on tricks and ambushes." She held out her hand, and power responded to her call. A staff materialized in her grasp - slightly taller than she was, made of some matte black material that seemed to swallow light. A golden crescent moon crowned the top, with a clear crystal nestled in its curve and a thin black ring floating around it like a fallen halo.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOTYzZTJhMzJlYTQ0OTJiNmI3ZmNjYzFiYjlkODZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">The weapon radiated authority, ancient power that made Vertigo's teeth ache just being near it. This wasn't just a tool - this was something fundamental, primal, like holding a piece of creation itself.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDk0MGQ0MTIwZDRhNzdiZmI0NjI4ZjY2NmM5YTIy"><span style="font-weight: 400">"You want to do this properly?" Kaelan asked, her voice carrying new weight. "Then let's do it properly."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMzk1ZTZhMmI0ODQ0YmJhNzU0YTRmOTFlNzE5ZDhh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Light began gathering at the staff's tip, growing into a sphere of brilliant energy that hurt to look at directly. The crystal pulsed in time with her heartbeat while the floating ring spun faster, creating a low hum that seemed to resonate in his bones.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDRiOGQ1NjNmMjQ2ZWE4MDI5MTFkZjUxZmI0ZGU2"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Last chance," she said quietly, pointing the glowing staff directly at Sakurai.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNzk1ZjJiZGU2YzRjMDdiZWEzZTc1MTQzYWU2ZjBm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Sakurai's laugh sounded like ice cracking. "You still don't understand. This isn't about what I want. This is about necessity. The greater good."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MjQyYmRiNGFiNDQxMDc5OWY4ZjhkNTgyNGNkZDBl"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Fuck the greater good," she replied, and unleashed hell.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMTI0ODk0YjhjNTRiNDRiNzFlOTUwNWYwYzNjMmNk"><span style="font-weight: 400">The blast that erupted from her staff was beyond anything Vertigo had ever witnessed. It wasn't just magical power - it was chaos given form, destruction wrapped in light, all the beautiful anarchy that made existence worth living. The beam streaked upward like a falling star in reverse, carrying promises of change and upheaval.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OWNlMmNmYWVlMTRiYzJiYjg3MjU1ZGZjNDdjNTFh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Sakurai barely managed to block it. Ice erupted around him in desperate barriers that only just contained the chaotic energy. When the light faded, his perfect composure was finally cracked, his immaculate clothes singed and torn. His counter-attack came immediately - guided ice spears that moved like heat-seeking missiles, followed by a wave of supercooled air that turned the rain to sleet.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Yzc1YzVhNjFkZjRkODFhYjVlZTEyMjY2YWFlOGRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaelan flipped mid-air to avoid the spears, her wings folding and extending with perfect timing. The spears passed beneath her harmlessly, but the cold air caught her, ice forming on her wings and weighing them down. Vertigo wanted to help, but his wings felt heavy and unresponsive after the crash landing. Still, he had to try. He couldn't lie here in the mud while she fought for both their lives.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmM2QxM2IzZjlkOTQ3MTNiYWZlYTMzZjU3YjZiNmFi"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Kae," Sakurai said softly, using what was clearly a pet name from their past. He slowed his attacks, almost as if he might stop fighting entirely.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YTJiYjdkMzIzNjQzOTZiNDA4MjRiYjZlZjlmZjE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a feint, psychological warfare. But for one fatal half-second, it worked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYTkxMGI5Y2U0YjQxZDY5M2JhMGE0ZmIwNmU5Mzk3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ice flowed from Sakurai's raised hand like something alive, coiling around Kaelan's legs and tightening. She tried to break free, silver eyes widening as she realized her mistake, but the magical bonds held firm against her struggles. Her lightning accomplished nothing against them but a snap of power.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZWQ3ZTNlOTg0NDRlMjY5MmIyM2ZmZTZjMmUwMTdl"><span style="font-weight: 400">"I'm stronger than you remember," Sakurai taunted, descending slowly as his ice spread up her body. "You can't dispel me so easily anymore."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZGY5ZjI3ZDE1NjQ4Mjk5OThiYTQzZDdmOGIwNTUy"><span style="font-weight: 400">The ice climbed toward her hips, glistening in the moonlight. This wasn't just restraint - it was execution, designed to rob her of mobility, then breathing, then life. She dropped out of the air before it could reach her wings, but the ice followed her down.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNDhjZDQ0ODBhMzQxN2Q5NzNjZWE5ZTE3MzY4NTZl"><span style="font-weight: 400">"I think you'll be coming home after all," Sakurai purred, his voice carrying intimacy that made Vertigo's skin crawl. There was something possessive in that tone, like this was about more than just following orders.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYzQ3NjViYTVhOTRlYmNiYTIxYzcwOGY3OWJjM2Iy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Rage exploded through Vertigo's chest like molten steel. This bastard had murdered Argent in cold blood, was now slowly killing Kaelan while taunting her with their shared history, and acted like it was all some kind of game. "Hey!" he shouted, climbing to his feet with his wings spread wide. "Why don't you pick on someone who can fight back?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNGM3NDJiYTZlOTRlZGFhNWE4MzA1OTI5NmNmODUy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Sakurai glanced down at him and laughed - actually laughed, like Vertigo was the most amusing thing he'd seen all day. "You think you're going to stop me, half-breed? You can barely fly, and your magic is barely more developed than a human's. What could you possibly do?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MGU1OTk5Nzc5NDRmYmM5ZjRlNWIwNmQ1Nzk4MDgz"><span style="font-weight: 400">The casual dismissal, the amused contempt, the reduction of everything he was to nothing more than an entertaining distraction - it all crystallized into white-hot fury that burned away every other consideration.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZTYxN2ZjMGNhYjQ2MDA5YThhODIyMzYwNmE4MGY1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Fine. If Sakurai wanted to see what a half-breed could do, Vertigo would show him.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NWY1NjgwZmZhYjQ0MDhhZTAwZDc4YTFmMTE4ZjYz"><span style="font-weight: 400">He didn't try to hold back the rage this time. He embraced it, let it fill him and burn away his doubts and limitations. "Yeah, I am going to stop you," he growled, retrieving his massive sword from where it had fallen. The ice around it shattered at his touch, unable to withstand the heat now radiating from his skin. "And I'm going to enjoy every fucking second of it." The weapon felt different now - balanced perfectly by his new wings, an extension of his enhanced physiology rather than an unwieldy burden.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZDRmYzJmOWZkNTQ3YmFhZTQwOWQzZDhkNzcxYTc5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Sakurai's pale wings flattened against his back as he turned away from the ice-bound Kaelan. "Very well. If you insist on dying first, I'm happy to accommodate you."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOWY0OGI2OWRmMDRjZjZiNTliNmQwZDA0ZTQyNGIz"><span style="font-weight: 400">The angel moved like liquid death, his rapier seeking gaps in Vertigo's defense with surgical precision. They were suddenly locked in combat that Vertigo knew he was outmatched in. Sakurai had centuries of experience against his handful of years, speed that matched or exceeded Kaelan's, and the kind of cold tactical mind that calculated three moves ahead.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMTNjNmExM2RiMDQ4YmM4ZWQyNTY4OGFmYjA0MzFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">If Vertigo could land one solid hit, his superior strength might turn the tide. The problem was surviving long enough to create that opportunity. With both hands on his sword, he couldn't throw fire, and dropping his guard would be suicide against an opponent of this caliber. Sakurai fought with lazy confidence, seeming to put no effort into his attacks or dodges as Vertigo parried desperately.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYTgwMGE0NmI1ODQ2NTlhMGI0NTk1NDUyNWM0OGIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Behind the ice angel, Kaelan hunched over on the ground, fighting for breath as frost encased her ribcage. Her struggles were growing weaker. She was running out of time, and he was no closer to victory.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzODQwNGExOTc5NzQ5NWNiMGQ0ZjlhNmMwYTIwZTRi"><span style="font-weight: 400">"You've been entertaining," Sakurai said conversationally, not even breathing hard. "But it's time to finish this. Time to complete what she apparently couldn't." Frost crystallized around his free hand's fingertips - another ice spear forming. Vertigo had no shield, nowhere to run, and wasn't sure his fire could stop a direct magical attack.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMjRmMTAzYjU1NTQzOGY5ZmY4MTQwMGEyODk3MDgy"><span style="font-weight: 400">But he had one last desperate option.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMGI5MDQ2YTk5NDRlYmNhMDM1N2ZiZTIxMzlhNWJj"><span style="font-weight: 400">He let his mind go blank and focused on the one person who had never failed him, who always came through when everything else fell apart. He wasn't sure if he could send a message over such distance, but it was all he had left.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlODM0Y2NkMDcyNTQ0MWZhODNmZWRlNTJjMGRiNzQ0"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">::COMMANDER!::</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNkOWI1MmI1YjVjMzRkZTI4N2ZlMWQ2ODk5YmMxYTA1"><span style="font-weight: 400">The mental shout carried all his desperation and need across whatever miles separated them. For a moment, nothing happened. Sakurai's ice spear continued forming, its crystalline point aimed at Vertigo's heart.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZmJiOTZjYTNjZDQxZjk4MWE4Mjg4N2ViOWY4OTMy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then there was a whoosh of displaced air and a spray of blood as wings burst into existence with violent force.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMzkzZDNmZWZiMzQ0NDU4MDQ1NjRkNjFlNzZkODQw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Commander stood between them, his mismatched wings - one black as midnight, one gold as dawn - spread wide behind him. Gore splattered his face and hands from his sudden manifestation, but his eyes were cold and calculating as winter stars.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZmIyODcxZmJkZjQ1ODY4ZjU4ZjUwNTAzNmZlY2Yy"><span style="font-weight: 400">He grinned at Sakurai, feral and terrifying. "Hi. Can I play?"</span></p>
