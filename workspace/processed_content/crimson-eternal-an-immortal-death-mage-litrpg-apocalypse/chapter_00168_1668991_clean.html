    There are quite a few updates to this glossary. For one, I added the descriptions for four different nations. Arian, the Frost Clan, the Rex Dynasty of the Dead, and the Shengshi Dynasty. And for two, I added a few characters to the glossary and altered a few details about some of the other nations to compensate for the time that's passed. Albeit not many details.
