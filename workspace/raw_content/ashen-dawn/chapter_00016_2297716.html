<p class="cnM2NzNlY2RiZDdlNjQzYmM4MDVhMjBhNWVjYWUyNmJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dusk had fallen by the time Kaelan, Argent, and Vertigo stood in the alley across from the tavern. The Crimson Raven was exactly the sort of establishment that catered to those who preferred their business transactions unobserved by authority figures. Light spilled from grimy windows onto cobblestone streets slick with the day's earlier rain, accompanied by the din of raucous laughter and off-key singing that suggested the night's drinking had already begun in earnest. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">The building itself looked like it had been cobbled together from the ruins of three different structures, with mismatched stonework and a roof that sagged ominously in the middle. A weathered sign swung from rusted chains above the entrance, its painted raven so faded it looked more like a poorly executed chicken. The kind of place where questions weren't asked and answers weren't volunteered.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTE0YzVlMDQ3MjQxMGU5ZjViNzQ2MTA0MTU1YWRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">"I count at least twelve armed men from here," Kaelan murmured, scanning the patrons visible through the windows. She'd already used a simple glamour to darken her hair to midnight black and traded her usual hunting leathers for simple but well-made traveling clothes. The transformation was subtle but effective; where before she'd looked like someone who could handle herself in a fight, now she appeared to be exactly what their cover story claimed. "Right. We're merchant's daughters fallen on hard times, looking for some black market opportunities." She adjusted her shirt's neckline with practiced efficiency. "Any tactical insights before we walk into this place?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNiN2IxZmNjNjJmNDRmYjc5N2E2ZGQ5MGYyYzlkZGFm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo leaned against the alley wall, arms crossed over his chest. His massive sword was concealed beneath a long coat that had seen better decades, and a worn leather hat cast shadows over his face. "Don't get clever. These types think they're smarter than they are, let them. And if you see a pale redhead who looks like she costs more than this entire district, that's Dominique. Stay away from her and signal me immediately."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NjNjNTI2MjA2ZjQyZmE5ZjU5YzA2YzNkMmUyNTRl"><span style="font-weight: 400">He pulled out a small leather pouch, dividing coins between them and giving Argent the larger share. The gesture wasn't lost on Kaelan; he understood that nervous people spent money more freely, and Argent's obvious anxiety would sell their cover better than any acting. "Find the loudest, most obnoxious assholes in there and get them whatever they want. They'll talk. They always do, especially the low-level idiots who think a couple of pretty faces won't matter." His gaze settled on Argent, who was fidgeting with her cloak despite her efforts to appear calm. "Think you can sit quietly and let them run their mouths without looking like you're about to panic?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNWI3N2MzNDg4MTRiMTQ5NjgwOWFkODAzZmFkZjBh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Argent squared her shoulders, though her fingers still worried the edge of her cloak. The nervous energy was real enough; she'd been jumpy since they'd entered Etienne, constantly scanning for threats that might or might not exist. But it would work in their favor tonight. "I can handle it."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZDY1ZDZlYjc0YjRjODE4M2E4YzhkMWEwMzIyNDg1"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Good." Vertigo stepped back into the shadows where he could observe the entrance while remaining hidden. The positioning was tactical; close enough to intervene quickly, far enough back to avoid being associated with them if things went sideways. "Don't push for information. Just be the helpless things they expect and let them impress you with how important they are. Men like this can't resist showing off for a pretty audience."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZDQzNzAzYWIwODQzMzlhNWE4ZTBmMzhlY2I3Nzll"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaelan shot him a withering look. "I know how to hunt, asshole." Without waiting for his response she deliberately undid the top button of her shirt, displaying a generous amount of cleavage, and strode toward the tavern.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNDUzZGU5ZTlmNDRmNzY4NDYyYWE3ZjE0OWY5ODlk"><span style="font-weight: 400">The bouncer at the door was exactly what she'd expected; burly, bored, and carrying enough concealed steel to outfit a small squad. A professional, then, not just some drunk they'd hired to look intimidating. His eyes tracked over them with the lazy assessment of someone paid to notice trouble, taking in everything from their clothing to their posture to the way they moved. She could practically see him cataloging potential threat levels. "Evening, ladies. New faces."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZTcwNzkyYjNmOTQyM2JiZjc3NmVhYWIyM2U1NDQ4"><span style="font-weight: 400">The words were casual enough, but there was a question buried in the observation. Kaelan let herself deflate slightly, shoulders slumping in a way that suggested defeat rather than confidence. "New in town," she replied, letting desperation color her voice. "Someone said this might be a place to make... connections." She flashed Commander's token with deliberate clumsiness, like someone trying to be subtle and failing.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZDUyOTgwMzkxZDQ1YjZhOTBjMmFjM2I0YzY4M2Yw"><span style="font-weight: 400">The bouncer's attention sharpened at the sight of the token, and she saw recognition flicker across his features. He studied them for a moment longer, his gaze lingering on Argent's pale, nervous face and the way she kept glancing around as though expecting attack. Finally he stepped aside, but not before making his own assessment clear. "Keep it civilized."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MWI1MzlkNjEyNDQ0ZTY5NDM1Y2QxZmRiZGUzZjdm"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Crimson Raven's interior hit them like a physical assault. Heat, noise, and the reek of cheap alcohol, unwashed bodies, and something charred from the kitchen created a miasma that made Kaelan's eyes water. The place was built for maybe fifty people but currently held twice that, bodies packed around rough wooden tables and spilling into every available space. Smoke from poorly maintained oil lamps mixed with tobacco and less identifiable substances, creating a haze that hung just below the ceiling like a noxious cloud. Servers wove through the crush with practiced efficiency, balancing trays of foaming ale and cloudy spirits while avoiding the wandering hands of drunk patrons.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNGNlY2I4OWYxYjQ4MmRhNzIzNWE1NjQ4YTVkOGRj"><span style="font-weight: 400">She swept the room with predatory efficiency, cataloging exits and threats while maintaining the appearance of nervous uncertainty. A door behind the bar led to storage or kitchens, a potential escape route or potential trap, depending on what lay beyond. Another exit was partially hidden behind a beaded curtain at the far end, probably leading to private rooms where the real business was conducted. Windows could serve in a pinch, though they looked like they hadn't been cleaned since the Apocalypse and were probably painted shut besides.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YTFjN2YwZDIwZjQ3Y2ViMDA2MjA4MTRjYzEzYmE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">The patrons ranged from working folk trying to forget their problems to harder types with the unmistakable bearing of professional violence. She could spot the mercenaries easily enough; better weapons, better posture, eyes that never stopped moving. The kind of men who made their living in places where civilization was more suggestion than reality. The group Vertigo had described wasn't hard to spot. While most of the tavern's clientele wore the functional clothing of laborers or the practical gear of traveling fighters, this crew lounged in the corner wearing finer fabrics and better boots. Their casual sprawl across the benches spoke of men accustomed to being catered to, and the way other patrons gave them space suggested a reputation for nastiness. More importantly, they were loud, drunk, and clearly felt safe enough to run their mouths without consequences.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYWY4YTUxOTI4NTQ1ZmNhZmY5NmFiMGUzZWY0NjVk"><span style="font-weight: 400">No redhead, thankfully. Dominique's absence was one less complication to manage.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NmJjZWRkOThlNjQ0YTU4MzgzNGZlYjQwMzcyZmU0"><span style="font-weight: 400">"See our marks?" Kaelan murmured to Argent, pitching her voice just loud enough to be heard over the tavern's din.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NzhiNGFjOGYyMjQzNjM5YTRlMTkyYmJiZmFmNGRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">"The overdressed ones in the corner?" Argent's reply was barely audible, but her eyes had found the target table.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMzFiZWYzMTFkZjQyMDE4Nzg4NTViM2ExN2M3YWU0"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Exactly." Kaelan let her lips curve into a predatory smile that she quickly suppressed. No point in breaking character before they'd even made contact. "Rememberâ€¦ we're not threats. We're opportunities waiting to be exploited."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZjRlMjU3Zjc3MDRmMjdhZjk1MzdmMTg2MDZjMWQx"><span style="font-weight: 400">The approach required delicate timing. Too eager and they'd seem suspicious; too reluctant and they'd miss the opening entirely. She waited until one of the men at the target table gestured broadly while making some point, spilling ale across the wooden surface, before making her move. She approached with calculated grace, allowing her body language to project just the right mix of confidence and vulnerability. The conversation at the corner table was already loud enough to carry across half the tavern, dominated by complaints about the town, the locals, and the general quality of everything they'd encountered. Outsiders, then, which fit perfectly with what they needed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYTY4MDY2YWIxYzQ3MjRhOTU1YjgzNTAxZTljZmJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Room for a couple more?" Kaelan asked, flashing her most disarming smile at the apparent leader of the group. "My sister and I heard this might be a place where enterprising ladies could find... opportunities."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOGFhZjVlYTI0YTRkZmU5MjYxOTc5NTU0NmEzYjNk"><span style="font-weight: 400">The men exchanged glances, their assessment obvious and thoroughly unpleasant. She could practically feel them cataloging everything from her appearance to her apparent desperation level, calculating what they might be able to extract in exchange for whatever scraps of opportunity they might throw her way. After a moment the leader, a soft-faced man with rings on every finger and the pallor of someone who spent most of his time indoors, gestured magnanimously. "Always room for pretty company," he declared, the words slightly slurred but his eyes sharp enough. "What sort of opportunities might you be seeking?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NTZlYzNlODFlOTQxZGZiODVjMjQzNWY2NGUyMzA2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaelan slid onto the bench beside him, making sure to brush against his arm as she settled. Argent took a seat next to a younger man who seemed marginally less intoxicated than his companions, her nervous energy perfectly suited to playing the intimidated younger sister. "The profitable kind," Kaelan replied with conspiratorial warmth, leaning in just enough to suggest intimacy while keeping her voice low enough that the surrounding tables couldn't overhear. "Our father's shipping business went under last month. Apparently when half your crew is skimming profits, the other half stops working." She gave a delicate shrug that made the men's eyes track predictably downward. "We've got skills but not much else left."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMWJlNmNiYTY3YTQyNDc5ZjhlMmVlMzRiNTJkMWVk"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Skills?" One of the others leaned forward, breath reeking of cheap wine and rotting teeth. "What sort of skills?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNWU2ZGRlZTQ0NDRhZTg5MmI0YTdhNGVlY2UwZTc1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Perfect opening. Kaelan let her smile turn mysterious while projecting just enough vulnerability to keep them interested. "The useful kind. We're quick learners, we don't ask inconvenient questions, and we're very good at looking like we belong wherever we need to be."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYzM3ZjAzYzc1YjQ0N2NiYWM3NjMxNDdjNGM2N2Nh"><span style="font-weight: 400">The men laughed with the particular smugness of idiots who thought they'd found easy marks. Their body language shifted, becoming more relaxed and predatory at the same time, the attitude of hunters who'd spotted wounded prey. The conversation that followed confirmed they were outsiders, mercenaries most likely, based on their casual references to travel and their obvious discomfort with the local atmosphere.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1N2Y1NzBhYTZiYjQ0MmU5MTBkNDM1NWZhNWFhOGNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">One of them was already signaling for more drinks, the universal sign that they intended to get their new companions drunk enough to become pliable. Kaelan accepted the offered ale while making mental notes about each man at the table: who seemed to be in charge, who was more drunk than the others, who might be persuaded to talk if approached correctly. She nursed the drink they'd pushed at her while making deprecating comments about the town's lack of prospects. Each remark was carefully calculated to present her as desperate enough to be useful but still maintaining enough pride to be worth corrupting - â€”the kind of woman who might be convinced to compromise her principles if the price was right.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMDhlMGZiY2Y2ZjRhYTQ4ZjBiMDUyOWE4OTA5YTIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">"It's not just the mud and the smell," she sighed, taking the smallest possible sip of whatever rotgut they'd given her. The stuff tasted like it could strip paint. "There's just nothing here worth pursuing. No opportunities, no connections, no future."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwY2IzZGMwZmE1NjQwZTQ4YjI4NmIxYjRmYzM0MTFi"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Sounds like half the losers in this place," one of them laughed, the comment carrying just enough edge to suggest he didn't consider himself part of that category. "Pretty thing like you shouldn't be stuck in a shithole like this."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNjU3MGI0OGI2MzQ1ZTg5Yzc5NTg0Yzc2NTUyYmNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">His companion, slightly more sober than the rest, added with a meaningful look that made her skin crawl: "Should've seen us earlier. We'd have found something for you to do."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NTY2ZTQ3OTAwMDQwMGJiYWUwYjNhNTEyNTRmMzY2"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Earlier where?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Kaelan filed the comment away while laughing as though flattered by the attention. "I'm sure you gentlemen keep yourselves busy. What sort of work brings you through such a... charming place?" The question was carefully neutral, just curious enough to seem natural without being obvious fishing for information. She watched their reactions carefully; who tensed up, who seemed eager to boast, who might be drunk enough to let something slip.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNjA2OGIxOGJmMjQ5ZmNhNDYxN2ZlM2MzZjYyOTNm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Before anyone could answer, another man, drunker than the rest, suggested with a leer that made her want to break his fingers: "Maybe we should take you south with us when we head out. Give you a chance to see some real opportunities."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MGI0NGEzZmZlYzQ3MDhiZGNmYzE5Zjc5YzI4MzVm"><span style="font-weight: 400">The comment earned sharp looks from his companions, and one elbowed him hard enough to slosh his drink across the table. "Shut up, you idiot." But the damage was done. Now she knew they were planning to travel south, probably soon, and that they were recruiting for something that required discretion. The pieces were starting to fall into place.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OTAzNTk4OGZhYzQwY2Y4YjI2NDJkNzM1YjI1Y2Fh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, Argent had managed to draw the younger man into quieter conversation, her nervous demeanor apparently triggering his protective instincts. Kaelan couldn't catch all their words over the tavern's noise, but she could see his body language relaxing as Argent played up her vulnerable act with subtle skill. "Traveling sounds exciting," Argent was saying, wide-eyed and innocent. "Is it dangerous? I've heard stories about bandits and worse things in the wilderness..."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MDE0Y2U5ZWQzMzQyMmRhY2I4NDI1ZjQyNzFhOTBk"><span style="font-weight: 400">The young man glanced around nervously before leaning closer, clearly torn between the desire to impress her and the knowledge that he probably shouldn't be talking about certain subjects. "Not bandits you need to worry about around here. It's the... other things. Since that woman showed up, people have been disappearing. Good people, not just street trash."</span></p><span class="cjMwZjA2MmY4NTVmNzQ2ZGZiMzg4OWVjNzVhZDlmMjVi"><br/>Stolen content warning: this content belongs on Royal Road. Report any occurrences.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNkN2FlYWE2NmNmNTQ3MjQ4ZjI1ZDM1NWNhMTlhYjkx"><span style="font-weight: 400">"What woman?" Argent's voice carried just the right note of breathless concern, as though she were hanging on his every word.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkY2IxMTc4MmM3NTQ3YjQ4YzQ5Y2EyNmVmMmZiN2Nj"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Redhead. Beautiful but... wrong, you know? Cold as winter ice and twice as dangerous." He took a nervous gulp of his ale, the liquid sloshing as his hands trembled slightly. "Came through a few days ago with a crew of professionals. Real professionals, not like these local idiots. Since then, folks have been vanishing. The kind who'd fight back if they saw trouble coming."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MzJlZTY5ZTVjNjQyNzhiM2NhOWYyYzQ3YzQ0MWE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaelan felt a cold chill that had nothing to do with the tavern's drafts. Dominique had been here recently, and if people were disappearing then they were running exactly the kind of operation she'd suspected. Her attention snapped back to her own conversation as one of the men moved closer, his hand landing on her thigh under the table with the casual assumption of someone who'd never been told no by a woman who mattered. "Forget about heading south," he slurred, fingers creeping higher with drunken boldness. "I'll show you some real opportunities right here. Tonight, even."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDUwYTZmNGUzZDQ1MDdiYzQ5MzkxOTNmNTkxYmYz"><span style="font-weight: 400">She maintained her smile through pure force of will, every instinct screaming to break his wrist and use the sharp pieces to redecorate the tavern walls. Instead she gracefully extracted herself, rising with a practiced laugh that suggested flattery rather than revulsion. "Let me get everyone another round first. I believe in proper hospitality before... business discussions."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZTYzMDNlZTBlMDRhNGM4ZWVjMDJlMjI1Y2YyMTFi"><span style="font-weight: 400">The comment earned appreciative chuckles from the men, who clearly interpreted it as agreement to whatever they had in mind. At the bar, she positioned herself next to the third man from their table, who was waiting for service with the careful attention of someone trying not to look as drunk as he actually was. He was warier than his companions but didn't object when she offered to buy drinks for the entire group, apparently interpreting the gesture as proof of her desperation to ingratiate herself.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNDJlOWRkNGE0ZDQ3OWI5NmVlYWE5ODM3YzIxNTM1"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Generous of you," he commented, eyeing her with slightly more focus than she was comfortable with. "Most people in your situation would be counting every copper."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZmI2N2Q0YzZmNjQzOWE5YzBlNzVlMDJkYTAyYjk0"><span style="font-weight: 400">The observation was pointed enough to suggest he wasn't as drunk as he appeared. She filed that away for future reference while maintaining her cover. "Investment in future opportunities," she replied with what she hoped was the right blend of optimism and desperation. "Sometimes you have to spend money to make money."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZDJjOTA0ODcwYjQ3NWM5ZmQ3MzI2ZjdlMjdjMzEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">As she waited for the bartender to prepare their order, she noticed Argent's subtle glances toward two newcomers who had just entered. They were dressed differently from their current marks; heavier leather, better weapons, the bearing of professionals rather than hired muscle. More importantly, they moved to the bar but kept casting meaningful looks at the corner table where she'd been sitting.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMmEzYTZjYmY3NDQ1ZTI4ZjI1Njg3NjM5MjAyNzdj"><span style="font-weight: 400">The dynamics were shifting, and not in their favor. Whatever window of opportunity they'd been operating in was closing fast.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NDFlYTIxMTIxYTQ3NDFhNDE1NTFlZTFmY2NjMjgx"><span style="font-weight: 400">When she returned with a serving girl carrying fresh drinks, the atmosphere had changed dramatically. The men were still loud and crude, but there was an undercurrent of tension that hadn't been there before. The newcomers had positioned themselves with clear sightlines to their table, and one kept his hand suspiciously close to a concealed weapon. Professional paranoia, the kind that came from working in environments where threats could emerge without warning.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDZkNTYxODczMDRhMjQ5NTk0NWFhZjA3ZGNlOTQ0"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Drink up, ladies," the leader declared, pushing fresh shots toward them with more force than necessary. "Can't do business with people who won't share a toast."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YTk1ZTk1MzM3MjRmYWRiOTU3NDYyOTcyMmQ0YTA5"><span style="font-weight: 400">The statement carried weight beyond its surface meaning. This wasn't just social drinking anymore: it was a test, and failure would have consequences they probably wouldn't enjoy. Trapped by her cover and the need to maintain rapport, Kaelan found herself accepting drink after drink. The harsh liquor burned down her throat like liquid fire, and she began to feel the first troubling tingles of electricity building under her skin. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5N2Y5M2Y5M2ZkYTQzNTViMWU3MDljMjRhYTEwNjQw"><span style="font-weight: 400">It started as a barely perceptible warmth, a tingling in her fingertips that could have been attributed to nerves or circulation. But she knew better. The electrical charge was building, seeking outlets, growing stronger with each shot they pressed on her. Small sparks began dancing between her fingers under the table, invisible to the men around her but unmistakable to anyone who knew what to look for. She clenched her hands into fists, fighting to contain the growing charge, but already she could feel her control slipping. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4NzQ3OGRlNTMzNDRlZWNiOTM1M2Q1NzA3OWU0NWI3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Across from her, Argent noticed immediately. With remarkable presence of mind, the younger angel shifted position, pressing her foot against Kaelan's boot under the table. Instantly she began channeling away some of the overflow, using her storm affinity to ground the excess energy through subtle contact. But even with Argent's help, the situation was deteriorating rapidly.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOWRjMzQ5ZDRiOTRkOTRiYzViYjg2MWE0MDhiYzYy"><span style="font-weight: 400">The two newcomers were moving closer now, their interest no longer casual observation. One leaned down to whisper in the leader's ear, and whatever he said made the man's expression sharpen instantly, all pretense of drunken friendliness evaporating. "That so?" the leader asked, suddenly much more alert despite his apparent intoxication. His eyes fixed on Kaelan with new intensity, cataloging details he'd missed before.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNmQ5MWE2ZWNkZDQwMzdhNTA2YWQ0YWU0MDQ3NWEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">The newcomer nodded once, his gaze shifting to Kaelan with cold assessment. "Boss wants a word."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMWYzZmQ5NjY1MjRhOTc4MTBjYTZmZGUwNzVkOTZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">The entire table's mood shifted like a storm front passing overhead. The jovial drunkenness evaporated, replaced by predatory focus that made the air feel electric even without her growing power problem. Kaelan felt the change keenly, even through the growing haze affecting her senses. The electrical charge was building to dangerous levels, seeking any outlet it could find. A small blue arc of lightning jumped from her fingers to a man's belt buckle, the metal conducting the charge with a sharp snap that made him yelp and jerk in his seat.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMzQ2OGYwYzc3NDQzMTJiZGRhYzQxOTZiZDU3NzA0"><span style="font-weight: 400">"What the hellâ€¦"</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ODQ4YjdjN2MxMjQxY2E4NjEwNmJjNmFhYzdjOTE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Sorry," Kaelan said quickly, tucking her hands under the table while fighting to maintain her composure. "Just some static."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Y2NjYWFkMWY4NzQ2NzRhM2E5ZWFmYjRlZTY1NDcx"><span style="font-weight: 400">But the damage was done. The newcomers exchanged knowing glances, their suspicions confirmed by the small display of uncontrolled power. "Lightning affinity," one observed quietly, his voice carrying the matter-of-fact tone of someone identifying a useful tool. "She's a Talent."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MmEyMGEzZDA0NTRkZDE5OGFlZWMxYjY2MmY3MmM4"><span style="font-weight: 400">The leader's face hardened, all traces of earlier friendliness disappearing as he reassessed the situation. "You should've mentioned that detail earlier, sweetheart." His hand moved to his hip, where she could now see the outline of a weapon worn with the familiarity of frequent use.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZjc4NjA0NWRlOTQzODJhYTQwYmQxMGVhMGM0MTE0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaelan's vision was starting to blur at the edges, the room tilting slightly as the alcohol fully hit her system. Each heartbeat sent another pulse of electricity through her body, and she could feel her control fracturing like ice under pressure. The power wanted out, demanded release, and her ability to contain it was failing with each passing second. "Time to go," she murmured to Argent, fighting to keep her voice steady while electrical current danced beneath her skin.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTJmM2MyYjkzNzQ1NjBhNDY5YzlkOWYwODhkNWYz"><span style="font-weight: 400">"I think the ladies were just leaving," one of the men said, his tone making it clear this wasn't a suggestion. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyYzQ1NDkyOGZkMzQ2ZjM4NjM3ZTY0YWM2MTk4MzQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">The larger newcomer stepped forward, blocking their path to the door with professional efficiency. "Not just yet. Haven't seen you two around before tonight. Curious what your business might really be."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNTVlMDIzYzNiMDQyNjZhYjU3ZWUxOTgxMTI0ZDdk"><span style="font-weight: 400">"We were just making conversation," Argent said softly. "We didn't mean any offense."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTJiNzgxNDk5MzQwMmZhZDRkYzc0NjE4OTdhM2Q0"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Funny how your conversation keeps touching on our business," the man replied, his eyes never leaving Kaelan's face. "Boss doesn't like curiosity. Especially from Talents who forget to mention what they are."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NGI5MDZjNzdiNzQ3MWE4MTRlNmUwMWI0ZTMwM2Q3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Before Kaelan could respond, the drunk who'd been pawing at her earlier lurched to his feet, swaying dangerously as alcohol and indignation warred for control of his motor functions. "Hey!" he slurred, poking a finger into the newcomer's chest with more enthusiasm than sense. "We was talking to the pretty ladies first. You can wait your damn turn."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNjYyM2QwYmRlNjRmNDA4ZjJjNzNjYjU2NjFjZWZh"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Sit down, you idiot," his companion hissed, trying to pull him back before he could make the situation worse.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1M2M4ZDVlZDg2NDQ3ODc4YzgxZWQ1MzJmZjM2NTA5"><span style="font-weight: 400">But the drunk was beyond reason, shoving the larger man with more enthusiasm than effectiveness. "I said back off!"</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ODUzODZjYzdkNDRmY2JhODI0YjZmY2FkOTgxYmQ4"><span style="font-weight: 400">The newcomer's response was swift and brutal. His fist connected with the drunk's jaw, sending him sprawling across the table in a shower of glass and spilled liquor. His companions jumped up with angry shouts, and chaos erupted as the brawl spread to neighboring tables with the infectious speed of tavern violence. Kaelan seized the moment. "Now," she whispered to Argent, grabbing her wrist with fingers that crackled with barely contained energy.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYWI0NjNkZjk1NzQ4MWQ4MGJiNTA4YWRjYmVjNzU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">They slipped away from the table as the fight expanded, drawing in bystanders with remarkable speed. Bar fights had their own momentum, pulling in anyone unfortunate enough to be within range when fists started flying. But the second newcomer anticipated their move, appearing at Kaelan's side with professional efficiency that suggested extensive experience in crowd control. "Not so fast," he said, reaching for her arm with confident authority.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYWJjYjc5N2JmYjQ4OGNiODc0NDEwNjBjY2VhZjg2"><span style="font-weight: 400">The instant his fingers touched her skin, a massive discharge of electrical energy erupted outward like a lightning strike in miniature. Blue-white light flared as the man was thrown backward, crashing into a table with a scream of pain and surprise. The smell of ozone and burned hair filled the air, cutting through the tavern's usual reek of alcohol and unwashed humanity.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZjY3YmQ3NTA5MzRkYzM4YTY2OTNjMmU1ODVlMGYy"><span style="font-weight: 400">The entire tavern froze for a heartbeat, all eyes turning to Kaelan as the reality of what they'd just witnessed sank in. Even in the dim light, the crackling energy surrounding her was impossible to miss now, small arcs of lightning dancing visibly between her fingers and along her hair like captive storms.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YmQwYmFkM2ZjYjRhNmJiZWMzNDkxMDVjYmY5NjNk"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Talent!" someone shouted, and the stillness shattered into panicked motion. "Rogue Talent!"</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNWMzODRmNGQyNzQ5YjBiNTQwMmZmYTMzZjY1NGZm"><span style="font-weight: 400">The tavern erupted into true chaos, patrons scrambling for exits, others drawing weapons, the bartender diving for cover behind his bar with the practiced efficiency of someone who'd dealt with magical incidents before. They thought she was just another half-breed losing control, the very thing she'd spent centuries hunting down and eliminating. The irony would have been amusing if it weren't potentially fatal.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNWYxYzI1N2EyYzQ4NzA4ZTEzZmJkYmI5Yzc3MDI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Argent seized Kaelan's sleeve with a cloth-wrapped hand, pulling her toward a side exit as more electrical discharges sparked from her body, eliciting screams and curses from anyone unlucky enough to be nearby. "We need to leave," Argent urged, her voice steady despite the mayhem surrounding them.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhM2Y3OTJiMzBlMDRjOTZiY2MzMjBkOTkxMzg1ODJh"><span style="font-weight: 400">They burst through the side door into a narrow alley, the cool night air providing momentary relief against Kaelan's fevered skin. But the respite was brief. Angry voices and pounding footsteps echoed behind them, their pursuers not far behind and growing more numerous by the second.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OTU2M2FlYjM1ZjQzMTZhMjk0NGJlNjY4MzdiM2E2"><span style="font-weight: 400">"This way," Argent said, tugging Kaelan deeper into the shadows between buildings. After only a few steps, Kaelan stumbled as another violent surge forced her to her knees. The cobblestones beneath her hands cracked with the discharge, blue light strobing through the alley like trapped lightning. Power that should have been hers to command was running wild, seeking any outlet it could find.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MmQyZWEwOGM2YTRjMTc5MDBlMzYwN2MwODc4YjEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Can't..." she gasped, fighting to contain the power threatening to explode outward in an uncontrolled burst that could level half the district. "Go. Get Vertigo. I'llâ€¦"</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YmY4ZjhhMzcyYzQ0NWM5OTIxNjk5OWY2MzczMWYw"><span style="font-weight: 400">"I'm not leaving you," Argent cut her off, though her voice trembled with the strain of absorbing Kaelan's overflow. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZDUxNDQzZjhmZDRkZDA5ODBjOTdjZDZkNjQ2YzFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">The pursuing footsteps grew louder, closer. Multiple sets now, the tavern's security, probably, along with whoever else had been unlucky enough to get caught up in the chaos. Kaelan tried to rise but another wave of dizziness sent her back down, her body's normal balance completely disrupted. The electrical discharge was growing stronger, more chaotic with each passing second. Small metal objects in the alley - nails, coins, bits of scrap - flew toward her, drawn by the powerful electromagnetic field building around her body. If she lost control completely here, in this confined space...</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNGEwM2VmYTA0ZDQ5NjVhZTBlNDI3OGQ1YTFhN2I1"><span style="font-weight: 400">A dark figure materialized at the alley's mouth, massive sword gleaming in the sporadic light of her unstable power. Relief flooded through her as she recognized the familiar silhouette.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZWQ2YTMwNDFjYjQ1YmM4MjI1Njk0MWRlN2U4NGE3"><span style="font-weight: 400">"About damn time," Vertigo growled, taking in the situation at a glance. Without hesitation he charged past them, meeting their pursuers head-on in a clash of steel that echoed off the alley walls. "Get her out of here," he ordered Argent. "I'll handle these assholes."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZGE5NGNmZTM0MTQzZGU5ODQzOTY2MzkxM2E5OWE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Argent nodded, struggling to support Kaelan's increasingly unsteady form as they staggered deeper into the maze of alleys that connected Etienne's older districts. The sounds of combat faded behind them, replaced by the electric crackle of Kaelan's destabilizing power and the distant shouts of more pursuers organizing a search.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZTRhNDM0NGM0NDQzZDhhMWQwOGY4YjZjMDdlMzMx"><span style="font-weight: 400">She fought to focus through the haze of alcohol and magical overload. Her skin felt too tight, electricity seeking any outlet it could find while her normal control mechanisms failed one by one. The reflection in a shop window showed hair bleached back to silver, eyes glowing with unnatural light, energy visibly dancing across her skin like captive lightning. The bitter irony wasn't lost on her, even through the alcoholic fog. Here she was, exactly what she'd accused the half-breed of being: an out-of-control Talent, dangerous to everyone around her. The perfect hunter, reduced to the very thing she'd spent centuries eliminating.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MzNhMmUzNGYxNDQ0NTJhZDIxNDg5OGMxMDM5ZDc4"><span style="font-weight: 400">"There she is!" a voice shouted from further down the street, followed by the sound of running boots on wet cobblestone. "The Talent that attacked Morno! Don't let her get away!"</span></p>
<p class="cnNjODYyNmJkNzE5MjQwMTZiMjAwZWJmMDQ4MDZmNWU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">More voices joined the first, creating a chorus of pursuit that seemed to come from all directions. "She's dangerous! Call for backup!"</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZGUyYmRmYzllMjQ4ZDNhODQ1MGJkOWUzOTM0OGZh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Argent pulled her into another alley, this one narrower and darker than the last. The buildings here were older, their stone foundations providing some shelter from the growing electromagnetic storm surrounding Kaelan's failing control.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZjUxMTZmZTE3ZTRiY2RhZDI0YTJmZjIxZDMzNGNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">"I can't contain this much longer," Kaelan whispered, feeling her control slip further with each second. The power wanted out, demanded release, and she was running out of strength to deny it. "You need to get away from me before I-"</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNGMxN2YyMGM0MTQ4MmQ4MDJkYWI5ZDZkMzU3MWQ1"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Just a little further," Argent insisted, her voice strained but determined. Moisture beaded on her face from the effort of channeling energies her body wasn't designed to handle.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYzZhMmNkYzRkZDRhZjViZjI0NGUyMGZmZGZjYjhj"><span style="font-weight: 400">They rounded a corner and nearly collided with Vertigo, who had somehow circled around to meet them through the maze of side streets. His clothing was singed, a fresh cut bleeding on his cheek, but his eyes were alert and focused despite the obvious signs of recent combat. "What the hell happened in there?" he demanded, seeing Kaelan's deteriorated state. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhMDA4ZjFlZGQ1ZjRiYzZhZGY5Yzc2MjZiYTA4YzAw"><span style="font-weight: 400">"She had to drink to maintain cover," Argent explained breathlessly, still struggling to support Kaelan's weight. "It's interfering with her control somehow."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4M2FkNWJmYWM4ZTQ2NjA4YWY2NjJiMTA5M2E1MmMw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo's expression darkened. "We need to get her somewhere isolated before she brings down half the district." He reached for her arm, then hesitated as electricity crackled between them, the air becoming charged with dangerous potential. "Can you walk?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNjNiYWNlNTc2ZTRlYWI5NGU4YzlmODg0YWViZWU1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaelan tried to respond, but another surge robbed her of speech. She doubled over, a strangled sound escaping her throat as she fought to contain the building discharge. Shame washed over her like acid, burning worse than any physical pain. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxMGU4YWQwNDdhZDQzNjlhNTU4YWExMjBkNDBlMTNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">A final, massive surge built within her, electrical energy crackling across her entire body. The last thing she saw before consciousness fled was Vertigo's face, concern rather than mockery etched in his features as he reached for her despite the danger.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwODBiYWQ3YjU0MTRmNjg5YzczYWQzYjhkYWJjNzI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then darkness swept over her, pulling her down into merciful oblivion as her knees buckled and she collapsed into the mud.</span></p>
