My sensors read several small groups of ships in orbit around Serenno—groups of six that seemed to be equidistant around the planet in six different positions, including over the poles. It wasn’t the tightest security I’d seen on a planet—that honor went to Coruscant, where there were hundreds of Republic Navy ships just </span><em>loitering</em><span style="font-style: normal"> in orbit—but it was more than I was expecting.</span></p>

Serenno Intelligence learned from some of the pilots still waiting to pick up goods that an order had gone out to all Trade Federation vessels, and from there to all traders, that the Trade Federation was stopping their trade in and out of Serenno and other non-affiliated traders were advised to do the same or risk angering the Trade Federation.”</p>

It’s turned quite a profit already. Enough to purchase ships and fighters, hire people to operate them, and start a small training academy on the surface. I myself did some service in the Republic Navy, before retiring home to Serenno, and was called to re-enlist temporarily to help train our new recruits. As for the patrols and increased security… the Trade Federation haven’t directly attacked Serenno, but they <em>have</em> been attacking non-aligned transports coming and going from the system. We’ve had to start rotating escorts for them. We’ve caught a few ‘pirate ships,’” his doubt about that claim was obvious in his tone, “setting up and attacking traders and the planet itself.”</p>

A bit of telekinesis with the Force had my bed made and then flipped up against the wall, folded away to make space, as the spare had been during my trip here after Siri used it. Dishes were cleaned and put away, laundry run through the sonic scrubber and put away folded into drawers, or into my bag since I would be leaving the ship.

<p class="cnMzNDg2NDU2YzM0MTRjZmFhZDkyZGRiZWIwMTBjMGM1" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">Humming, she looked over where the pylon joined the wing, before nodding. “I think so, yeah. So, what I’d do is cut this entire pylon off, smooth everything up, then add a mount to the wing and route the existing cabling from the wing into the mount, then weld the pylon back up to the mount. Gonna have to run new cables through the ship to your targeting computer. It’ll make them more vulnerable if they get hit, but if you’re fighting something that can punch through this thing’s shields, you’ve got bigger problems to worry about. That should give it a hundred and eighty degrees of elevation and a few degrees of traversal horizontally, and if you adjust the wings to the vertical it’ll be the opposite. You’ll obviously have more elevation or traversal once you move the pylons out of line with the wings.”</p>

They need to be elevated enough, and have enough traversal, to fire backwards and hit a target flying directly in my shadow and enough elevation to shoot above the ship.”</p>

<p class="cnM4MGM5NDg1NDc2NjQ0ODNhMjQzNGQxNmY4M2YwZTI1" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">Ideally, I would use the rear ion cannons to soften up a target before hitting it with the laser cannons. Shields tended to block one or the other, and switching over to block one would make a ship vulnerable to the other. Moreover, the default setting was to block blaster type weapons—laser cannons, turbo lasers, and so on—and ion cannons <em>could short out enemy systems, including shields</em>. So the winning strategy with the Skipray was to use the ion cannons to do just that and either knock out the enemy shields, engines, or both and then finish off its prey at its leisure with the blasters. So having some ability to track targets with both at the same time when it was needed would be good. I’d have to work out what I could do there as I had time.</p>

It pays to have friends in high places. But the queue behind you is big, so if it’s not a priority, it’s gonna cost you.”</p>

Even did some upgrades. One of the new recruits crashed one of the B-22s when we first got them and warped the frame beyond repair, but most of the internals were still good, so I moved over most of its systems in my spare time, since the Count was footing the bill. Engine, laser cannons, hyperdrive, shields, life support, computer and instruments—basically all the good stuff. You’re lucky I did, because that thing was a flying death trap—surprised you made it down into atmo with her in the state she was in. Then we ripped off the hull armor and replaced it with a new sacanium alloy to trial run the stuff on an interceptor. It’s lighter and stronger than standard durasteel. With that engine, the lighter frame of the D-6, and that armor she should outrun anything in system.”</p>

I expected to be ignored and have to find my own way to Master Dooku, but apparently <em>someone</em><span style="font-style: normal"> had been alerted to my presence in an official capacity, because when I entered the terminal I found a uniformed security officer waiting—not just</span><em> any</em><span style="font-style: normal"> security officer either, but one wearing the uniform of the palace guard unless I missed my guess. As soon as he spotted me, the dark haired man hurried over and snapped off a proper salute. “Ma’am! I’ve been assigned to bring you to the palace.”</span></p>

<p class="cnMxOGMzNDFiOWMwYzQ1NThiMTEyZjM4ZjcwYWNkNGJi" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">“Very well. Lead on,” I gestured, and the man turned an about face and hurried through the terminal at a brisk walk, his head on a swivel as he kept alert. He was tense and wary, but not at anything specific I could see. More a general wariness for our surroundings. It seemed the captain’s warning about potential unrest had perhaps been understated.</p>

I watched out the windows as we flew along, leaving the city behind and heading up the side of a small mountain overlooking the city. Soon enough, I spotted the palace Ramil had been operating out of before he fled—having apparently grown worried about the potential possibility of someone simply destroying it with him in it. I had no idea why he would be worried about such a thing, really. It’s not like there </span><span style="font-style: normal">had been</span><span style="font-style: normal"> any other convenient ships in orbit I could </span><span style="font-style: normal">have</span><span style="font-style: normal"> use</span><span style="font-style: normal">d</span><span style="font-style: normal"> to repeat my first eventful visit planetside…</span></p>

<p class="cnMwYWM4ZTRlMDUzNzQ3YjdiYTg0MWI1ODJkNTRhMDE1" style="margin-bottom: 0">I didn’t really like the look of the place, architecturally speaking. The building, grounds, and spires surrounding it were, quite honestly, ugly—with the building looking like someone had taken the design of a ship and just turned it vertically—with the two big… <em>things</em><span style="font-style: normal"> jutting from the sides looking like </span><em>over sized ears</em><span style="font-style: normal"> or, on a ship, forward weapon emplacements. I would at least give whoever chose the location credit for that much—the view of the city in one direction and the view off the cliff ahead overlooking the countryside in the other direction was sure to be amazing from the top.</span></p>

Getting out, I followed my escort as we took an elevator up to a security checkpoint. Instead of being waved through however, their security stopped me and had me go through a scanner—which, predictably, went off as it detected my blasters and lightsabers.</p>

The men flinched and hands reached for weapons, but when I didn’t do anything else, no one drew. Holding up a hand, I created a mage blade and flicked my hand down the middle of the chair. It fell apart cleanly and the guards watching flinched. “I’m never unarmed.

He didn’t step inside, instead posting up beside the entrance. When I checked the panel, I saw it only had three buttons. Reaching out with the force and finding Master Dooku, I selected what I felt was the appropriate floor and rode the elevator up.</p>

Taking in the immense open room—what I supposed would be a great hall given that this was a castle—a frown settled on my lips at the sheer <em>waste</em><span style="font-style: normal"> of it all. The ceiling was ludicrously high and the entire room was empty save for the far end, in front of a very large, green tinted window looking out towards the city.</span></p>

They looked up as I entered and smiled, Master Dooku waving me over. My boots were loud on the polished floor as I made my way up to the desk. “Master Dooku, Countess,” I nodded to the pair.</p>
