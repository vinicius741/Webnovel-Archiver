    Aria
   </strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>
  After arriving at the castle, I go ahead and find a random summoner within it and have them summon me a bunch of biological monsters to experiment on. Then they go off to do war stuff.
 </p>
<p>
  And the experiments actually prove to be rather interesting. Particularly the ones over my new blood.
 </p>
<p>
  The first thing I learn about my blood is just a confirmation of what I already learned before. It stays for about five to ten seconds before being devoured by death energy if it doesn’t touch anything. But if it does touch something living then it’ll begin infusing itself into the creature.
 </p>
<p>
  The second thing I learned is how it infuses itself into a creature. It’s a rather dangerous process in which my blood worms its way into their very being and soul, fighting against their life force in the process and reducing their lifespan very slowly due to their life force fighting back.
 </p>
<p>
  After that it’s basically a battle of who wins out.
 </p>
<p>
  If my blood wins, then it’ll fully merge into the creature, pretty much turning the creature into a strange sort of undead. One that isn’t like any other undead I’ve ever heard of.
 </p>
<p>
  The undead made by my blood have glowing crimson veins spread throughout their body, and they don’t need to eat or sleep. They don’t need any form of nutrients other than my blood. Willingly given.
 </p>
<p>
  And even then, it doesn’t seem to be very often at all. To the point that after I gave a drop of my blood to them once, they haven’t needed it again.
 </p>
<p>
  But I can tell just because it’s my blood flowing through their veins that they will need more blood eventually. That it’s not a one-time fix, but a once in a month or even once in a year thing.
 </p>
<p>
  All that said, if the creature’s life force is too weak and too stubborn to give in, then the creature will just kinda die. Without turning into anything.
 </p>
<p>
  And if their life force just fights off my blood without much issue, then nothing really happens. Other than some pain for them, some fatigue, and a slightly reduced lifespan depending on how hard their life force fought.
 </p>
<p>
  Overall, it should be a good way to deal with those annoying mana creatures that try to eat me.
 </p>
<p>
  Because mana creatures – according to what I’ve learned from books in the past – have incredibly stubborn life forces.
 </p>
<p>
  Meaning my blood will never be able to turn a creature born from a planet’s mana into one of those ‘crimson spawn’, as one of the researchers in the place I was experimenting on the monsters dubbed them.
 </p>
<p>
  Monsters are fine though. And so are humans.
 </p>
<p>
  Since neither were born from natural mana.
 </p>
<p>
  Monsters are born from human mana, whereas humans are just born with some small amounts of mana passed down from their parents that they grow and turn into their own personal mana while merging their parents’ mana.
 </p>
<p>
  I frown as I walk through the castle, my hand partially covering my mouth in thought.
 </p>
<p>
  The benefits of this new skill are quite numerous. Not only for getting me out of the stomach of a mana creature, but also to deal with people. Since the curse will make them entirely reliant on me. And they can’t even force me to give them blood or take it from me since it requires my truly wishing to give them blood.
 </p>
<p>
  Certainly makes for a nice bargaining chip if I can get the curse on an enemy.
 </p>
<p>
  They would be reliant on me to live.

<p>
  Although I guess it comes with some perks for them as well. Like not needing to eat, breathe, drink, or sleep. It also takes away their sense of pain.
 </p>
<p>
  Assuming they view those as perks, that is.
 </p>
<p>
  Some people actually like sleeping or eating after all.
 </p>
<p>
  I don’t really like eating, but not being able to drink wine would be annoying. And I do sometimes sleep just to pass the time.
 </p>
<p>
  Sleep is a really good way to waste time.
 </p>
<p>
  I haven’t really been able to experiment how the curse affects abilities and skills, though. So for all I know, their ability or even class could change. But at the same time, nothing might happen to those.
 </p>
<p>
  Don’t really have any people to test it on since no one wants to attack me.
 </p>
<p>
  Well, I’ll figure it out eventually.
 </p>
<p>
  Not like I’m in a rush.
 </p>
<p>
  So with that comforting thought, I proceed through the castle for several minutes.
 </p>
<p>
  Then I hear a loud warping sound echoing from outside, making me pause before I walk up to a window.
 </p>
<p>
  And the sight I find greeting me outside is… an unexpected one.
 </p>
<p>
  A massive portal high above the city and castle, along with dozens of other portals. Each of which leads to different places. Meanwhile the massive portal is letting out large fireballs that seem to be targeting soldiers, with the smaller portals letting out people that look rather important.
 </p>
<p>
  I blink at the sight, only to frown a second later.
 </p>
<p>
  Hmm. Looks like this war may be reaching its climax.
 </p>
<p>
  I lean over the window as I watch numerous bolts of silver metal shoot out to strike at each fireball, causing each one to explode before they hit the ground. And that sight alone surprises me a little.
 </p>
<p>
  Because I clearly recognize it as Shirogane’s ability.
 </p>
<p>
  Then an even bigger surprise hits in the form of a massive dome of silver metal stretching all around the capital city and the castle. One that covers everything.
 </p>
<p>
  I bring out my phone to see if I can find out anything about what’s going on, but the connection is completely cut off. No internet. No service.
 </p>
<p>
  No nothing.
 </p>
<p>
  That’s when I look up at the large dome to find it letting off some sort of vibration to the very air around it.
 </p>
<p>
  Maybe the dome is intercepting transmissions or something?
 </p>
<p>
  Judging by the looks of the knights in the castle, they all seem to be under the impression that this dome and the interception is the work of the enemies. But I know just from that dome alone that it’s not.
 </p>
<p>
  So this is what Shirogane has been planning all along.
 </p>
<p>
  The corner of my lips quirk upwards as I lean further over the window, linking my fingers as my hands dangle outside the window.
 </p>
<p>
  Well this is taking an interesting turn.
 </p>
<p>
  And…
 </p>
<p>
  I glance in the direction of where I sense Leopold, who is currently still trying to recover while dealing with the members of the Council who aren’t Arthur.
 </p>
<p>
  …this attack was most likely coordinated to finish Leopold while he’s weakened from his last clash with Arthur.
 </p>
<p>
  I turn back to the many powerful people I see floating down from the portals, each looking confused at the dome.
 </p>
<p>
  My faint smile turns into a full one as I begin chuckling at the sight of a certain silver-haired merchant slowly floating into the air to meet the many enemies, all of whom I’m guessing must be the leaders of the enemies. Judging by how powerful they are in comparison to the soldiers I’ve seen thus far.
 </p>
<p>
  And while Shirogane is floating up into the air, thousands of spears of silver metal shoot out of him and pierce straight through each and every one of the portals, somehow shattering them through brute force alone. Further shocking the enemies.
 </p>
<p>
  At this point all of the knights in the castle that I can see are growing confused. But it’s not just them. It’s everyone.
 </p>
<p>
  Everyone looks beyond confused.
 </p>
<p>
  I leave the window and quickly sprint in the direction of the emperor, deciding that I might be able to help Shirogane out a bit after all.
 </p>
<p>
  When I reach the man, I find him standing atop the highest balcony of the castle – the one attached to his own room – as he raises his hands up while casting spells that are sending out spears of golden light to combat the members of the Council of Darkness. Each of whom is still attacking.
 </p>
<p>
  And it’s a rather bizarre sight. Seeing all of them still fighting despite also looking at what’s going on.
 </p>
<p>
  “Aria, is there something you need?” Leopold asks, sounding strained due to his current seemingly exhausted condition. Then he follows up immediately with a brief, “Is it about that merchant prince?”
 </p>
<p>
  He’s certainly quick to catch on.
 </p>
<p>
  I cross my arms while looking up at Shirogane, only to surprisingly find him looking in my direction. Although it may just be because the emperor is here.
 </p>
<p>
  “If Shirogane were to deal with this situation, would you be willing to discuss the trade of magical silver with the Eternal Dynasty?” I ask for the very first time since meeting Leopold.
 </p>
<p>
  The emperor grits his teeth, no doubt not wanting to agree.
 </p>
<p>
  But he doesn’t have much choice in this situation.
 </p>
<p>
  He’s surrounded by a dozen enemies and weakened due to his fight with another Grand. Not to mention that Arthur could show up at any moment to make matters even worse, if he’s willing to risk himself with his own injuries.
 </p>
<p>
  Several seconds pass in silence before the Emperor of the Grand Silvanian Empire begrudgingly states, “I am open to negotiation.”
 </p>
<p>
  A smirk immediately appears on Shirogane’s face as he spreads his arms out and faces all of the enemies.
 </p>
<p>
  Having finally gotten the opening he’s wanted all these years.
 </p>
