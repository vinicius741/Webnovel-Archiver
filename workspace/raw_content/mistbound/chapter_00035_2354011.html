<p class="cnM4YTM4NDMzMDQ3ZjQ4ZmJhY2RmYzU1YWY4MGU2YzAy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Alone in her room, Maeryn was beginning to feel like she had somehow become the mom friend of her social circle. She’d just interviewed Peter, a Zephyrian airship engineer that Frankie had vouched for. The boy had seemed nice enough - a bit anxious, but not nearly so much as Ernesto - so Maeryn was willing to give him a try. Though she wouldn’t be spilling any particular secrets to him anytime soon; Ernesto being a necromancer was not something she’d share lightly. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZWQ0MTdjNmQ4NDQxYzg5Mzk1YTE2MTVkMDVkODFk"><span style="font-weight: 400">In any case, Maeryn had just realized a minute ago that her entire crew was made up of six teenagers - well, maybe five, since she’d never checked how old Ernesto was - about her age. And she was the one responsible for them all as their Captain and the leader of their efforts to combat the Mist. Abyss, she really was the mom friend. That was not a role she ever thought she’d end up in. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1Y2FiNjE2MDhiOTQ0NmZhOTA1ZjMxNjEyNDg5NGJj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn let out a sigh, trying to let it go. It wasn’t as though she had room to be picky about her allies, and maybe there were benefits to having the whole crew be the same age? Maybe? Even if she couldn’t think of any right off the top of her head? She groaned, shaking her head. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzMmJjZTBmYmZlODQwZDQ5MjBjZWU4NTIxMTdjM2U1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not sure I like the sound of that,” Terrance’s voice commented critically, startling her. Maeryn glanced out the window, and sure enough, the Zephyrian boy was casually crawling in through the window that she would have </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">sworn </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">was closed on a minute ago. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2NWRiMGJiMzE2ODQzNzc5MGIyNWI2OTkyNTBjMDRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn glared at him grumpily as Terrance finished pulling his legs in, allowing himself to fall forward onto the floor and rolling up to his feet in a smooth motion. “I have a door, you know.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM1NmI1YmE0NmIyMTQ2ZWFhZjNkZmNhZjkzYWQ2NmJk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And a perfectly good window!” the rogue countered with an insufferably smug grin. “So, what’s got you groaning?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwYzQ2M2RmN2U1ODRjNmY4Y2E4NDViZDc4MWNkMDAx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just realizing that my crew is made up of six teenagers, and that I’m pretty sure I just hired Frankie’s boyfriend to be my second pilot,” Maeryn informed him, her tone starting testy but sounding resigned at the end. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiOWU1MGI3OTU3MzQ4Y2U4NDkzZWEyZjFiNWQwNGZl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance nodded thoughtfully. “Invest in birth control?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjNTk0NTNhYTg3NTQ3OWI5YmJhYjhkNThmZjQzMTEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn’s cheeks felt like they suddenly burst into flames. It wasn’t as though she hadn’t had the same thought; years as a hunter had exposed her to awkward moments — livestock deciding to mate, or worse, stumbling upon older hunters making the beast with two backs. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0NTM4OGE4MjY0MzQ2Njk4YjdhYmE0ZDY4MzVkZDkz"><span style="font-weight: 400">She hadn’t been able to look her colleagues in the eye for weeks. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhNDJjMzI3YTgxZTRhZTRiNzhjZGU3ZmNiODE5ZDMy"><span style="font-weight: 400">But the idea of her friends doing… that was mortifying. And it wasn’t something she was ready to think about for herself. And she definitely wasn’t willing to talk about it with a boy! </span></p>
<p class="cnMwOTRmOTZkZmI1ZTQ5MGE5Yzc4ZjM1ODI3ZWY5N2Rk"><span style="font-weight: 400">She would rather go fight Keith the Undead Necromancer all over again. By herself. And maybe with one of her blades broken. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxNmU2M2FmMzlkYzQwNDFiY2Q1ZmQ2ODMwYzJlNWRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn opened her mouth to angrily send Terrance away, but was able to think better of it before she said anything. Terrance hadn’t said or done anything wrong. And… and it </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">was </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">important to address it. As the mom friend of the group. And the captain. They couldn’t afford to have Frankie get… pregnant. Not while on the mission. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhODA1YzA5OTAyMTQ2NmE5MzdkNmExNzgzNTI2OTE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">So, cheeks still bright, Maeryn squeezed her eyes shut and tried to calm down. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlMTQ3YjdhYWFlYzRkYzA4YzY0Y2EyMDIwODg3Zjdk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance seemed able to read every emotion on her face, though, and he chuckled. “Still embarrassed to talk about sex, huh? Yeah, I remember being that way.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MmNiOTkwNWJhMzRjYzZhZGYzOGI4YzFlYzRhNThk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn opened her eyes a smidgen. “How’d you stop?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3MmY1ZjNmYmQ1MzQxNzI5OGNiMjRkYjIyZDk1OGI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maeryn, do you have </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">any </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">idea how many times I’ve accidentally caught people in the act while sneaking around?” Terrance laughed. “I was mortified the first few times, but people are people. Eventually it just became something for me to roll my eyes at.” He frowned thoughtfully. “Then again, now that I’m on a team and not working solo, it’s possible that people I work with regularly will be doing it. Ugh. Don’t want to think about that.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZjRjNDQ1ODkxZTQ3ZDBhMjM3NzBmMjY1NTk2Mjc0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn let out a groan. “Exactly!” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyNjg4YzRhMTc1YzQzNTRiZDQwMGZiOWE0NGUyOTE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance sighed heavily. “Well, the wind’s gonna blow where it will. Let’s be honest, this whole mission to save the world probably isn’t going to be solved quickly. I’d be shocked if none of us got physical with </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">somebody</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> - on the ship or off it - before we’re done. Better to be prepared for it. Need help finding a pharmacy?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmNDk0YzBjNDBlOTQyNzg4OWYxNmE3ZTZmZDc3MTRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Geovan gave him an appreciative smile. “Please?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmY2E1MjcxNjUwMzQwNjM4ZGVmOGVlZDkyNjRlZDE0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, sure. But you’re handling the talk with Frankie on your own. Good luck telling one of your best friends to be responsible like that.” Terrance shook his head, though the grin on his face told Maeryn that he knew perfectly well what kind of mortification he was inflicting on her. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTY5YmUxZmUwZDRkNTM4MjQ0ZTkyZmRlNGMyNzUx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you don’t stop now I’m going to hurt you,” Maeryn muttered, her hands clenching and unclenching as she fought the temptation to throttle the rogue. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhZGI3NGRhOTllNDRkN2NhMTBkMDVkZGQxYWY0YTVh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance just gave her a thumbs up, before he sat on Maeryn’s bed, his grin slipping away into a concerned frown. “In all seriousness, are you okay?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOTg1YmU1ZTczNjRiYmNhMDk0Zjg1NjdlMGFhZTVj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn gave him a noncommittal shrug, not quite able to meet his gaze. “Why wouldn’t I be?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyY2JhMmJiYWY5NTQ0MDNhNjAzZjMxMDJkNDk2OTY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance scoffed. “Don’t give me that. It’s hard to be the one in charge, and you’re trying to lead a bunch of people who barely know each other - besides you, Frankie and Dan - into stopping a threat that we’ve proven has ties to the Undead.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NTE3MTM0NDc3ODQyNDBhZTYwOWZkMzc4OTJlNTQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn made a face. He wasn’t wrong. “So?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYjE4NWNhM2FjZDQ5NWM5NTA0NDA2MmQyMzZkZDEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance rolled his eyes. “So I want to make sure that the Captain I’ve signed on with has her head on straight. None of us can afford for any of us to fall apart. And somehow I seem to be the only one seeing that you’re having a rough time. So, talk to me.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjc0MDRlYzlhNjQ5NTE5YzUyNmZkODFhZjIwMzZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn sighed, slumping. Another thing he wasn’t wrong about. “I’m… I’m managing. Had a moment earlier where I wasn’t okay, but I’m a big girl. I picked myself up and I’m dealing with it.” She gestured at where her notebook lay on her side table. “I write in my journal most nights. It helps.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM1OGViZjUyNTc1MTQ3NzJiNjVkNDJhODdjZGM1NTcw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance spared a quick glance at the notebook before returning his attention to the hunter. “You might want to consider picking a hobby. Something that you can do while we’re flying for weeks at a time. We may not have known each other long, but it’s pretty obvious that you’ll go stir crazy if you don’t have something to do. And now that you have a second pilot, you’re not strictly needed on piloting shifts.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OTcwZjUyMmYzYzQ5YjViNDY4ZjUwNjZhOGVmY2U4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh. He had a point. She… she would have basically nothing to do. For several days. Starting tomorrow. That… that wasn’t great. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkZjdkZDBhOWZhNDQ3MjViYmVmOWUwN2Q2MTdkZGNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing Maeryn’s expression change into something thoughtful, Terrance quickly followed up on his previous words. “Not everything has to be about the mission, you know. Doing stuff for you will help. Promise.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5NjZlOGNiZDU4MzQ1Y2Y5MTgwY2ZjY2EzNDVkOThh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn raised an eyebrow. “And what do you do, oh wise one?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhMDFlODcyODk5ODQ4Zjg4OTc5ZDk3Y2IyZTJjM2Ji"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Me? I like to people-watch. I try to figure out what mood they’re in, then make up stories that might explain it.” He chuckled. “One time, when I was younger, I built this whole convoluted plot in my head about these five adults that I saw in one place together. They didn’t even know each other, I don’t think, but I’d built it up into a decade-long friendship with betrayals and one-sided feelings of love.” Terrance sighed nostalgically. “Still wonder if I should’ve written it down. Who knows, maybe it would’ve sold well.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiNzQ0ZDIyMDM2NDQ1ODZiYTY2ODExNzQ4NGI2NzQx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Huh. Maeryn blinked, looking at Terrance in surprise. That hobby almost certainly had something to do with the rogue’s keen perception; he’d literally been practicing for years. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0YWExZTI4OGNlZDQ3YTdiZTFlMWQ1M2JiNDdmNWRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, you got anything you want to try and get good at? Could be anything, as long as it’s small and portable.” The rogue’s words knocked Maeryn out of her thoughts, and she scrambled for an answer. </span></p><span class="cjE5ODI1MGM1MTgzODRkOTFhNmZjOGU0ZGI1ZmZkZTI0"><br/>Unauthorized content usage: if you discover this narrative on Amazon, report the violation.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM2ODM3YzU2NzkzNTQzODBhZDU3MTYwNjNhNDlkY2U3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I, um… I don’t know, really. I’ve been so focused on the Mist, or becoming better as a hunter, for so long, I… Do you have any suggestions?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM1MzY1ZmYxMGMyZDQwNGJhMDE5OWUzMjE2OTYyOGJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance shrugged. “Music’s a pretty popular hobby for Zephyrians. I think there was a shop two streets down, if you want to check it out and see if there’s anything that catches your eye?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM4YjBjMzYyMGNlZjRmODg4M2U1Nzk0NzFiYmE4MTg1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn closed her eyes, trying to imagine herself playing an instrument in a moment of peace and calm. Maybe? It would depend on the instrument, though. Maybe something that could keep her hands busy while her brain idled? It might be worth trying, at least. Worst case scenario, she wouldn’t be completely bored for a week, and she could try something else when they got to Zephyr. After a moment of hesitation, Maeryn decided. “Okay. Why not? You want to come with?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMzhlODYyZWU1YjQ5OGFiZTU2M2U5NzIzMDZhMTdj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure thing. I’ll help make sure you don’t embarrass yourself.” Despite his teasing words, Terrance’s smile took the sting out of anything he was saying. Maeryn smiled back, grateful that the rogue had come in to check on her. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxOGEzZTUzYThkMzQ0MmRhYWM2MjlkZDBlMzBlZWY5"><span style="font-weight: 400">She didn’t even want to think about how miserable she would’ve been, cooped up in her own airship for a week with nothing to do. Now </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">that </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">would have been a nightmare. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0ODY3OGRmMDUxMjRiZDhiZDE1ZTdkZDI1Y2UyZWMy"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was only a short walk to the music shop, and then the two of them spent some time looking through its wares. The shop owner had cheerfully given permission for them to try anything there, as long as they didn’t break anything, and there was so much to see. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5NmQ0YTUyODgwYTQ3ZGE5OTYxNmFkYTRmY2JmNTVh"><span style="font-weight: 400">There were all sorts of instruments, from an incredibly large, virtually immovable device that was beyond Maeryn’s comprehension - “that one’s designed for having music heard across an entire flying city; it’s only brought out for national holidays, and it needs at least four people to play it properly,” Terrance informed her - to simple flutes designed for children. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzOGJiMmYyYWIxNDRlNWY5NGZhNzk3MzEwYWFkNjFl"><span style="font-weight: 400">After walking Maeryn around the shop once, Terrance ducked away to talk to the shop owner. She could make out snippets of their conversation, “ - something that doesn’t… to learn… flexibility - ” but Maeryn was too busy looking at all the options before her and trying to visualize herself with any of them on the airship.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZmI4N2E5ODRlNTQ4N2E4MjBjYWUxZDY4MzQzZTA5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Whatever she picked, it had to be portable, without taking too much space. Which eliminated about two-thirds of the shop, if she was honest. There was no way she was fitting that drumset in her room, and that was wholly disregarding that Maeryn couldn’t imagine herself playing the drums anyway. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDFiN2ZiMDU5YTQ5OTM4NTg0MzkwNWNkMjg0ZjRi"><span style="font-weight: 400">The flute then, maybe? Maeryn picked one up that looked her size, feeling the heft of it in her hands. It was… light. Maybe too light. Even so, she used the reference guide that the owner had helpfully placed in front of every group of instruments to carefully place her fingers over the holes in the flute, and tried blowing into the mouthpiece. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzc4Y2RmMjhlMTQ3NDhiMzc5MDFiMTIzNWMwMWI3"><span style="font-weight: 400">It made no sound. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwM2Y3M2YxYThkYTRkZDdiZTg3OTA1OTc0Njc4OWEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn let out a huff of annoyance, looked at the guide again, and finally shook her head and put the flute away. She knew she probably had done something wrong, but she wasn’t really interested in something quite that finicky. There had to be something that she could play with her hands, quietly. An instrument with a firm weight to it, that she wouldn’t be afraid of accidentally breaking or bending. And it would have to be quiet enough that she wouldn’t disturb everyone on the ship. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjNjQxZjdjYjJjMDQ3NjRiNmFlZDFkZGM2YzJkZjAx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Now that she thought about it, she had a lot of requirements. Was there even an instrument like that? </span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZTM1MzQ2Mjc0YjQzYmVhNjI4OWQ2ZWJiMzMwZGQ4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Maeryn. Why don’t you try this one?” Terrance appeared by her arm with no warning whatsoever, and pulled an unresisting Maeryn over to a section of the shop dedicated towards stringed instruments of all shapes and sizes. There was a cello that was taller than any person that Maeryn had ever seen, small four-stringed instruments that she honestly didn’t know the name of, and everything in between. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhNmQ1Mjc0MmQ1MTQzZWJhM2NkYmI3Y2I3ZWQ2ZDQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn had barely regained her balance when Terrance picked up a guitar and thrust it into her hands. She took it dumbly, and it was only when the rogue gave her an impatient “hurry up” gesture that she realized that he wanted her to try playing it. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZDZhZTZmOGI4ZDQ0YzE4ZTU2ODUzZmM2YWRkZmVh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Feeling remarkably foolish and out of her element, she adjusted her grip, glancing at the reference guide, and tried plucking at one of the strings. It let out a low, pleasing thrum, and - heartened by the simplicity of playing it - she plucked at it a bit harder, resulting in the same sound, only louder.  </span></p>
<p class="cnM0OTE2ZmVmYTIwYTQ0N2Q4OGI4MjhmZWY3ZTM1YTg0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn blinked, glancing down at the guitar before hesitantly trying one of the other strings, as gently as she could. The note that played was much quieter that time, and Maeryn felt a tiny smile emerge. This… this could work, maybe. She could play quietly without disturbing everyone. And this instrument didn’t feel particularly fragile… and she had to admit, the sound was nice. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiYmI1NDAyZjcyZDRkYjk5ODg5MWEwYWZhZTU2NmUz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How did you just zero in on that?” Terrance asked the shopkeeper, whose name Maeryn had never quite gotten. “I barely had to tell you anything, and you just seemed to know.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM4MTdmNTNmODEyNzRkYTI4YzZjYjUyODQwYmRlNTFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">The shopkeeper seemed rather proud of himself, stroking his mustache with a broad smile. “I have never failed to find an instrument for anyone who comes into my shop, and I never will. I have a sense for these things. Come, I have a starter pack for you. Some spare strings, a guide on guitar maintenance, some sheet music to practice with, and - of course - a proper traveling case. And whenever you need anything, just remember that old Elton took care of you.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZDE1ODEyYjRlZTQzMTA4NTQ1YTE3NDRiMGM0MTRk"><span style="font-weight: 400">The next few minutes passed in a whirl as Elton packed everything up in the case and handed it over to Maeryn, who took it, overwhelmed at how quickly everything had finished. “Your friend here already paid,” he told Maeryn with a grin, and she shot a surprised look at Terrance, who refused to meet her eye. When had he managed that? “If you have any problems at all, please don’t hesitate to call on me. We always need more music in the world.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmNDJmOWJmYjA1NTQ3M2NiMjU0OTQxNTVhZDcxNDAw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I… I will,” Maeryn replied, looking down at her case and then back up at Elton, a complicated mixture of gratitude and befuddlement settling into sincerity in her voice. “Thank you.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjYWEwMmMyZmIxNTQ3MDQ5MWVlNDJiZmU5N2I0YWJj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not a problem at all. Music is a way to make magic without mana. A way to express your heart when words fail you, and a guide to peace for a troubled soul.” Elton’s smile slipped a little into something sympathetic. “Take care of your instrument, young lady, and she’ll take care of you too.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMxNWQyZDAyMzE0NzRkMGU4YmVmMmNjYWFkNzIzYzk3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn blinked, but before she could even think to reply, Elton slipped away to the back of the shop, vanishing from her sight immediately. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2NDgxNzI2Y2Q3ODQ2ZWY4NmI0ODQ1NmQ4ZWUyYTJj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come on,” Terrance called, still not looking at her. “You still need to visit the pharmacy, right?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzN2RjZWFlN2U4MDRmZjJhMjA4MjcyYmM0NWIxNmM0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn blushed at the reminder. “Right. Coming!” Despite her words, she looked back at the shop, with all of its fantastical instruments and supplies, and wondered why Elton had said what he had. “A guide to peace for a troubled soul…?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiY2JlZWJmYjczNDQzYWRhYjcyOGZmZDNmZjk4YjA0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maeryn…”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNDkyNDE0M2M2ZDQ5YmE5OGUyNGJlNjY2ZWQ4N2Jk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, sorry! I’m on the way!” She turned on her heel and jogged to catch up with her friend. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxYWE3MzQ5YTM5MDRhYWU4ZThiZWYwZWExYzhiZDVh"><span style="font-weight: 400">One embarrassing trip to the pharmacy later, Maeryn threw herself facedown onto her bed and repressed the urge to scream. Terrance had been zero help at all there, just smirking in the background while Maeryn stutteringly asked the pharmacist about birth control options. And the pharmacist hadn’t believed her at all when she said it wasn’t for her. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5MmYyZTZlY2ZiZTQyZGVhNzQ3MjNhZjFhZDE2Zjdi"><span style="font-weight: 400">And the knowing grin when Maeryn had said she needed enough to last a few weeks, just in case… Maeryn had never wished harder for the ground to swallow her whole. Maybe Dan knew a spell to do that. She’d have to ask. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyYjk0MGI5YjU5MTQwZjNiZDg1MzJiM2ZhMzNkMGE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That wasn’t so bad, was it?” Terrance teased lightly. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxODMzM2ZhNDc3OTRjN2U5OWRiMTVmYTc1OWM3NWJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn twisted her head to give him a dead stare. “Terrance, that was the single most embarrassing thing I’ve ever done in my life. That lady thought I was trying to buy birth control for us. Tonight. And the look on her face when I asked for three weeks’ worth…!” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTlhYmU3N2VjNTQ0NjI4MjE0ZjUyNmUwNjQxZjdj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance hummed. “She certainly thought you were in for a wild time, that’s for sure.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM2NjdkYjhmYzM5ZDQ2NTFhYmIxNmIyZTY0YmJmMjNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn buried her face in her pillow and groaned loudly. “Frankie had better appreciate what I just went through for her,” she grumbled into her pillow. “I hire her boyfriend, I buy her birth control… I don’t want to hear a single Depths-damned complaint out of her for </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">any </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">inconvenient thing I ask her to do for a month. No, two months!” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZGVlZTU2YjQ5YjRlN2NiYWViMmE2OWU4YjEwZjdk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Would you like a tip on how to make it less embarrassing next time?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiYTgxMzQ5NjFiNjQ0YzZhNjhkMmU4YmVkNDdkODVm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“YES!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZThmNWZmNDRiMDQyMzJiZTVmM2Y3NzkwMjg1ODhh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t make a big deal out of it,” Terrance advised. “Like I said before, people are people. I guarantee you that lady sold birth control to at least a dozen people today, but she’s gonna remember you because you were the picture of a stuttering, blushing virgin buying it for the first time. If you can pretend you’re not embarrassed, make it </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">boring</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, then nobody will care. And then it’s not embarrassing anymore.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM1N2JhZWYxNjc2MjQzMDk4ZDM3NTdmZmU1Y2VjYTQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn paused, then peeked her head out from where she’d been attempting unsuccessfully to smother herself. “It’s that easy?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMGUxYmE2NjQxYzRjZGViYzkyNWQzYTU0MzhjMTI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yep.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyNjZhMGNhOWI1YTQzODNhNGQyNGFiNDk5YzE3YjEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just… fake it till you make it?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjOTFmMjM0YTNlOTRmNTVhNGFhYWRmZmE2YmI0ODgz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance nodded sagely. “Just like every other confidence-related thing ever.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjcwMzIxY2IyMzQ3Njk5NTk4OTk0NWZmNzU2NTdk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“... Huh.” Now that he mentioned it, Maeryn hadn’t had any issues with her role as an airship captain lately, even though she’d been incredibly anxious when taking up the role to begin with. “You might have a point.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhZGE4MzQ3MDc3ODQ2YjU4YmFkZDVlZjcxZDI3YjA0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course I do. I’m a rogue. I have lots of points. Many of them sharp.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwOTVlZTEzZDFhYjQ4MzM5NGRjY2U4OTg3NzRjMmQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn groaned. “Boo. That was a terrible joke.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiZmVlMWQ0NDhhMTQ3ZWE4MTUyYjBkN2Y3YjQ5MDNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance laughed aloud. “But you’re not embarrassed anymore, are you?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM1NjFiOTg1MWQ5ZTQzMDFhZWEyOWFlZmQ4NGFmZDVh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Only of your sense of humor,” Maeryn grumbled, but she couldn’t repress the way her lips tugged upwards. “Thanks for the advice, though. I’ll remember it.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhOWUzZmU1YTkyYjQ5YmY5OThiYmM2MzEzMDQ4YjY4"><span style="font-weight: 400">The rogue smiled, the expression softer and lighter than his usual devil-may-care grins. “Anytime. Besides…” His smile turned wicked. “I can’t wait to see Frankie’s</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">reaction when you talk to her about it.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzMGMwZjNlMzI3NjQ1YzhiN2JkMDMzOTY2MDEzMmZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Slowly, Maeryn’s smile twisted to match his. “Yeah… you ready to see how red she’ll turn?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YWI5M2RiZTQ1NDRiY2Q5NDFhZWE0MzcxZWRkY2U4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance rubbed his hands together, clearly eager for their mischief. “Lead on, Captain.” </span></p>
