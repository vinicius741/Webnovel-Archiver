   At night, the docks of Asapaco were deceptively quiet. Moonlight glittered off the waves in the harbor, and the shadowy hulks of trade ships rocked gently at rest. Vertigo stood in the alley, Rat at his side, and scanned the area. Everything had to go just right if he wanted Yolanda to be proud of-
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He jolted as if stung. What was he thinking? Blinking, he tried to clear his head from the fog he’d just come out of. “What the hell?” he muttered quietly. Rat stirred beside him but didn’t respond. He’d never experienced anything like it before. Even as he chased the thoughts down, the compulsion to please Yolanda faded away. He bit down on the inside of his cheek, hard, the pain helping to ground him.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Across the cobblestone road, a light flashed from one of the ships. Once, twice, a pause, then three times more, then twice. Vertigo cursed under his breath. Evaluating what had just happened would have to wait; that was the signal. “Let’s go,” he told Rat. She stuck close to his side as they darted across the road, Vertigo hyper-aware for any prying eyes.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “She does that to you,” Rat said so quietly he almost couldn’t hear it.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Save it,” he growled. Well-meaning or not, now was not the time for distractions.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The ship’s gangplank was already lowered by the time they reached it, several burly, tattooed men lugging a crate out of the hold. Vertigo addressed the woman lounging to the side, smoking a cigar as her bored expression passed over him. “Chief sent me to pick up the delivery.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The woman hawked and spat, eyeing him in suspicion. “I ain’t never seen you before. Chief didn’t tell us to expect no new guy.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Rat remained silent, and Vertigo realized that this was the trap. Yolanda was waiting to see how he got himself out of this. Quickly he ran through his options. Set the ship on fire, and alienate a potentially valuable trading partner. Fight the crew, same. Leave without the cargo? Possible but would likely be considered a failure. Use Rat’s credentials, except if they’d recognized her they would have said so already. Bribery? He didn’t have that kind of money on him. What would Commander do?
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo let a cocky, arrogant smirk crawl across his mouth. Snapping his fingers in the air, he whistled to signal the transporters to come and take the crate. Instead, men and women wearing the clenched fist that was Yolanda’s sigil materialized out of the shadows, guns trained on him. His stomach dropped. “Shit,” he muttered to himself.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dominique strode out of a side alley, that insufferable fox smile playing across her mouth. Yolanda’s goons shifted stance, guns still pointed in the wrong direction. He sensed rather than saw Rat melt away into the cover of the docks and gave silent thanks that she had a survival instinct. “Unfortunately,” Dominique purred, “the Chief knows better than to think she can trust you. You’re worth far more to us as merchandise than muscle. It was kind of you to deliver yourself all the way down here - these fine gentlemen are here to ensure you make it to your new owners.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo’s jaw clenched.
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    ::Trap at the docks,::
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   he thought toward Commander, although at this distance he doubted the message would reach.
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    ::Yolanda isn’t going to let me stick around long enough for Bliss to get in.::
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   He let his palms start to heat, the familiar prickle of flame waiting to be unleashed. “And here I was looking forward to a nice long working relationship.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dominique laughed, musical and cold. “I have to admit, I’m a little disappointed. I’d hoped you might take us up on our offer before it came to this, but if you can’t be bought then you can at least be sold.” She lifted a slender finger and her goons took a step forward.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A sharp whistle cut through the night, a bird call in three quick notes. Vertigo tensed, recognizing Rat’s signal.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The explosion took them all by surprise. One of the mooring lines on the ship snapped with a thunderous crack, the heavy rope whipping through the air. One of the ship’s men fell into the harbor, screaming and clutching a bloodied face. Troops and crewmen alike scattered, diving for cover. In the chaos several barrels broke loose, rolling across the dock.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo didn’t waste the opportunity. He unleashed a towering fireball into the air, straight up. Even if his mental communication didn’t reach Commander, someone had to notice. The second fireball caught the ship’s sails. Screams erupted, the crew swarming like a kicked hornet’s nest. “Don’t just stand there!” Dominique screamed. “Take him down!” Fire wreathed her own hands, casting her green eyes in a hellish glow.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A second explosion rocked the night, sending up a shower of sparks that rained down from the sky and sizzled on bare flesh. Somewhere Rat was making good use of whatever explosives she carried. Dominique gestured and a circle of flame sprang up around him, licking up to the height of his head. He ducked and rolled through it, his skin hardened by long exposure to his own flames, ensuring that he was left with only superficial burns. Vertigo dove behind a stack of crates, feeling bullets whiz past as he patted out his smoldering cloak. He needed to get off the docks - too exposed, too many angles of attack. A searing jet of flame passing over the top of the crates proved his point. A bullet impacted his body armor like a punch to the chest. “Time to go,” he murmured to himself.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Another of Rat’s explosions provided the cover for his dash to the street. As he ran, he caught a glimpse of her small form darting between shadows. The kid was good - her timing was perfect. Two more bullets punched him in the back. If not for the armor, he’d be bleeding out on the street.
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    ::Commander! I need backup!::
   </span>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Don't let him escape!" Dominique's voice rang out behind him. "Chief wants him alive!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo grinned grimly as he careened around a corner. A final explosion lit up the night behind him - Rat's parting gift to his would-be captors. Another soft whistle guided him down an alley to the left. At an apparent dead end, Rat held open a hidden doorway, beckoning frantically. He slipped in as she pulled the entryway shut. Blackness enveloped them and he summoned a small ball of flame. Stone stairs led downwards into darkness. Water dripped and glistened down the walls.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “What’s this?” he asked as they made their way downward. A chill permeated the air and the scents of damp and rot filled his nose.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Old city,” Rat responded. “Underground’s riddled with tunnels. Stick close, it’s easy to get lost down here. I been mapping it since I was a kid.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo snorted. “You
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    are
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   a kid.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Am not,” she shot back. They came to a crossroads at the bottom and she didn’t hesitate to choose the left path.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Why risk helping me?” he asked. “There’s no way you can go back to work for Yolanda now.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Ahead of him Rat shrugged a bony shoulder, not turning to look back. “I work for me. Yolanda killed my brother after he wouldn’t join her crew, then told me I was either next or dead right along with him.” The barely leashed rage under her calm voice was palpable. “Heard you talking about burning it all down, figured you were my best chance.” Now she did glance back, flamelight glinting in her eyes. “So you better make this worth it.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Behind them shouts rang out in the distance. “Found the door,” Rat muttered.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Can they follow us?” Vertigo glanced back, putting a hand to the hilt of his sword.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Maybe. Hard to tell. They might bring in a tracker.” Rat increased her pace. “Gotta get to the cistern.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The passage continued downwards, narrowing as it went, until it opened out into a huge circular chamber. The path dropped away and below them Vertigo’s firelight and moonlight from the deteriorated ceiling above reflected off a deep pool of still, black water. A single crumbling stone walkway crossed the cistern.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “There’s another passage on the far side that leads up to the temple district.” Rat pointed across the bridge. “Get up there, we’ll be out of Yolanda’s territory.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo eyed the dilapidated stone with distrust, but the noises of pursuit at their back left him little choice. “Go,” he told Rat, shoving her forward. She didn’t argue, scampering across to the other side.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As he followed he set his feet with care. The stone was pitted and slippery and he didn’t want to find out what was in the water below. Halfway across the back of his neck prickled in warning. He turned, the fire in his hand flaring, just as Dominique stepped onto the walkway behind him, two men at her back.
  </span>
 </p>
 <span>
  <br/>
  The narrative has been taken without permission. Report any sightings.
  <br/>
 </span>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Run!” Rat hissed.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “No.” Vertigo settled his stance. “Get to cover, I’ll handle this.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “You can’t beat her, she’s second only to Yolanda.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “We’ll see about that.” He let the fire glove his hand, painting the chamber in crimson light, and waited. Rat hesitated, then darted away.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “You’re making this much harder than it needs to be.” Dominique sighed.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Last chance," Vertigo called, his flames growing brighter. "Walk away."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You know I can't do that." She gestured, and her companions lunged forward.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo unleashed a wall of flame that engulfed the bridge, forcing them to retreat. The stone beneath his feet grew hot, and he knew the ancient structure wouldn't withstand prolonged magical combat. That gave him an idea.
  </span>
  <span>
   Focusing his power, he sent a concentrated blast of heat into the stones at Dominique's feet. The ancient mortar, weakened by centuries of moisture, began to crumble. Cracks spiderwebbed outward as the section of bridge gave way.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dominique realized what was happening too late. She and one of her companions plunged into the black water below, while the second leapt to safety on a nearby column.
  </span>
  <span>
   Not waiting to see if they surfaced, Vertigo ran for the far side of the bridge where Rat waited. He reached the next passage just as Rat darted inside.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What now?" he gasped, following her up a narrow spiral staircase.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Up," she replied simply. "They'll be right behind us, but they won't follow us to the surface, too many witnesses."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   They climbed until Vertigo's legs burned and his lungs ached. Finally, Rat pushed against a heavy stone slab, and fresh air rushed in. They emerged into a small, overgrown courtyard surrounded by crumbling temple ruins. Stars glittered overhead in the night sky.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Rat immediately moved toward the far wall. "More will be coming through soon. Need to be gone before then."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Where to?" Vertigo asked, though he already suspected the answer.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Separate," she replied, not looking at him. "Safer that way. You've got your mission. I've got mine."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Hey…” He reached out and touched her shoulder. “If you need somewhere to go…”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She shook her head, cutting him off. “Nobody comes back from Yolanda’s bad side. And you’re definitely on it. I’m better off alone.” Slipping through a gap in the wall, she was gone before he could respond, disappearing into the shadows.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dawn was breaking when he heard the unmistakable sound of Commander's troops engaging at the edge of the district. About damn time. But he was deep in enemy territory now, cut off from easy escape.
  </span>
  <span>
   Behind him, he could hear Yolanda's men closing in. Trapped, Vertigo let his lips curl into a feral grin. If they wanted to see what a Talent’s power could do, he'd give them a show they'd never forget.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The sun crested the horizon as he charged, massive blade reflecting the golden light. The city guard opened fire, but he was already moving, his massive sword scribing silver arcs through the air. The first guard fell before he could get a second shot off. Blood sprayed in a crimson fan across the cobblestones.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Fatigue dragged at his limbs after the night's endless fighting, but Vertigo couldn't afford to slow down. He could hear Yolanda's men advancing behind him, trying to box him in. The street was slick with blood now - his doing, though the past few hours were a blur. Dominique was somewhere behind, lost in the chaos of the night. That hadn’t stopped her from calling for backup.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He caught movement at the corner of his eye - one of Yolanda’s, a young soldier, barely more than a kid really, stumbling to a halt at the sight of the carnage. The boy's hands shook on his rifle. Vertigo almost felt sorry for him.
  </span>
  <span>
   The half second of observation passed. Vertigo's blade moved in a whirlwind of steel, cutting down the guards who tried to rush him. He let the bloodlust rise, let it burn away his exhaustion. Reaching deeply, almost at his limit, he summoned one more fireball which glowed palely in the early morning light as he unleashed the burst of flame, incinerating three men who'd tried to flank him.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Their deaths weren't quick or clean. He saw the young soldier retch, nearly dropping his gun. The kid fumbled, trying to aim, then froze as their eyes met. Terror washed across the boy's face as he recognized what he was facing.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo stalked forward, sword dripping gore. He could end this quickly - the boy was no real threat. But movement behind caught his attention and he spun to deal with a more pressing attack, leaving the soldier sprawled in the dirt.
  </span>
  <span>
   When he turned back, the kid was lurching for his dropped rifle. Stupid to take your eye off the enemy, but Vertigo had to admire the guts. The rifle clicked empty - jammed, probably. He watched the soldier wrestle with the weapon, panic making his movements clumsy.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo's lip curled in a snarl as he raised his blade. He'd given the kid a chance to run.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The boy looked up.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Combat instinct screamed a warning and Vertigo spun, blade singing through the air as a bullet tinged off it. The street erupted in chaos as Commander's forces finally broke through, providing the distraction he needed to fade into the shadows and make his escape.
  </span>
  <span>
   Behind him, he heard the young soldier's ragged breathing slowly fade away. The kid would live to tell the tale - assuming he could forget what he'd seen here today.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo sagged against the alley wall, his body finally acknowledging the toll of the night's chaos. Blood - mostly others' - caked his skin and clothing. His muscles screamed with fatigue, and the places where bullets had struck his armor throbbed with each heartbeat. The sounds of fighting had moved deeper into the city, but he knew he couldn't linger.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "There you are, you crazy bastard." The voice, though whispered, made him jump. He whirled, sword half-raised before recognizing the figure slouched in the shadows.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Ellis," he exhaled, lowering his weapon.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The scout grinned, revealing a chipped front tooth. "Thought we'd find your corpse instead of you. Commander's waiting at the east gate with the extraction team. City's on high alert; Yolanda's pulled strings with the guard and half a dozen mercenary crews. Place is crawling."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Did Bliss get in? The evidence…"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Ellis shook his head grimly. "Couldn't breach the inner compound. Too much heat after whatever the hell you did at the docks."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo swore. "We've got nothing then."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Worse than nothing," Ellis corrected. "We've got every faction in Asapaco out for our blood, and Yolanda still has her blackmail material. Commander says to cut our losses. We're pulling out."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo nodded, the weight of his failure settling on his shoulders. "Lead the way."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   They moved through the city like ghosts, taking back alleys and abandoned buildings. Twice they froze as patrols passed nearby. Vertigo noticed the city guard working openly alongside Yolanda's enforcers; a bad sign. She'd consolidated her power faster than expected.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   At the east gate, a small contingent of Commander's troops waited in the shelter of an abandoned warehouse, well-hidden but clearly ready to move at a moment's notice. In their center stood Commander himself, his face stone as he issued orders in a low voice. When he spotted Vertigo, something like relief flickered across his features before vanishing.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Nice of you to join us," he said evenly, but the strain was evident. "We have a twenty-minute window before they seal all exits. Ellis, signal the others."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As Ellis moved to comply, Commander drew Vertigo aside. "Yolanda still has everything she needs to ruin us," Commander said, his tone flat. "Your infiltration is blown, Bliss couldn't get in, and we've lost our Asapaco foothold. Days of planning, one of my best operatives compromised, and nothing to show for it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The criticism stung, but Vertigo couldn't argue. "She knew from the start. She got into my head somehow. Some kind of mental manipulation-"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I know," Commander interrupted. "I should have warned you she had that ability. I miscalculated." The admission surprised Vertigo; Commander rarely acknowledged his own errors. "Saddle up. We move out in five." Several things clicked into place in Vertigo's head. The way Commander had with people, the way he could always get what he wanted out of a negotiation, the easy way he found jobs and allies... He stared hard, but the other man never turned.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Outside the crumbling walls of Asapaco, the corps had assembled the remainder of their convoy. Vertigo spotted Bliss and Nathan among them. Despite the situation, relief flooded through him at the sight of them both whole and unharmed. Bliss looked furious, her jaw set and eyes flashing, while Nathan's expression darkened with worry when he saw Vertigo's blood-soaked appearance.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You look like shit," Bliss growled as he approached.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Nice to see you too," Vertigo responded automatically. "I'd have cleaned up, but I was busy getting shot at."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Nathan moved toward him, medical kit already in hand. "Sit. Let me check those wounds before we move."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "We don't have time…" Vertigo started, but Commander cut him off.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Make time. I need you functional. Five minutes, Nathan."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As Nathan worked quickly on the worst of Vertigo's injuries, Commander addressed the assembled troops. "Asapaco is now closed to us. Yolanda has made her move, and for now, she holds the advantage. We're retreating to the southern camp to regroup."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Murmurs rippled through the ranks. Asapaco had been their primary base of operations for years. Many had friends, lovers, even family there.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "This isn't over," Commander continued, silencing the whispers. "This is a tactical withdrawal. Yolanda has overplayed her hand, and we will make her regret it. But right now, we move. Quickly and quietly."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As the convoy lurched into motion, Vertigo found himself in one of the lead vehicles with Commander, Bliss, and Nathan. For several minutes, they rode in silence, the reality of their situation settling over them like a shroud.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "So what's our next move?" Bliss finally demanded. "We can't just let this stand."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "We won't," Commander said, his voice distant as he gazed out at the wasteland stretching before them. "Get some rest," he ordered. "All of you. We've got a long road ahead, and Asapaco won't forget what happened today. Neither will Yolanda." He paused, meeting Vertigo's gaze. "Next time, we'll be ready."
  </span>
 </p>
