<p class="cnM5NzU2Y2VlMmRkMTQ5N2JiNTlkZTYwYmE3YTQ0MTcz"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Through all day, Tristessa couldn't get Tiara's warning out of her head.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYTU5NWRjZmVmNjQ0M2FhNGI4NzNkNzUzNzY2NmY4"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">At lunch, the afternoon she spent with Lucahn learning about glyph writing, dinner, and at bedtime: in the back of her mind, the matriarch’s words kept resonating in an endless echo.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjODU5YzY4ZjNkZTQ1NTFhZDY0NmRiYjc4YzZiMTU2"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Run and don't look back…” she muttered in the darkness, her voice muffled under the sheets that covered her head. The window panes vibrated in the face of a thunderclap that broke the stillness of the night, visited by a light rain, the first since her arrival in Nekrom. “Ah! Uhh… You're a coward, Tessa.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MjkzZGEwMDVmMjQ3YTE5NTM5OTY0YTA0MDliMzc0"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Angry with herself, she stood up and pulled the sheets aside in a show of foolish bravery. The penumbra of the room was a portal to a known, bloody, violent past… The play of light and shadow created illusions, showing things that weren't there.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhY2NjNjc3MThjYTRjZWFhMzM2M2I3OWFjMTgyNzUx"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Another lightning that broke the sky briefly illuminated the entire interior, like a flash from a photograph, and Tristessa's mind manifested a sitting humanoid shadow in the middle of the room. And two bright eyes that looked at her, close to the floor...</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMTFmODliNmU1OTQxNGZhNjQ0YzE3MGFkNWRiMWNk"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">It wasn't real. None of it was real at all, but in another timeline it had been, and that was enough for her to cover her mouth to stifle a scream.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYWVmZGRmMWNhOTQwN2FiZDk3MTkzNGJhMGU5YTcw"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“...Mmm, aghk...Kkjjj!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMzhhZGI2NzY1MTQzOGNhYzcwM2U0NDBkZjkxZjk0"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Her eyes filled with tears and boiling vomit accumulated in her throat, forcing her to jump out of bed and practically shove her head inside the metal bucket in which she was forced to relieve herself.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMjg3NzJkMjdjZTQxYmJhY2MxYjRkMWU4NTc0NDRj"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“<em>Pathetic</em>...<em>pathetic</em>...<em>pathetic</em>...!</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNjQ3NTg0MDcyYTQwMDhhNjM3MDFjZGRiNDUzMDg2"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Her breathing was labored and her body was the victim of sporadic convulsions. The mixture of urine and vomit made everything worse, and as she expelled the contents of her stomach and a thread of foul drool continuously fell into the dark interior of the bucket, she kept insulting herself.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOTAyZDFjZWZjZDQwYjlhZmM2ZTZlOWYzYTM1NDY5"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">For how terrified she was, for how helpless she felt, and now for the concerns that the conversation with Tiara had left her with.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMDc3ODg5YjAzYjQzYTM5NzIxZWIzM2IzYmYzYTJi"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“I can’t be <em>that</em> miserable, can I?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YTI5NTYwZTViYjQ3YzRiMDBmNGQxN2EyNDllNjNj"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">She was like that for hours, again protected under the indestructible and bloody white silk sheets, doing her best to ignore the smells coming from the bucket and the passing storm, until the light of the new day arrived. A dark grey day, with no more rain but with the presence of the Sun dramatically reduced.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZWNlNzU0ZTg3YzQ0YjRhZjM0MjA5YWRiYzIzNTg1"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Already dressed, Tristessa carried the metal bucket to the archaic bathroom on that floor and cleaned herself with water that had been replaced but frozen by the lack of pipes and a boiler. Then she went down the stairs to find the house submerged in darkness.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNjkwYjExNjJiODQyM2Q5NWJjMzEwNzRlZTA4MTdj"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“<em>Strange… Normally everyone is awake at this hour</em>,” she thought as she walked through the halls, careful not to make noise…and cautiously, aware of her surroundings. “…”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNDQyZjFiYzIxYjRlNzM5NjQ5Y2ZlMDFmYjM2ZTY2"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Beyond the Discord and the supernatural she witnessed in the intermediate states of Death and Resurrection, the darkness of Nekrom was… Creepy. As if there was always something there, watching and never revealing itself no matter how far one advances through the veil of shadows.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MTZiNWUyMDhmNTQ0OTBiNjZkOWQ5ZmY5ZDFlNjU4"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva"><em>“…there’s nothing here. Stop being such a coward!</em>”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYjU4ZWMyNDdhMTQ5YTBiYmMzNWEzZTNkZmE3Y2M5"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Admonishing herself, the girl continued her exploration, but never letting her guard down. In the left wing of the house, the couple slept in one room and Lucahn in the other, while in the right wing the rooms were divided into a dining room, a storage room, and an armory. The latter was the only room with light filtering in around the edges at the moment.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMmI3ZGM2M2VhYTRmMzU4ZmRmNDI4MDVjYmQzNTBl"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“<em>Hehe… The hunter, in his personal sanctuary</em>.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNGQ3Y2Y2NzZjYjRhOTdiMGExMmFkOTFmMThjODg5"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Tristessa knocked softly on the door, and soon it opened with a small creak. And Jin’s head peeked out and looked in amazement at the girl, illuminated by the light inside.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YTRmYmE1M2ZmYjRjY2FiOTRlMDUwNTcyNDc0MGVh"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Oh, Tristessa! Up so early?” he asked, surprised and confused by the grimace the girl was making, until she could not resist any longer and let out a tender giggle. “What’s wrong, do I have something on my face?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZTlmMGJiYzg2MDQ3NWJhY2M5NTQyMGVkMmI5ZDBk"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Y-yes, your beard is all stained with oil!” She said, her laughter increasing as she watched the hunter quickly pull a rag from the pockets of the leather duster he was wearing and wipe it over his face, red with embarrassment. “Ha… I needed that, thank you, Jin.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZTRmN2EyYzRiZTQ0NTJiZTYyYmVhMWZkMWE0Nzli"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Anything to see a smile on that cute face of yours.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOGZkNDU0NWUxYTQxYjE5NTJmMWQ3MTMwOTBmZjEx"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">The hunter grinned with nostalgia and stroked Tristessa’s head, unable to resist the impulse. The girl was not far behind, feeling a pull towards lost memories about her own father. Memories which were still hidden but had left a comforting warmth in the dark path in front of her.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNTMzNmM2M2MxNzQ5NDg5MDgzNzQ1ODQ3N2ZkZThm"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“You shouldn’t waste today’s morning, go and sleep some more,” the hunter advised her, distracting her from that surface-level mind delving. “Or did Tiara drag you out of bed by force before? Ha ha!”</span></p><span class="cjlkYmY1MjRmNzMwNjQ1YzBiYTI5MzljMTY5MTBlNTI3"><br/>If you stumble upon this narrative on Amazon, it's taken without the author's consent. Report it.<br/></span>
<p class="cnMyOGQ5ZDIyNjQ1MjQ2N2NhOWIwMzgxMDIwNGNhNWQ0"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“No, but I heard the stories about your wife and punctuality, I would not like to tempt fate,” she said, shivering at the possibility that the woman does to her the same thing she did to Jin and Lucahn when they slept overtime. “I still don’t understand what’s so special about today.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNTgyNTRkMDc4ZjQ3NzI5YWRlZTI0ZmE0NTVjYjI4"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Of course, you don’t remember: today is the seventh day and the end of the week. It is customary for non-military people to sleep a little later, after so much work and effort,” he explained. “As Nekronomika after creating all of existence, we also deserve a rest, don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NjYzNWY3Y2FlODRjZTQ4NjgyZTM4NDlkYWQyYjIw"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“I don’t see you resting right now, Jin. Nekronomika will be sad to know that you are not sleeping next to your wife, although she might feel a little jealous if you do.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ODVjNTBjOTJlYjRmNDk4ODYzNWQ4Nzk0NzZhZTAw"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">At Tristessa’s joke, Jin let out a laugh that he instantly regretted, as it echoed all the way down the hall.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MDM2MjRhNjY5MTRjYjk5YjRlZTA2NWQyYWNiNTlk"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“…you better go on, and let’s hope that Ursall momma hasn’t woken up.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YWU4OTk5MWMzMzRlZGJhYTg1NDMxNWM2NTViYzk3"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">The room housed a large work table made of wood, display cases with tools, and shelves full of weapons that Jin regularly used to hunt, either to bring food to the table, or to keep the predators that roam near the edge of the Sea of ​​Trees at bay. There was also a small altar where Jin had lit incense, in front of a beautifully painted canvas of a one-winged angel armed with a bow and arrow.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYTdiY2Y5ZWU0NzQwMTI5MDc0Nzc5ZTM5MTQ4Zjcx"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“What is an Ursall?” she asked, taking advantage of the light from the lamp energized with a power crystal to observe the weapons in detail. Hunting knives, machetes for cutting wood, various pistols and gunpowder rifles. “I think Lucahn explained to me in passing, is that beast similar to a bear? The head is in one of the display cases in the atrium, if I'm not mistaken.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZDBiOGMzYjU4ZjQyMDc4MzUzZWNlMWVlNDU4YTRk"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“I don't know what a bear is, but if you're referring to the beast with black fur, a small snout and a luminescent organ that attracts its prey, then you're right. Don't tell Tiara, okay? That woman has a good wrist for slapping.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOGQ4ZmIzNmY5MjQxZDBhNTM2YTkyMDY5YTNiZDM2"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Jin winked at her and went to the workbench to continue servicing a rifle that Tristessa instantly identified: it was the one Jin had used to shoot her in the previous timeline, and it had attached to the end that bayonet that had ended up extinguishing her life.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZmM5MzkyNjYxNTQ5ZWRiMWU4ZjUwNTA2NjQxODI2"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Isn’t it a beauty? Regulus model, made of titan tree wood for lightness and stability, with a muzzle and handle to cushion the recoil… Oh, don’t be afraid. There’s no way it will spontaneously fire if the antechamber isn’t full of gunpowder.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZDRmMGJjNTUyMTQ2MDk4MzRiNGU5ZjAyM2ExMGFj"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Jin had interpreted Tristessa’s frightened stare for the wrong reasons. She let out the air she was holding inside, banishing the ghosts of her second Death, and broke eye contact. For the sake of her mental stability.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzUyMTQ1NDNiZjQwOGE5ZjdkMDIyZjkzZjI0NWE5"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Killing time, she devoted herself to observing the firearm sets, obtaining some technical information from the hunter from time to time that Tristessa did not fully absorb.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZjJlNmExYWYxNjRlMDU4OGFhM2VjNTMxMTZjZjIw"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Tell me Jin, why don’t you use these?” she asked shortly after, pointing to the only glass display case that protected two revolvers with a cylinder for pointed bullets, modern ammunition compared to gunpowder and spherical bullets. And therefore, more efficient when it comes to killing.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NWQxMDA1NDU0NzQ3OGVhMmQ3NjJiMzU1NmIyZTgx"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Oh, you have a good eye! They are a gift from a good friend who is no longer with us,” he explained, unconsciously stroking his beard and getting oil on it again. “Those revolvers are the sacred weapons of Gunslingers, they are worth a fortune in soul-jewels, and I am not worthy of carrying them. It is like wanting to wield the blessed sword or the greatshield of a guardian, it is simply beyond my reach.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYTRmY2QyZDVjZTQxOWI4YTg0M2UzMDY0YzMxY2M2"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Are there gunslingers in this wor…? I mean, are gunslingers important in Nekrom?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZWJmYzcwNGNmYTRmM2Y5ZTFlMmMyZWEyOTRmNDNi"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Of course they are. Being a Gunslinger is being an Imperial Knight: along with the Guardians, there is no higher title a man or woman can aspire to in the Empire of the Night’s Watch.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NDM3ZGZhOTdhNzQ2OTk5Y2JjYzQ0ZjAxNWZmNTNh"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">There was some nostalgia in his voice, but from the smile that adorned his hairy face, the memories he had were not bad at all.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYTE2Y2RlM2MzNjQ3YzZiMjRmNTQ4NmM0Njg1NDg0"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Hunting was always my thing, and Tiara served in the Imperial Army Intelligence Squads as a didactum for a few years. Neither of us aspired to higher status, but many of our friends dreamed since they were children of being knights and serving the Empire as Guardians or Gunslingers. I never heard from them again… I don’t know what happened to them, if they managed to fulfill their goals and dreams. Severus did what he could to bring us good news, but it seems that no one wants to communicate with us after we were banished.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNjQwYWQwZTMwYTQ3NTdiMWYyNDNlYTI1Njg2NmNi"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“I see…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NzgzMmNiYjYwYjRiZWZhZjNjODk0OTE3MTE5MjBi"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">The Empire of the Night’s Watch. It seemed to be taboo to talk about the subject in that house, despite living in that nation, in one of the six Dominions that comprised it. Tristessa understood it, considering the fate to which the imperial authorities subjected the Mercer-Archeos family.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NGZkMGI5Mzc0YjRlZmM4OTBmYTkxYzMyMTM5YmI3"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">All the mysteries and restricted information in that house were irremediably connected to the family photograph in the guest room. Tristessa's curiosity was voracious, so much so that it would not be a surprise if it ended up playing against her.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZTI1NjMwNGY5NzRiNDk4MTMwZjU3NTQ5YzE2ZGM5"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Jin,” she called out to him, watching as the man brushed a metal piece of the disassembled rifle. “Tiara told me about Mellion. The eldest son in the photograph, right?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMTg5NWU2ZjhkNzQ1NTk4NGZhMTY5M2U1ZDc3MTk0"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">The hunter did not stop his task, although the slight tremor in his hands was noticeable.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOTUyNTMwNjJiNzRhZWViNDI3NGFlZDRiNTZhNjIz"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“That's right…,” he murmured, his voice muffled. “Tell me, did she tell you about our daughter?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOTYzNmI3MTZiNzQzZjViZGJmNzIzOThhNWI4NjUx"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“No… Not a single word.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OGU3OGVkYTQxNjQwNTI5MDk1MDYzZjZmNGNjMGRi"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“…”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDk1NTcxZDQxMjRkODM4MjI0ZjJhMTdiNDI5ZDdi"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">One had to be blind not to see the pain imprinted on Jin’s face. The man was a mountain, firm and with years of experience on his shoulders that turned the soul into a hard, unbreakable shell. But when it came to family, the thing for which one returned home after a long and hard day of work, there was no barrier or mentality that could resist the birth of a tragedy.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NjAzMzU5NGFhNDRkNGI5NTNkYzY5NzZiMWUwNTE5"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">That’s why when Jin’s eyes filled with tears, one could see how deep the wounds he carried in his restless spirit were.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MTUyZTY2MDQ5NzQ5ZjY5OTYzMjM4ZTZhZjAxYWRh"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Tristessa wanted to go and hug him, to apologize for making him talk about a painful past. She would have done so, if it weren’t for Tiara’s voice breaking the stillness of the house:</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OWRiODFlZGMyMzQ3YzRiZGExMWM3MzliYWRjNjAy"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Jin! Come, quickly!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NTJmZTAwMGUzNDRhYTlhMjM5ZmFjZDM0ZGQ5YjQz"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">The hunter stood up suddenly, and both he and Tristessa went to the door in a flash. Perhaps they were both thinking the same thing; that the day had come to welcome a new member of the Mercer-Archeos family, but the woman transmitted another message, from the end of the hallway.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NzMyYWU3ZDVhZDQ4NTg4YjFjZTZiNzczMDJiOGU3"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“It’s Lucahn!”</span></p>
