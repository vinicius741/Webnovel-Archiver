    … Honestly, I’m not sure what to do about the Geovan “terrorist cell”. It’s not as though we’ll be in Zephyr much longer, and we seem to have reached an understanding with each other. But after learning about Terrance’s past, I have no idea how to feel about it.
   </span>

</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
    Why would Erina kill his family? Why didn’t she kill Terrance when she had the chance, if she was so dead set against there being another Nightingale?
   </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
    There’s something missing. But I get the feeling that the answers won’t be provided so easily. Which is annoying. I’ve gotten kind of used to getting my questions answered quickly. I need help getting lodging in Cloudreach, oh wait, Terrance came out of nowhere and helped me. I need to help Dan find out the truth behind the Mist, oh wait, the very first mission I picked up in Airspire took us to a necromancer who confirmed the Mist’s link to the Undead. I want to find the terrorist cell, oh wait, the terrorist cell contacted me directly.
   </span>

<span>
    … When I write it like that, it all feels frightfully convenient. I know it wasn’t nearly that simple, and I know I got lucky, but… Abyss, I have gotten spoiled, haven’t I?

<span>
    Coming back to the Geovans… I guess it’s a good thing that Gwen’s the one in charge. I can probably trust her not to kick off a war. Especially when there are other members who would do anything to prevent it. Like Farah. Depths below, I feel bad for her. I can’t imagine how she must feel right now, knowing that all of her efforts to give her son more time amounted to less than nothing.
   </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
    Though I forgot to ask why they attacked the airship academy; maybe I can ask Gwen about it later. I can’t imagine why any of them thought that might’ve been a good idea. Hmm.
   </span>

</p>
<p>

<span>
    We have to figure out this holy mana thing, quickly. Terrance was right to tell me off yesterday in the alley; we can’t get distracted. People are counting on us, even if they don’t know it. We owe it to them to get the job done.
   </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
    I think I’ll ask to join in with Ernesto and Dan soon. If I can learn a bit of necromancy, even if I never use it again, maybe I can offer a perspective that helps with their understanding. Anything if it means we can develop holy mana faster. I won’t lie and say that the idea of delving into that forbidden magic doesn’t scare me. It’s just one more thing that might get in the way of ever going home again, one more thing that’ll get me killed if we get caught.
   </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
    One more thing that my parents might reject me for when we’re done.
   </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
    … Depths and damnation, now I’m crying. I don’t need this right now.
   </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
    No, you know what? If they have a problem with my methods, then they should have come up and figured this wyvern shit out themselves. I’m going to do what needs to be done, and they can learn to live with the fact that they raised their daughter to do what’s right.
   </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn closed her journal and wiped her eyes roughly with her arm. She took a deep, fortifying breath, and when she exhaled, she was calmer. “Okay, Maeryn,” she murmured to herself. “What’s on the agenda for today?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance had vanished first thing in the morning, no doubt delving back into the underworld of Zephyr. Maybe he’d be able to find some old connections, maybe he’d make new ones, but Maeryn respected his determination to become the next Nightingale. He’d be back, eventually.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Dan and Ernesto were holed up in their room again, no doubt looking through some of the
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Cold
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   -aligned spells in Ernesto’s Compendium. It wasn’t as though they had the resources in the hotel to practice
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Acid
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   or
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Undead
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   ones.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Frankie and Peter were off doing… something. Maeryn honestly wasn’t sure what they were up to, and she wasn’t sure she wanted to know. With the airship academy closed off to outsiders, it wasn’t as though they could go there and tinker. “Maybe they’re just exploring…?” she mused. She’d ask them when they returned for dinner.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   But that left Maeryn, and she didn’t really know what to do with her time. While she could practice with her guitar, or continue studying the mana theory books that she’d borrowed from Dan, those were things she could do on Stonewing. Was there anything here on Zephyr that she should do while she was in the area? Anything that was a better use of her time?
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Just to make sure she didn’t miss anything, Maeryn went downstairs to the front desk, and - as expected - found no new messages waiting for her. Electing to have some breakfast while she figured out her day, she moved to the communal dining area and picked out a couple of fruits and some sausages.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The food was simple but tasty, but even so, Maeryn’s mind drifted indecisively. She would’ve liked to catch up with Gwen, but had no idea where to find her. She considered trying to find the old Nightshade family home and explore, but discarded it as not only impractical - there was no way she’d be allowed anywhere close if the security around the noble sector was anything like Cloudreach - but also disrespectful to Terrance. The airship academy was completely closed off, too, which eliminated any possibility of finding a wing-combat specialist.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   No… there was nowhere in particular that Maeryn felt particularly strongly about.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Just as she resolved to head back upstairs and see if Dan and Ernesto would mind if she joined in, there was a polite cough from directly behind her. Maeryn blinked and turned around, swallowing the last of her sausage.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   A pair of uniformed guardsmen stood, with one a meter or so behind the other. The closer one was slightly stockier, but well-muscled with a saber sheathed at his belt. Maeryn could immediately tell from his stance that he wasn’t expecting trouble, but he was ready for it just in case.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Now that she was paying more attention to her surroundings, Maeryn noticed that all the murmur of conversation from other diners had ceased, as they watched silently. Maeryn tensed; was she under arrest for something? Maybe they somehow found out she’d been to the Council of Winds headquarters the previous night? Had they miraculously discovered that Ernesto was a necromancer? Had someone put together that she was Geovan and assumed that she was part of the terrorist cell? There were too many possibilities. “Can I help you?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Captain Maeryn of the airship Stonewing?” the guard asked crisply.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Yes, that’s me. Is something wrong?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I’m afraid there’s been an incident. You need to come with us.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn swallowed, her throat feeling unnaturally dry. “Alright… will this take long? I’m currently awaiting word from my client.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I couldn’t say, Captain,” the guard replied simply.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I see… just give me a minute to leave a message at the front desk, then. I assume that’s alright?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Certainly.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn left two messages - one for her crew, if anyone asked where she was, and one for Parlor in the event that he tried to get ahold of her. After that, she tried to ignore the gossiping whispers and followed the guards as they led her outside of the building.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The guards took their positions - one in front of her, one behind to prevent her from slipping away - and Maeryn helplessly followed them down the streets, wondering what exactly was going on. “I don’t suppose you can tell me anything before we get there?” she tried hopefully.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Afraid not, Captain.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Thankfully for Maeryn’s nerves, it only took a few more minutes to reach their destination - it appeared to be a building specifically for guards, though the name of it escaped her. She was escorted inside and taken to a plain room with chairs and a table, and asked to wait there.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   She took a seat, nervously tapping at her leg. At least there was one bit of good news: if they took her here, instead of a cell, then… they probably just wanted to talk? But why the secrecy? Unless they were here to interrogate her privately and
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    then
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   arrest her. The scenario was worryingly plausible.

<p>
<span>
   If only she had some kind of clue what they wanted….
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn’s thoughts were interrupted when a uniformed woman walked inside and sat down heavily across from her. “Apologies for the inconvenience, Captain,” the woman began briskly, her voice carrying a tone of authority that matched her sharp gaze. “But certain matters have come up that have made things unexpectedly volatile, and privacy is the word of the day. Do I have your word that anything discussed here will remain confidential?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn blinked. She… wasn’t being interrogated? What under the sky was happening here? But there was only one answer she could give if she wanted answers. Her mind flashed back to Captain Jenkins and how he’d sworn a secrecy oath to her. Swallowing, Maeryn nodded and opened her mouth to respond. “By the winds, I’ll keep my mouth shut.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Good enough.” The woman nodded once, curtly. “You can call me Marshall. First, I regret to inform you that your client, Samuel Parlor, is dead.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn blinked, nonplussed at the sudden topic change. Then the words sank in, like cold water poured over her head. “What? He’s dead?” She sat up straighter, her heartbeat quickening. Was she a suspect?
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Yes. It appears he was killed this morning, sometime between two and seven.” Marshall grimaced. “He was stabbed through the heart from behind. No signs of struggle. Everything points to it being an assassination from a rival family.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn’s stomach twisted slightly - but only slightly. Parlor was a noble - he must have known the risks, and what he was getting into when he chose to come to Zephyr. And he’d purposely kept Maeryn and her crew well away from him just in case of such an event. There was absolutely nothing she could have done to prevent it.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   She took a deep breath and released it slowly, gathering her thoughts. “Okay… While I appreciate being informed of my client’s death - meaning that I should get my crew together and go home once we’re done here - I don’t understand why you’re telling me the circumstances. What exactly do you want from me?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Marshall nodded approvingly. “What I want from you, Captain, is information.” She leaned forward intently, clasping her hands and resting them on the table. “How did you know Samuel Parlor? Tell me everything you can think of. Any actions he may have taken, anything he might have said, that struck you as strange. Also, I require authorization to search the areas he was permitted aboard your airship.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn sighed, and went into as much detail as she could remember. How she’d found his request in Airspire’s recruitment center, how they’d met to finalize the details. How she’d found it a little odd that he wasn’t requesting a larger airship that would give him the trappings of comfort while he traveled. How he’d told her that he preferred solitude and quiet. Her impressions of him being skilled with a blade based on his movements. How she’d barely seen him at all during their trip.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Marshall had taken out a notebook and started taking notes when Maeryn got going, and tapped her pencil twice against the table when Maeryn finally ran out of things to say. “And the permission to search your airship?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “You have it,” the hunter replied cautiously, “but I’m going to insist that I be present so I can point out what areas were accessible. One section of the airship is an alchemical lab, and I’d really rather no one accidentally blow up my airship.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Marshall grunted and waved her hand dismissively, which Maeryn took as an agreement to the terms. “That’s standard procedure anyway. Just plain rude to intrude on a Captain’s airship without them present,” she grumbled. “Next question. Is it possible that Parlor was killed to keep you in Zephyr?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn blinked, taken aback. “I… what? How would that make any sense?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Your contract specified that you were to take Parlor back to Airspire tomorrow, if I’m understanding it correctly.” Marshall tapped the table again, meeting Maeryn’s gaze intently. “Like I said, this looks like one noble assassinating another. We have our best people investigating the scene, but everyone knows we won’t find anything that leads us to the killer that way. But we have no suspects. There’s no motive. The business deal he was negotiating appears to have been mutually profitable. There’s no reason for the family he was meeting to kill him. The Parlor family isn’t that significant, and there haven’t been any scandals in recent memory.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Then… why?” Maeryn breathed, drawn into the mystery despite herself. “That makes no sense!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I agree. Which is why I have to think… if there’s no motive in killing Parlor for anything he did, then perhaps the motive is in what he was
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    going
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   to do. And since he was going to go back to Airspire…” Marshall’s face hardened, staring at the airship captain before her. “That leaves you. Is there anyone, anyone at all, who would have an interest in keeping you, or any of your crew, on Zephyr?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn’s mind flashed through her journey so far, remembering the secrets they’d discovered. The Zephyrian Research Council had hidden the truth about the Mist’s ties to the Undead for most of a decade, and had housed Keith the Undead Necromancer in secret for far longer. Maeryn and her team had discovered both, and killed Keith. If the ZRC had realized her connection to either of those, then they could have done it.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Then there was the Geovan terrorist cell, and Terrance being the last of the Nightshades. Erina was the common link there. If Erina truly was the one who killed Terrance’s retainer and his parents, then she couldn’t put it past her to kill anyone else. Had she eliminated Parlor in order to keep Terrance nearby? Or… to keep Ernesto nearby, so as to induce him to use his necromantic abilities?
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn took too long to reply, and Marshall leaned forward, triumph gleaming in her eyes. “There is,” she breathed. “Speak, Captain. Tell me everything. You have my word. By the winds, your secrets are safe with me.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The hunter grimaced. She had to give Marshall something. She couldn’t admit that Ernesto was a necromancer - that would get them all killed. And she didn’t want to give out Terrance’s family history, either.  “I have Geovans on my crew,” she admitted slowly. “It’s not something I advertise, given the political climate, but… I caught wind of the terrorist cell that attacked the academy recently. It’s possible that the cell is looking for new members. I can’t imagine many Geovans living on Zephyr.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Marshall nodded slowly. “There’s more.” She sounded absolutely certain, and Maeryn swore internally, thinking furiously as she tried to figure out how to phrase things.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “We… may have uncovered some embarrassing secrets from the Zephyrian Research Council,” she conceded with a grimace. “Secrets that, if they knew that we knew, I could see them killing over.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Marshall snorted. “What, did you discover that their secret coffee blend has magical stimulants in it?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn couldn’t help but laugh, remembering Jake the receptionist and his broken runic coffee machine. “Wouldn’t surprise me,” she chortled, even as her mind raced, searching for a way to end the conversation. The woman was too smart, too good at sniffing things out. Or Maeryn just had a terrible poker face. Maybe both.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   In any case, if Maeryn wanted to keep Ernesto’s and Terrance’s secrets, she needed to give Marshall something shocking, something to throw her off. Maybe reveal that Research Master Graves with a necromancer? No, that would put a spotlight on Ernesto. But, there was Keith… Yeah, there was nothing particularly implicating about that revelation, Maeryn hoped.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   There wasn’t time to think of anything else, so Maeryn made a split second decision. “But no, Marshall. Much worse than that. They hid a sentient Undead in Airspire for decades.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Marshall froze in place for a solid three seconds, before exploding. “WHAT?!” She leapt to her feet, the chair clattering to the ground as she slammed her hands on the table, suddenly looking absolutely livid. “What did you just say?!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “You heard me,” Maeryn challenged, unmoved. “Sentient Undead. Airspire. Decades. His name was Keith Laurant. Hidden away by his parents for being a necromancer, discovered by his cousins when his parents died, and left to die himself when they were done with him. Keith turned himself into an Undead, killed his cousins, and was discovered by the ZRC. They’ve been hiding him ever since. Or at least, they did. Before I killed him.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “T-That…!” Marshall picked up her chair and sat down heavily, eyes wide and hands shaking. “You’re telling the truth. Skies above, you’re telling the truth.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn blinked in confusion. She’d expected Marshall to challenge her on it, not just… accept her words as the truth with no evidence. “I mean, yes? But, how do you know that?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Marshall absently gestured at the table, raising her other hand to her forehead as she grappled with Maeryn’s brutally delivered explanation. “Enchanted table. Detects lies. No idea how it works, just does.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Curiosity piqued, Maeryn couldn’t resist testing it. She looked directly at the table and said, “I’m a boy?” The table gave a tiny shudder, as if protesting the falsehood. “That’s fascinating…” Maeryn breathed, her mind briefly wandering to the possibilities of such an artifact.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   She was just glad that everything she’d said so far had been truthful - just not the whole truth.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “It’s a very useful toy,” Marshall admitted, slowly calming down. “I… I certainly wasn’t expecting to hear that kind of secret today. Do you think the ZRC knows that you know this?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “No,” Maeryn denied, shaking her head. “If they did, I’m pretty sure they would have gone after me directly. Why bother with trying to keep me here, when the ZRC has more power in Airspire, where I was supposed to take Parlor back to?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Marshall still looked and sounded rattled from the revelation, but she shook her head, visibly trying to clear it. She squared her shoulders and adjusted her posture, forcing herself back into her professional demeanor. “I’m afraid that’s not the case. I can’t go into details, as I don’t know the whole story myself, but… the Zephyrian Research Council has a lot more power in Zephyr than it used to. You need to watch yourself very, very carefully.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn felt a chill run down her spine as she bit her lip. “Then I suppose I have little choice but to fly back to Airspire. I still need to take contracts to support my crew, after all.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “About that…” Marshall’s face twisted, looking almost apologetic. “Do you remember how I said that the situation had grown volatile? How I required an oath of confidentiality?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Yes…” the airship captain affirmed slowly, a sinking feeling growing in her stomach.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Marshall’s next words only confirmed her fear. “The royal family has inserted themselves into the case. No one knows why. But they’ve decreed that no one in connection to the case may leave Zephyr.” She sighed, her gaze sympathetic but resolute. “Captain Maeryn, I’m afraid that you’re grounded.”
  </span>
