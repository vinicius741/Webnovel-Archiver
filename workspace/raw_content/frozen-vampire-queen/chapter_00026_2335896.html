<p align="left" class="cnNhNTI2OTViZWZjZjQ5MWY5ZjdiMzA3Y2QzYzZkZDM5">“Are you sure that was a good idea?” Sora asked.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM0Yjk5ZTM0ZjcyNDQ0YTFiNDljODAyNDAxMzk3NjBk">Karlack nodded and smiled at the little girl. With Arrow at the Inn’s stables, the two of them were off on their own. This whole arrangement was all a plot between Karlack and the dragon anyway. One that Sora was convinced would be good.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNmYWU5ZWMxZjg0YzQ5N2RhMTIxZWMzODE3NjY5MWYx">“She’s always worried about you, and her constant anxiety ridden mind will break eventually. It’s best to let her have some time with Lunaria. I presume this will be good for her.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM1MjY0NzFiZTcxZDQzNTI4YzVmYWUyMmFlNWIyOGU0">Sora sighed and looked down at the cobbled road. “Am I really that much of a burden?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNkNzA0YTk5M2NkYzQ3NzQ5YThjMDk1ODhjODc0NmIz">Karlack stopped the little girl by latching onto her shoulder. “You are not a burden. Mistress has just never experienced these things before.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNhNTQ4YmY2YmY1ZDQyNDlhZDM3YjFlM2NlZmE0Yzg1">Sora looked up, meeting Karlack’s face with an awkward smile. “I had always thought that she was a little crazy for talking to a sword...I never expected that you could turn into a maid.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNjZGRhNmY4OWM5YzQwYTM4ZGRhY2U0ZGQ0YzZjOTIx">The maid grinned and pinched her fingers close together. “You say that, but she’s still this crazy.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM2YTA5MGQ2MDYyNDRiNmViZjBlZWUwOWI5ZWUwNTIy">“How can you even know so much about the world if you were always a sword?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNjYzUyZWMzMmMwMDQ5M2E4NTNlMjQ1MTExYzk3Yjdm">To Sora, it was clear that her question stumped the maid. She watched as Karlack leaned back and placed a hand on her chin.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMwNTg3MzM4M2Q2NjQzMWM4MjRmZTdkZjlhZDM0Njkw">“I guess a lot of my knowledge comes from the mistress. There is much she doesn’t tell you or anyone else, and a lot of those memories were shared with me. Though, I have a completely different personality than hers.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNmNDQ1MWZjYmYxZDQxMWM5YTkyOGNkODM3ZTlkYzgw">Sora sat her tired legs down on a nearby bench in the shade, and the maid sat beside her. “She hides a lot of stuff from me, doesn’t she?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMzYzczMjc1M2ZkNjQwZjRhOWM1YjQyMTMxNzk3OTNl">Karlack shrugged. “I imagine it’s a bunch of boring grown-up stuff. And a lot of it she doesn’t know herself. Besides, you are hiding stuff from her too, aren’t you?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNmNjZmMDU2NTVlMzRkMWViMzJjZjJlZmRhNDhmZTE5">Sora looked up at the maid with widened eyes. “How did you know?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMzZDI3M2E0M2I2YzRiNzk5YzM1YTUyNWVkMWRhMzk5">“You’re a very obvious little girl, so if you’re hiding something, it will quickly become apparent.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNkMzIyYzkyODdkOTRmN2JiMTdhYTk0ZmQxZDJiYWM1">Sora frowned, and he cheeks inflated. “What part of me is obvious?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM3NDUyZGJiNDQwODQwYzI4OGFjNDA0ZTc0MTIxMjNl">The maid poked Sora’s cheek, and the air flowed from her mouth. “This is the part of you that’s obvious. Changing your nature is very hard, but I don’t recommend it anyway.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNhODc3YTNkYzFiZjRmY2Y4YzBjZWYyYjllOTU2NWQ0">“Why is that?”</p><span class="cmFlYTg1MmMxZTA2ZjQ4ZDdhYmI5ZmI4MDdkZGY0Y2Qz"><br/>The story has been illicitly taken; should you find it on Amazon, report the infringement.<br/></span>
<p align="left" class="cnM3OWU1ZGQ3ZDJhNjQzNTI5ZmU1NmI2NjgyZTUwZWM0">“Because I like who you are. You’re afraid, but you will still say what’s on your mind. You urgently wanted to travel with the mistress, and you did it, did you not?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMyNDhjYTI4OTdhMjQyZDZiMjk4OGIxNGQyNGNmYmM2">“I did.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMxNjdiYTE3ZGExYTQ4MTFiNjA3ZTU4ZGY0NTA5NjA0">The maid nodded and placed a hand on Sora’s head, stroking her hair. “I can tell that you’re always trying your best, and Mistress can see it, too.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNmOWVjYTBhNjc0YTRhYWE4Njg3MzEyZmZjNDlhODhl">Sora felt a lump forming in her throat and her chest tightened. The little girl leaned her head against the maid’s frill-covered arm, fighting down her tears. “What do I do when something is too hard to say?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMyMDUyN2ZmMDBjNDRjNzg5YzliZTMyODY4MWU0MWI1">“Do you remember what the mistress said? She told you that you could open up at your own pace, but I imagine this isn’t satisfactory to you.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNmMjIzNjBkYWJmMTQ3NTZiYWM1ZjQ1MmY0MTNhOTdi">Sora shook her head, burying her face in the puffy black frills of Karlack’s outfit.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM3ZDdiODk3ZTg2MzQ1Y2ViYmI1YWNiNWE1NmE2YTg0">“If something is bothering you, you can tell me instead. I promise that I won’t tell the mistress.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM5OTg1NTVjODE3MjQ2ZjY5ZTA0YzgxMWQ3YzJiNGYx">Sora looked up at Karlack’s sincere eyes, and she felt those tears threatening to come forward again. “The truth is this place brings back a lot of pleasant and hurtful memories…”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMxZmI1ZWUwNDg5ZDQzZWU4ZWIyMWE4MGJmZjgyZDlh">Karlack raised an eyebrow, waiting to see if the girl would continue.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMzOWM2MzQ0NWU5ZjRhNzY4OWU4MjQwOWYzMGYyOTc1">“My parents were both nobles of this city, once upon a time, and I was raised here when I was much smaller.” Sora pointed off into the distance, towards the towering castle structure and the noble district, her finger shaking. “I used to live up there.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM0ODUzYzdlMjJmZjRmNmRhNmJhYWI0MjU0NmQzNmI1">“I see…what kind of things did you do when you lived up there?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM1MDk1NDRhYTBhYTRlM2Y5N2Q2MTRjY2M4Y2Y5NWMz">Sora felt tears running down her face, but she allowed a small smile to slip through. The memories were as warm as the droplets coating her cheeks. “Papa always used to play with me in the yard...We had such a beautiful garden. I remember mama would scold him because I would dirty my dress every time.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM5YTAyODY5MjYwNDQ3NTRhZWI2ZTM1MTc3N2RmMzE0">“It sounds like you had wonderful parents.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNmOTQ0N2E3MDQ4YjQwNjg4NGQwMTkyYTViNDAxMGE0">The little girl nodded. “They were great. I’m sure that I lived the dream of all of the commoner girls. I was spoiled, and I didn’t know much about the world. I had no idea that the world could be so cruel. I had no idea that people could be so cruel.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMzN2U4NmJhNmFjYjRmODNiNWUwNGRiYzQwYjczNjNh">“What happened?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNhNDA1ZjBmZGY5ZDQ4M2NiZDdmNmU1MGRiZGU0ODI2">“Father lost his status as a noble. Our entire life was uprooted, and we were forced to move North. Everything after that was painful. We kept losing people. Many were faithful to my father and many perished along the road.” Sora paused and swallowed. “We lost our butler, our knight, and in the end...even my parents. Ever since I found Emma...I’ve been wondering when my time will come.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNhNGUxYWZhNjU2OTQ5MjA5NTRlMmQ0M2U2MzkxNzBh">Karlack hugged Sora’s head close to her body. She patted the little girl’s back as she began sobbing uncontrollably. “That’s such a heavy weight for a child to bear, but you’re wrong.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM5ZTQ1YjNmM2NiYzRjMzJiMTlhZDJjZWE5ZmYyM2Jh">“I’m wrong?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM2ZmYwYmNmZGVjNzQ1YmViMzJhZmMyMjY1NDYxY2I4">“Yes, Mistress will never let you go. Moreover, your parents didn’t want you to live fearing for your life. I’m sure that’s why they protected you all that time. They did not give up their lives so that you would have to give up yours. They gave up their lives, believing that you would continue to live, and they believed that you would find happiness.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNmMjBhODliMjU2NzQyYWU5NThiYzlkMTQ5ODZlN2Ey">Karlack reached down and wiped the tears from Sora’s eyes. “No matter what you choose to do, your parents will continue loving you and watching over you.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMyYzE4NzI3N2RjNTRhZThhZTVlODRkM2Q5M2UzMjdl">Sora nodded and clung tighter to the maid’s dress.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNmY2I0Nzk2MThhMDQ3YmU4ZWM5Y2Q4NzVhMDc4MGVk">“You’re acting like a grown up when you’re only 10 years old. You know what would make your parents really happy?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMzYWJjOWJjNTQxMTQzZTdiOTQxOGVhMTk5NTYyZDNl">“What?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM3NGRjZWYzZWI2ZjRiYTViNTFhNzg5Y2VlOTEyMjJk">Karlack grinned. “They would be really happy if you played more. You should throw yourself into a pile of mud just to see how Mistress reacts.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM3ZjlkMWJiYzQ5YjQxMDU4OTgxM2JkN2EyNzJjYWRl">The little girl giggled. “I’m sure she will be angry at the both of us.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNiNzFiNjExZGJlMDQ5YTQ4MTgxODNkNDAxODBiYTlh">Karlack’s smile widened even more. “And that’s what will make it so fun!”</p>
