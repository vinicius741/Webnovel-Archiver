<p class="cnMxNzFlMjhmYmJkZTRjMGFiNmNhMzk3ZjhiMTllOGE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">The assassin sprang back just out of Maeryn’s reach, his movements fluid and unpredictable. Maeryn and Terrance quickly fell into a defensive stance, the tension between them palpable. “Who are you?!” she demanded. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0Nzk3NWQwYTBlNjQ1YTRiZmVmYWMzY2VlODI5ZDdl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And who do you serve?!” Terrance added. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDM0N2NlZjBlMzRjYjlhYjNhZjQzODZhYTAwZWNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“My name is meaningless,” the assassin murmured, eyes wide in fervorous intensity as he lowered himself, preparing himself for the next attack. “But you should not have made enemies of the Research Council!” He darted forward, clearly aiming for Terrance, only to swiftly pull back as Maeryn tried to counter him. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjMWQ3MTgwZDk1YTQ2MDJiMjhjMmM2OWRlZDQwNmJk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance’s eyes narrowed as he adjusted his stance to be more aggressive. “We don’t have time. Maeryn, enhance and take him out! I’ll support you!” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiOTQxOWY5MmViZjQ4YWU4NmY0ZmU1M2ZkMTBlMGFk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Trusting her partner implicitly, Maeryn immediately grasped the mana around her and suffused her body with it. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">“Body Enhancement</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” she murmured, feeling the power coursing through her. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0MjI1NmU2OGNlZTQ5YmI4YzE0ODBhNjZiMmU0N2Y5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, tricky tricky… </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Body Enhancement</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">,” the assassin echoed mockingly. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0NzRhNjAxY2NmZDQ2NjA4YjVhMjAyMjE2ZmE2N2Y2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn’s eyes widened in shock, and she was almost too slow to block the man’s slash. It knocked her off her feet, sending her sprawling a couple of meters before she was able to fall into a backwards roll and come up again. “Blight! Terrance, he can do it too!” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiMjUxODZhMDQzMjQ3ZTY5OTQxMGY3YmFjODAzODcx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, I got that! Hurry up and help!” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZDFkZTY4NjAxZDQ3N2I5MzAxZWFhZThlZWY1YzVh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn let out a wordless scream as she threw herself at the assassin, blades flashing in the sunlight as she struggled to land a solid blow. The assassin’s reactions were too fast, though - he blocked and parried easily with his sword, taking little steps backwards to force Maeryn to advance and exhaust herself. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzNGZhYmE3ZDI3YTQ0ZDc4OGM1OTc4NTAyMjg2MTc0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn grit her teeth. Time to try something stupid. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fireball!” </span></em></p>
<p class="cnM3YWJlYjU0ZWMzNTRkM2Y4YmFmNDk2NzEwMDUwNDc2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?!” The assassin wasn’t prepared for the hunter to use that kind of magic while she was in the blast zone, and the spell landed directly against his chest, catching his shirt aflame. He shrieked in pain, lashing out with a haphazard slash… right before he fell to his knees and fell face down, dead. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiZTBmODkwYjE4NzQ5MjI5Mjg0YTc4ODYyZDhiNDNk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance stood behind him, his dagger slick with blood and gray matter from where he’d stabbed the assassin in the back of the head. “Maeryn! You’re on fire!” </span></p>
<p class="cnM4NTY4N2E5ZmY5MjQzMWZiZWNmOThlMDBjZWIzOWQ2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know!” Maeryn swiftly threw herself to the ground, rolling repeatedly to put out the fire that had caught on her airship captain jacket. It took several long seconds, but the fire was put out, and Maeryn’s chest heaved as she tried to catch her breath. “Thanks for the backup.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMxZTY1YTRlZjA1ZjQxMjQ4MTUxYTczMjNiOWM3OGY4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks for making an opening.” Terrance looked away, eyes focused on somewhere far in the distance. “We’ve got to hurry back home. If they were so brazen as to do this, they’ll know who I am and where everyone else is.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZjE0OTViM2NhMzRkMTc5M2RkNDc5OTg3ZGI4ZmRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn’s breath caught. He was right. She quickly gauged how badly she’d overdone it with her </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Body Enhancement</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, and realized with a measure of relief that she was a little sore, but okay. The fight hadn’t been long enough to do any real damage. “Let’s go.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjZmMWVkZGUxZDQ2NzFhYmVhMzY2YTM3NzRhOWZk"><span style="font-weight: 400">They ran, their footsteps echoing down the empty streets - the crowd was long gone, everyone running and hiding in buildings to try to stay away from the assassin who had just materialized among them. </span></p>
<hr/>
<p class="cnM3MWYyMzAwYjk3NjQyZGI5MzQ2NGUzYmIwZjUyN2Uz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Blight!” Dan swore venomously as he hurled another concoction through the window. It burst into crimson flame on impacting the concrete, setting a handful of Undead on fire. But even as the flames roared, the two necromancers in the back of the room unleashed Cold-element spells, snuffing out the fire with chilling precision. “Depths and damnation! Ernesto, do you have anything?!” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0M2Q4MzlmNThiOTRiZDQ5ZjZmMDBmZjViMzg5YTRj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto’s face was pale with concentration as he fought to control the situation. “</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Command Undead!” </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto commanded, pointing at the necromancers hanging behind. For a moment, the swarm of eight Undead hesitated, their movements faltering, starting to turn towards their previous masters. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2NTNjNTVhNGViNDQ1ZjJhOGM3Mzc4OGY1YWY0Njli"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">“Command Undead!” </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">one of the necromancers echoed, and the Undead once again began beating their fists against the door and rapidly-blocked-off windows on the first floor, creating a mighty din that had Dan and Ernesto gritting their teeth. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmNGEyZTdjOGVmYjRlMjc5N2UyZjI4NmExNjBlYWE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“If I can make a suggestion,” the ghost of Keith Laurant interjected as if nothing overly concerning was occurring, his spectral form hovering behind Ernesto and looking over the battle. “I would suggest a long-range </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Rot-</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">aligned spell against the necromancer support. Perhaps </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Necrotic Ray</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZmVhMDYwMTZhOTRlMmZhOGQ2MmU1YWI1ZWEwMjli"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure!” Ernesto gasped. “How do I cast it?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3ODI2OGNlY2Q4OTQ0MzFiZDFkZTFjMjE0YjVmOTMw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It should be fairly intuitive. Take the principles of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Rot</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Recall how all things decay in time. Everything dies.” Keith’s eyes glowed an intense, icy blue. “All you are doing is speeding things along. All you are doing is accelerating the natural processes of decay tenfold, one hundredfold, one thousandfold. The true nature of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Rot</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, after all… is </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Time. </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Focus that knowledge, that intent, into your finger, and aim.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM4YTY5MzY5YzY0NDQyZjU5YWY4NDU3NGIxNmEyYzZm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto’s heart pounded as he absorbed the wisdom of his predecessor. He felt like he was on the verge of a new understanding of how the necromantic concepts truly aligned, but he would have to meditate on it later. He had to focus! </span></p>
<p class="cnNlZDY3M2UyNGU5ODQ2YzE5ZDYyZWQwZTg0ZmU3OWI5"><span style="font-weight: 400">He squeezed his eyes shut for a moment, grasping his mana and trying to follow his teacher’s instructions. Rot. Decay. Time. He was calling on Time. His heartbeat slowed as his mana twisted, burning icy-cold at the tip of his index finger, and he felt himself slip into a place of perfect calm. He couldn’t hear anything beyond his own heartbeat anymore - not Dan’s shouts to hurry, not the pounding of the Undead about to break through the door, not the frantic attempts of Frankie and Peter to find more things to block the entrances with. </span></p><span class="cjFlY2YxY2U1NWVlMDRkOTk4YTgxYWNlZDE2NDBhNTVm"><br/>If you encounter this narrative on Amazon, note that it's taken without the author's consent.

<p class="cnNmM2M1NTQ5OGE3ODRkNTQ4NGM4MDkyMThjNTUwYzVi"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Thump-thump. </span></em></p>
<p class="cnNkZmFlNTUwNmRkNTRmYjA5YTMzZGM0NzQ3MGZlMDI3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto raised his finger, eyes wide but unseeing of anything but the necromancers in the back. He aimed at the one of the left, the one who kept recasting </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Command Undead</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. He felt his mouth form the words, but he couldn’t hear them. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">“Necrotic Ray.</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzMzkxNzdhZWE0MzQ4N2FhZGFiNjlhMmUwNDk4OWQ0"><span style="font-weight: 400">A pale, shadowy energy shot out from his finger like lightning, little branches of necrotic energy lancing out slightly from his spell in places, showing he hadn’t mastered the spell. But it was enough. He struck the necromancer straight in the chest, and his enemy staggered, clutching his heart and falling to his knees. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5ODA4NTQ5OTUzOTQ0ZTI4OWFmOTY2YTcxZmM5Nzlh"><span style="font-weight: 400">The necromancer’s breath came in ragged, panicked gasps as his heart shriveled away under the assault.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYTJhZTUxN2NhNDRkYWY5OTQ3NzZhNTQzMGZmOWQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">With that same unnatural calmness, Ernesto slowly turned his gaze to the other necromancer and pointed. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">“Necrotic Ray</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5MTAxNTM4ZmMwNTRjZTE4MmIzNWQwNTM2NmNjMzgw"><span style="font-weight: 400">The second necromancer, having seen the fate of his ally, had already sought cover behind a stone wall. Ernesto’s spell struck the wall instead, a burst of shadowy energy scattering harmlessly against the solid barrier.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMjk5MTM5ZmVlNTRmY2I5MmFiN2ZlNTFmZTY3Y2Fm"><span style="font-weight: 400">And then Ernesto could maintain his spell meditation no longer, and he collapsed to his knees, breathing heavily. Sound rushed back into his ears, and he winced under the sudden assault. “Blight,” he swore weakly. “Sorry, Dan.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM4YTkzZGQ3ODVkNzQ5NWRiMTZiYmUwZWY5Y2RiMTQ2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t be sorry!” Dan’s voice was tight with urgency. “Just catch your breath and try </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Command Undead </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">again!” </span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZDVlOWQyM2ViZTRiZjBhN2Y3OTE0MTk0ZjIyNGU4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hurry!” Frankie screamed from downstairs. “They’re almost through!” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTliMmY5Zjk2ZjQ3MmNiNGE3YTQzZWI3ZGY2ZTEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto grunted as he forced himself to his feet. “Right…!” He took two deep breaths, and grit his teeth as he wearily began to channel mana again. “</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Command… Undead!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” </span></p>
<p class="cnM2OWFmM2QwZDU1MDQ5ZTFiOTA3MjVjYzdhNWRhNTBj"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Undead paused, beginning once more to turn around. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhYjc1NTk4Y2MxODRhZTNhNDFkZGI3MTE3NzkzMDk3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Command… </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">glrk!” The second necromancer’s spell cut off suddenly when Terrance’s blade penetrated through his trachea. A moment later, Terrance’s arm blurred, neatly decapitating the necromancer and halting anyone from being able to override Ernesto’s control. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTliNjRjNDhmNTRhZTk4ZTM5ZWE0ZDBlZGRjNGYz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn dashed around the corner and quickly assessed the situation, pausing at the eight Undead who simply stood there, doing nothing. “Everyone okay?” she asked cautiously. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlNzgyN2E1ZmFjMTQ4MjA5OTIwN2VlMjgzZTViMmIx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’re all okay! But it’s about time you two showed up!” Frankie called out, looking outside through a shattered window. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0YTk3MTZhYTEzNzQ4Yzk4OTNiZDA1MTljMTFiMGU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, we were unavoidably detained,” Terrance drawled, rolling his eyes. “Ernesto, you want to group those Undead closer together so we can just burn ‘em all and be done with it?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmNmJmNzU4ZWVmZDQ2MGRhNTc5YjlmNGNmOWQ4YjQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto focused his intent, and the Undead did exactly that. Maeryn sheathed her blades with a sigh and tiredly cast </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Fireball</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Only a minute later, all of the Undead had been reduced to ashes, which quickly vanished in a gust of wind. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjYjQyYTg3ZDRjZDQ2MDJhYjk5NmFkYTRmZDAyMGY2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Frankie. Peter. Let us inside,” Maeryn ordered. “We’ve got a lot to discuss.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlMzg0ODMyN2JiMjQyOTI5YTlkNzBiYjE0MGJmZWQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Rapidly, the six living humans - and one ghost - stood awkwardly in the kitchen area. The smell of smoke from Dan’s alchemical creations and Maeryn’s final fireball still permeated the air a little, giving the place a somewhat unpleasant scent that lingered badly in the nose. On top of that, Frankie and Peter had ripped the place apart to shove furniture in front of the door and windows, and, well… it was a mess. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxNGNkMWVlNzMzMTQwYmJhYzEzYzQxMWY2MTNkZTQx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry for wrecking your house,” Frankie muttered apologetically towards Terrance, shifting her weight from one foot to the other. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwZmQ3MjIzNjAyMzQwZDY5ZDQ3YzVhZjA3ZDE4NDhk"><span style="font-weight: 400">The rogue waved it off, shaking his head, even if he did grimace at how roughly the furniture had been treated. “It can be repaired. Don’t worry about it. Maeryn? You wanna tell them what happened, or should I?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhODNkODVhYzY3MzQ4ZTc4ZThkMGNmYjI0YTU4NzM3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I got it.” Maeryn quickly summarized the day’s events so far. “And then the king gave us blanket permission to practice necromancy so long as we don’t hurt anyone.” She glanced outside, making a face at where the two necromancers’ bodies still lay in the street. “I’m pretty sure self-defense is fine, too. Especially since it seems to be open season on the ZRC.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzNmMwNWRjZDRhMTQwZDZhNTI1MjA4NzU4ZWNkNGE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, that’s a relief,” Ernesto breathed out, slumping slightly, and wiping some sweat from his forehead. He was still pretty exhausted from the fight, and was distinctly looking forward to being able to sit down and rest. “Now I won’t be killed by law enforcement for being a necromancer. Now I’ll just be killed by the ZRC for being a necromancer not working with them.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM4MWY0NDU0OTUyMDQwMWFiMjk2Nzg2ZjE4MmE4YTUy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stepping up in the world,” Terrance deadpanned. “Next you’ll be free of them, but just be killed by a random hobo with a grudge. Maybe one day you’ll graduate to no one wanting to kill you.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlODQ4ODkyMTk2ZDQyMDdhZWJlZmM5ZTdhNGY0ZGFl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now that’ll be the day,” Ernesto griped. “Pretty sure that’s the step after world peace.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMxMjA4Y2U2YzIxMDQ2MDdiZDUwZTMxMzNlM2I1Y2Y2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance broke out into a grin. “Ernesto!” he praised gleefully. “I do believe that’s the first time you’ve sassed me back! Progress!” </span></p>
<p class="cnNkYWNlYWQwZjY5YTRhNTA5NjE2ZGYzZDRmMzlmNDYy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto could only groan. “You’re a bad influence.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDkxZWNjY2NjZjRjYjdhMzI1OWUzODJkMzI1YTcw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Moving on,” Dan interjected, rolling his eyes, “it’s obvious the ZRC figured out where we are. We can’t stay here. What’s the plan, Maeryn?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzMTI5NDhhMDA0MzRhZGY4NGM1NTIzMTVkMWU1YWNm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The plan’s simple,” she replied, raising her head confidently. “We grab our shit, and we head towards the airfield. The king sent a messenger that way to get Stonewing</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">ready for us. We get there, we get on our ship, we get out. We fly around for a bit, and come back in a few days to check on things. The king and queen were both out for blood, so I can’t imagine it’s going to take them very long to take care of business. Once that’s taken care of, we get this place repaired, and finish making the inverted necro mana. Any objections?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmMTVlZGZlMjljYzQ3NTc5NGNkNzNjNDNhYWZhNTMy"><span style="font-weight: 400">She received a round of negative headshakes. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlNDI0OTVmYTA1OTRkY2JiMmJjZjg3ZDAxNzRkNDQx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good. Now, getting to the airfield might be tricky, considering the whole assassins-on-the-street thing. So here’s how we’re gonna do it.” Maeryn rubbed her hands, hoping that what she was about to suggest made sense. “Non-combatants - that’s you three, Frankie, Peter, Dan - will be in the middle. Terrance, you’re the best with reaction times and you know best what to look for, so you’re watching our back.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOTE2YTUxMWZjNTQ3MzY4YzA4YmU4MmIwZDIxNGRl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You got it.” The rogue gave her a thumbs up. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzMzMyYTE2N2ZlMDRkOGI4MDhjNDFjZjI2NWNiNDRi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll handle things on the left side. Ernesto, you’re on the right, but you’re not to attack anyone unless I give the word. You’re just watching, got it?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Y2YyZGE1YmZmMTQxODE4OWZmZGNjMzI4ODVhNWM5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto let out a slow breath and nodded. “Okay. I can do that. Let me just cast </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Vitality Boost </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">before we get going, and I’ll be fine</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NjQxMGVhMDcyZjRjZWZiNzBmZDgzZjdlYjVhNjIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn looked over to the only one of their group that wasn’t strictly alive. “Keith, I need you invisible above us watching for anyone that looks like they mean us harm. Tell me if you find one - distance and direction, if possible.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwZWQwNDhmOWNmYTQ0OWU5MDk5NDJmNjNmY2Q0NzEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“As you wish, Captain Maeryn,” the ghost confirmed. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkZjBmMDE5ZGYyYjRkMjdiNDBmYWVjZWRlOWRjMTY5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then let’s get going. We don’t want to give the ZRC any time to figure out their previous assassination attempts failed. Come on.” </span></p>
