<strong>
   Chapter 32
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  I invited Oberon and Puck to stay for the party that I had no doubt was about to explode, but Oberon shook his head reluctantly. "Loathe as I am to be a poor guest yet again, I have a great deal of work to do in the next few days. The information your library held for me will achieve a long-delayed goal, but only if I act with alacrity."
 </p>
<p>
  He smiled past me, and I turned to see the first settlement in Faeflight already bursting with color and music starting somewhere on the other side of my bedroom windows. "Besides," he said quietly, "this is your day. My presence will only put a damper on things. New kingdoms rarely spring up in Faerie, and it's a thing worth celebrating."
 </p>
<p>
  When I looked back at him, he was just offering me his hand. "I do hope that Faeflight's relationship with the Seelie Court will remain as it has begun…friendly and of mutual benefit."
 </p>
<p>
  I shook his hand firmly. "I see no reason why it shouldn't."
 </p>
<p>
  "Excellent," he said seriously. "You have Puck's number. Don't hesitate to call if you need anything."
 </p>
<p>
  Behind Oberon, Puck mouthed the word "Hesitate."
 </p>
<p>
  I smiled and nodded. "Thank you. Oh! That reminds me. Sparkle?"
 </p>
<p>
  Sparkle giggled and dashed away toward the windows. She returned a few moments later, carrying a small, hinged wooden box, which she handed to Puck.
 </p>
<p>
  Looking confused, Puck opened it and held it out for Oberon to see. It contained, I knew, a single strand of golden hair, a pine needle, and an acorn, collected by the Hall's brownies when they'd scoured the library after Oberon's departure.
 </p>
<p>
  Oberon stared into the box for a moment, then took it, closed it, and pocketed it. After a long moment, he lifted his face, and was again smiling at me. But as before, I thought there was something calculating in his eyes. "Nicely done, Lady Reid, and I thank you for your consideration. A last word about your new demense…territory in Faerie is a strange thing, shifting and changing according to the seasons and the ebb and flow of influence. When a human holds land in Faerie, that changes the nature of land itself, at least to some extent. I would advise you to find and walk the borders of your territory as soon as you can…that will fix the area taken up by Faeflight and prevent it from shifting and changing with its surroundings."
 </p>
<p>
  I nodded. "Thank you, Lord Oberon. It's been a very interesting experience doing business with you."
 </p>
<p>
  He laughed, an honest, genuine sound. "Yes, Lady Reid, it has been quite the experience. I look forward to our next meeting."
 </p>
<p>
  He bowed and I curtseyed, then he turned and headed into the woods.
 </p>
<p>
  Puck flashed me a quick grin, doffed a non-existent hat, and swept into a deep bow to me. He straightened and winked, turning as Oberon called over his shoulder, "Come along, Puck! We still have much to do this day!"
 </p>
<p>
  Then they were gone, the woods closing up behind them again.
 </p>
<p>
  I looked at Sparkle. "Thank god that's done."
 </p>
<p>
  Sparkle smiled back at me, then hugged me tightly. "Oh, I'm so proud of you!" She squealed. "You handled that so well!"
 </p>
<p>
  Penny stepped up on the other side of me, still in her human form. "You truly did," she said, then yelped and laughed as Sparkle dragged her into a three-way hug with me.
 </p>
<p>
  "Shine didn't seem able to fly," Penny said after Sparkle released us, "so I delivered her to the home she and Spice share. They're there now, and suggest that you draw one of your chairs over to sit with them."
 </p>
<p>
  I smiled. "I'd like that."
 </p>
<p>
  We walked together back across the clearing - my clearing, in a way it never had been before - and over to Spice and Shine's home. They were sitting together at a little table on the rooftop patio, with Shine slumped forward over the table, her head on her folded arms. Her wings were splayed open and drooping.
 </p>
<p>
  &lt;&lt;My wings feel like they're made of lead!&gt;&gt; she complained when I pulled over a chair and sat down near them.
 </p>
<p>
  "I'm not surprised," I said with a smile. "The way you flew out there, I don't think any fairy has ever flown like that before."
 </p>
<p>
  "Never ever!" Spice agreed. "You're the fastest fairy ever, Shine, and I'm so proud of you!"
 </p>
<p>
  "I am too," I said seriously. "What you did out there today was simply amazing. Thank you, Shine. Thank you very much."
 </p>
<p>
  Shine's silver aura glowed brightly and she sat up, carefully - if rather stiffly - folding her wings behind her. &lt;&lt;Thank you, Caley!&gt;&gt;
 </p>
<p>
  "Now," Sparkle said, shrinking down and joining Spice and Shine, "I think there's something that needs taking care of?"
 </p>
<p>
  "While we party!" Spice said, bouncing into the air and cheering. "Everyone! Today, we are citizens of the sovereign kingdom of Faeflight!"
 </p>
<p>
  The village exploded in cheers and applause, tiny trumpets rang, and many flags were waved.
 </p>
<p>
  "Come then," Spice called happily, "and speak your vows!"
 </p>
<p>
  "Woah," I said, "wait, I'm not going to end up owning every person in this clearing, am I?"
 </p>
<p>
  Penny laughed softly.
 </p>
<p>
  Sparkle shook her head. "No, Caley, but they need to swear their oaths to you and the kingdom. You know, we should have a flag."
 </p>
<p>
  "Oh boy," I said softly.
 </p>
<p>
  It was nearly noon before I managed to sneak away. In the end, every single resident of the village came before me to swear fealty to me and Faeflight, to Sparkle, and to Spice and Shine…in that exact order. For all that, Shine was unquestionably the hero of the hour, and I saw a lot of younger-looking fairies - female and male - dressed the same way she was…leggings, a tight top, and sneakers, in a variety of colors and patterns.
 </p>
<p>
  It was charming.
 </p>
<p>
  The party atmosphere was tough to fight, and I didn't feel like fighting it. It had been a couple of stressful days. So I just sat and enjoyed it for a while, listening to happy chatter and lots of idle talk about expanding the village. But finally I made my excuses and Sparkle, Penny and I went back inside.
 </p>
<p>
  "I really need to move a door to the clearing," I said. "Just for safety's sake. If I ever have guests in to the Hall, bringing them in through my bedroom just doesn't seem quite right somehow."
 </p>
<p>
  "Not a bad idea," Ken said from where he was leaning against one of my bedposts. "It surely couldn't hurt." I heard the window close behind me, and he continued, "All right, spill. You seemed to have a notion as to how to approach not knowing what Oberon learned."
 </p>
<p>
  I smiled, unbelted and unbuttoned my jacket, and took it off. "I need a change of clothes and some lunch, then I'll fill you in. Let's reconvene in my office in an hour."
 </p>
<p>
  An hour later…dressed down into black leggings and a dark green cotton tunic, and with a sandwich and an apple safely tucked away in my stomach…I sat down behind my desk. "Am I wrong in thinking we're all a bit uncomfortable with just how excited Oberon was with what he learned in the library?"
 </p>
<p>
  Three heads - Penny and Sparkle in their human forms sitting in the chairs, and Ken standing between them - nodded agreement.
 </p>

<p>
  I smirked, jabbed a button on the speakerphone, and dialed a number. It rang twice before someone picked up and a familiar voice spoke down the line.
 </p>
<p>
<em>
   "UNSDI London field office, Rhodes speaking."
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  I smirked a bit more. "Jessie, it's Caley."
 </p>
<p>
<em>
   "Were your ears burnin'?"
  </em>
  Jessie asked, sounding amused.
  <em>
   "I was just thinkin' about you. What's on your mind?"
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  "How would you like to help me put one over on the Lord of the Seelie Court?" I asked in the most innocent tone I could muster.
 </p>
<p>
  Sparkle and Penny both got wide-eyed, their mouths falling open in surprise.
 </p>
<p>
  Ken looked dumbstruck.
 </p>
<p>
  There was a long moment of silence before she responded,
  <em>
   "Please tell me you're not just yankin' my chain."
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  "Not even a little," I said. "I could very much use your help with this, and I'll trade you the ten cent tour of the Hall for it."
 </p>
<p>
<em>
   "Hell yeah I wanna help! Wait, explain,"
  </em>
  she said, then quickly added.
  <em>
   "No, wait, not over the phone. I could be there if fifteen or twenty minutes
  </em>
<em>
   …"
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  "Does your office have a closet?" I asked.
 </p>
<p>
<em>
   "Yes, why?"
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  I smirked. "Humor me."
 </p>
<p>
<em>
   "Happily,"
  </em>
  she said.
  <em>
   "Uh
  </em>
<em>
   …"
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  "Stand by," I said. "I'll see you in a few minutes."
 </p>
<p>
<em>
   "All right
  </em>
<em>
   …"
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  As we hung up, Ken was shaking his head slowly in amazement. "It honestly hadn't occurred to me. I haven't met her in person yet…can we trust her this thoroughly?"
 </p>
<p>
  "I think so," I said, at the same time Penny said, "She seems quiet earnest and honest," and Sparkle said an unequivocal and completely certain, "Yes!"
 </p>
<p>
  "Good enough for me," Ken said. "Let's find a door."
 </p>
<p>
  I rose and left the office. "The UNSDI has been very good about putting their best foot forward," I said, following that mysterious pull in my mind that told me where a specific door I was looking for was. "And I like Jessie…I think she's been pretty lonely, and she and I got on rather well. I'd like to be her friend. Think of this as me putting my best foot forward and showing them trust."
 </p>
<p>
  "Which puts the onus on them to reciprocate or break your trust," Ken said with an appreciative nod.
 </p>
<p>
  "Puck did say Oberon said you were thinking like one of the Sidhe," Sparkle offered.
 </p>
<p>
  "Try not to make too much of a habit of it," Ken said dryly.
 </p>
<p>
  "Here," I said, indicating a plain, cheap-looking wooden door. I drew the Master Key out from my choker on its long, finely woven chain, inserted it into the lock on the door, and listened to the clockwork sounds as I turned it a full circle. Then I retracted the chain into my choker until the Master Key again hung from what appeared to just be a little loop on the front of it, and turned the knob.
 </p>
<p>
  The door swung toward me, opening inward, revealing a compact and mostly bare office beyond. And I do mean bare…aside from a filing cabinet, a very industrial looking old metal desk with a telephone and a laptop on it, and a battered desk chair, there was nothing at all in the room.
 </p>
<p>
  Except Jessie Rhodes, of course, sitting behind the desk and just turning to look at the four of us, clustered in the door and waving at her. Her jaw dropped open.
 </p>
<p>
  "Fuck me," she breathed. "Look, I know our defenses ain't fully up yet, but do you have any idea how many wards ya just blew clean through without settin' anythin' off?"
 </p>
<p>
  "No idea at all," I said. "It would be very interesting to find out and run a few tests, though, don't you think?"
 </p>
<p>
  "Very," she agreed, rising. "I'd invite you to have a seat, but they ain't gotten me nothin' but this desk, chair, and filin' cabinet yet." She rolled her eyes.
 </p>
<p>
  I smiled. "That's fine. Would you care to join us for a spot of lunch at Oakwood Hall?"
 </p>
<p>
  "Would I!" She agreed, emerging from behind her desk. "Just let me get my things."
 </p>
<p>
  She was dressed casually in trainers, black leggings and a large, dark green men's shirt, which she'd belted tightly around her waist and rolled the sleeves up to her elbows. As she rose, she grabbed a black waistcoat that was draped over the back of her chair, and I caught a glimpse of what looked like short scabbards sewn into the lining before she shrugged into it and buttoned it up.
 </p>
<p>
  Then she opened a drawer in her desk and stopped in her tracks…literally froze motionless in a way I'd never seen a human being do before. Her head rose and her strange emerald green eyes met mine. "Please take no offense, Caley."
 </p>
<p>
  My eyebrows went up. "Over what?"
 </p>
<p>
  She lifted a pair of daggers out of the drawer. They were absolutely gorgeous, and I say that as a historian who appreciates the fine workmanship of expertly made weapons, but doesn't really like the things. But these weren't just daggers…they were
  <em>
   art.
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  The grips appeared to be made of brass and wrapped in leather, with a narrow, squashed W-shaped crosspiece. But it was the blades that really held my eyes. They were carved from some translucent blue crystal, wide at the base and tapering to a fine point.
 </p>
<p>
  "I don't go nowhere without these," she said, almost apologetically. "Don't believe for a second I'll need 'em, but they're as close to me as skin." She gave them a flick and twirl so effortless that they might as well have been extensions of her arms, then they vanished up under the back of her waistcoat, and her hands were empty again.
 </p>
<p>
  Between the fact that there was no way the short scabbards I'd seen inside her waistcoat were long enough to make her daggers disappear like that, and the gentle surge of power I'd felt when she sheathed them, I was certain magic was involved in keeping them hidden. Meeting her eyes again, I saw a curious mix of uncertainty and hope.
 </p>
<p>
  She was, I realized, sharing something private with me.
 </p>
<p>
  I smiled. "I take no offense, Jessie. Considering where you lived for years, I honestly can't blame you. For what it's worth, they're beautiful." I stepped back from the door and gestured for her to join me.
 </p>
<p>
  She looked relieved as she walked over and examined the door frame. "Well god damn," she murmured, caressing the wood frame before slipping her fingers over the opening into the Hall. "I've seen some crazy things, but this is magic beyond anything I've ever seen. If you're amenable, I really would like to run a few experiments with it. I'm sure my bosses would appreciate it."
 </p>
<p>
  "Put it on the To Do list, assuming everything works out," I said. "Frankly, I'd be interested to know myself."
 </p>
<p>
  "But ya don't know the UNSDI well enough yet," she said with a nod. She closed her eyes, stepped through the door, and - with a little gasp of surprise - staggered and almost fell before Sparkle and I caught her.
 </p>
<p>
  "Are you all right?" I asked, worried.
 </p>
<p>
  She opened her eyes, blinking dazedly. "Fuck me," she said again. "Do you have any idea how long it's been since I felt dizzy like that?" She straightened and gave herself a little shake. "I didn't think anythin' could make me dizzy anymore."
 </p>
<p>
  She looked back at the still-open door and frowned, obviously fascinated. "That ain't no Way like I've ever walked. Played merry hell with my equilibrium."
 </p>
<p>
  "As far as we know," Ken offered, "the magic of the doors actually folds space, so that when passing through you're not actually crossing the intervening distance."
 </p>
<p>
  "That'd make sense," she agreed, then looked him up and down. "You're a ghost."
 </p>
<p>
  "Mostly," he agreed, smiling. "I am Ken, Caretaker of the Hall and manservant to the Guardian."
 </p>
<p>
  "'Meetcha," she said with a polite nod, looking around the hallway we now stood in. "Man, you can actually feel the power humming in here. It's quiet, but pervasive. Kinda like bein' back in Faerie. Big mojo." She smiled. "Mornin' Sparkle, Penny."
 </p>
<p>
  "Good morning!" Sparkle said cheerfully.
 </p>
<p>
  "It's nice to see you again," Penny replied.
 </p>
<p>
  "Come on," I said, linking arms with Jessie, "let me give you the short tour."
 </p>
<p>
  She shook her head and gave me a thoughtful look. "I got a hunch you'd better tell me what you need my help with first. Then you can show me 'round."
 </p>
<p>
  "She's right," Ken said.
 </p>
<p>
  "All right," I said, then launched into the story about my bargain with Oberon, the founding of Faeflight, and what I was proposing. "So you see," I finished, "I think there's a loophole in my deal with Oberon that you can take advantage of and help us find out what Oberon learned. Will you help me?"
 </p>
<p>
  She made a thoughtful sound. "That's some loophole abuse if I've ever seen it. But I'm down with it. We've exchanged a few confidences, but only transactional so far. I ain't 'in your confidence' just yet."
 </p>
<p>
  "I'm pretty sure doing this will ruin that loophole," I said.
 </p>
<p>
  "Oh yeah," she agreed. "This is definitely a one-and-done sort of thing." She grinned suddenly, the first real, wide smile I'd seen on her face. There was a dangerous edge to it though…it wasn't a friendly expression, for all it was happy. "Must be my birthday, because I get to put one past the King of the freakin' Faeries. Hot damn."
 </p>
<p>
  "I'll take you to the library," I said, "but I'd consider it a personal favor if you didn't share anything about the Hall with your employers until I have some sort of formal agreement with them. The question is, what you want in exchange for helping me with this."
 </p>
<p>
  She shook her head. "This is a freebie, because I love it. Showin' me one of the Hall's doors can cover it if anybody asks. Keepin' the secrets of Oakwood Hall?" She looked at me seriously. "That'll cost you something else entirely. But I think you've got somethin' else you want to ask me for too; we can negotiate once you've put that on the table. And I think that's a conversation we should have after we've abused that loophole in your deal with Oberon. Show me to the library."
 </p>
<p>
  So we showed her to the library. When I opened the doors into it, Jessie whistled appreciatively. "I ain't no bookworm, but damn, girl. How am I supposed to find anything in there?"
 </p>
<p>
  I touched one of the doors lightly and spoke to the Hall. "Please give Ms. Rhodes full access to the library for the duration of her search, and aid her in finding what she seeks."
 </p>
<p>
  We all felt the approving hum of the wood as the door glowed gold briefly.
 </p>
<p>
  Ken made a thoughtful sound. "I've never seen such a strong reaction from the Hall before. At a guess, I'd say it's as uneasy about us not knowing what Oberon found as we are."
 </p>
<p>
  Jessie stepped forward into the open doorway. "Well…guess I'll see y'all in a little while." She entered and said, "All right, I'm lookin' for whatever Oberon was studying."
 </p>
<p>
  As the doors swung shut behind her - on their own - I saw a glowing mote pop up out of the floor and bob away into the stacks with Jessie hot on its metaphorical heels.
 </p>
<p>
  We waited.
 </p>
<p>
  Almost an hour later, the doors opened and Jessie emerged. "I want a library card," she said bluntly. Then she handed me a yellow legal pad she hadn't had when she entered. "Hall was nice enough to point me to a cabinet of notepads and the like. Mortal magic ain't my strong suit, but it looks to me like he was lookin' to break some wards."
 </p>
<p>
  I took the legal pad from her and flipped through the first half-dozen pages, which were covered with notes (Jessie had very precise, very blocky handwriting), clusters of glyphs and runes, and finally a big, very complicated ritual circle.
 </p>
<p>
  "Thank you for this, Jessie," I said. "Why don't we go have some lunch, take a look at this, and talk business."
 </p>
<p>
  She nodded seriously. "I'd like that."
 </p>
