   Stepping between realms left Kaelan's bones feeling loose in her skin, reality sliding sideways before snapping back into focus like a rubber band released. But this transition was different. The crystalline walls of the angelic realm's landing hall materialized around them with their familiar ethereal glow, and she felt something in her chest unclench for the first time in weeks. Home. The air here thrummed with power, clean and electric, alive with the gathered essence of thousands of angels.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Commander's reaction couldn't have been more different. The moment they solidified, his shoulders went rigid. He stood there like a man bracing for impact rather than someone who'd just returned to sanctuary.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "How long has it been?" she asked quietly, watching him scan their surroundings with the wariness of a stranger evaluating threats.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Too long." His voice was carefully neutral, but his eyes betrayed old pain.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The landing hall stretched before them in graceful arcs of white stone that seemed lit from within, delicate spirals of gold tracing patterns across walls that rose to a vaulted ceiling open to the luminous sky. Aurora-like streams of pure essence painted the heavens in shifting hues that would have driven mortals to their knees in wonder. It was beautiful in a way that transcended mere aesthetics; it was divine artistry perfected over millennia.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Commander looked at it all like a man seeing his childhood home burned to the ground and rebuilt by strangers.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A familiar presence brushed against Kaelan's aura; warm, ancient, tinged with violet light. The psychic touch was as recognizable as a voice, carrying with it centuries of unconditional acceptance. She smiled despite their circumstances. "We're about to have company."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Commander felt it too. His entire body went rigid. "Did you tell anyone I was coming?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The edge in his voice surprised her. "No, why would I? Even if you haven't been home for a while, an
  </span>
  <em>

  <span>
   returning shouldn't-" Understanding began to dawn as she watched his face. How long had he been gone? And what had happened before he left?
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He stuffed his hands in his pockets, the casual gesture looking wrong here, too mortal and guarded for a place that should have offered safety. The massive doors swung open with silent grace, revealing a figure that made Kaelan's heart lift despite everything.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Chidara stepped into the chamber, her diminutive form draped in robes of deep red that seemed to capture starlight. Red-streaked white hair was pulled back in an intricate braid, leaving her ageless face unframed, violet eyes sweeping the hall with keen intelligence.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Those eyes found Commander, and everything changed.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Chidara stopped dead, color draining from her face. Her eyes widened, disbelief and something far more complex flickering across her features. For a moment that stretched into eternity, neither moved.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Hey," Commander said finally, the word falling into the silence like a stone into still water. Casual, but Kaelan could hear the tremor underneath.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Chidara's hands slowly clenched into fists. Her lips pressed into a thin line, and when she spoke, her voice carried the weight of centuries. "Reinin." The name was both recognition and accusation. Then she moved, crossing the space between them in three quick strides, and slapped him across the face hard enough that the sound echoed off crystal walls.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Commander barely flinched, accepting the blow like he'd been expecting it. "I suppose I deserved that."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Chidara's composure cracked. "Reinin, you jackass." More pain than anger, the sound of someone who'd carried a wound far too long.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan felt like an intruder watching something too personal, too raw for casual observation. She'd known Commander had to be old - his power and knowledge made that obvious - but she'd never considered he might have history here. Personal connections. People who'd loved him and been left behind. The pieces fell into place: his reluctance to discuss the angelic realm, her unfamiliarity with him, his seemingly permanent residence on the mortal plane.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Hey," Commander said again, but this time his voice carried something soft, a gentleness that transformed his entire bearing. He reached out cautiously and captured Chidara's wrist. "Is that any sort of welcome for an old friend?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The touch broke something in Chidara's defenses. She let him pull her into a hug, her tiny frame disappearing against his bulk. When she pulled away, her eyes were suspiciously wet.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Commander's expression had softened too, but there was something hesitant in his posture, a question he didn't seem to want to voice. When he finally spoke, it was with uncharacteristic uncertainty. "It's good to see you, Chi. I don't suppose-" He paused, searching her face with desperate hope. "Is she…"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Chidara's eyes widened slightly. She shook her head slowly, the motion seeming to pain her.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Ah." Commander's face shuttered. He took a careful step back. "I expect not."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The exchange was brief, coded in the language of old friends, but Kaelan caught the edges. Someone had been lost. Someone important enough that after all these years, Commander still carried hope for their return.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Chidara seemed to recognize that Commander needed a moment to compose himself. She turned to Kaelan instead, her expression warming as she gathered the younger angel into a fierce embrace. "Welcome home,
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    kethara
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   ," she said, using the Celestial term that meant something between beloved younger sister and precious student.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Thanks," Kaelan replied, drawing comfort from the familiar violet-tinged aura that, along with her mentor, had been one of her first guides in understanding angelic society. "I’m sorry, should I have warned you? I didn't realize-"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You couldn't have known." Chidara released her but kept one hand on her shoulder. "Reinin left us long before you crossed over. Before most of the current generation came to the realm."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She turned back to Commander, steel entering her voice. "You've been in the mortal realm all this time." Not a question. "We could feel you sometimes, like an echo at the edge of perception. But every time we tried to track the signature, to reach out..."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I learned to mask it," he admitted. "Had to. The work I was doing required absolute discretion."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The work you were doing." Her voice was flat with barely controlled anger. "And what work could possibly be more important than your duties here? Your responsibilities to the realm? To the people who-" She cut herself off, but the unfinished accusation hung heavy. She glanced around the landing hall, suddenly aware of their exposed position. "Not here." Without waiting for a response, she strode toward a side passage. "Follow me. Both of you."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Commander straightened, and Kaelan saw him slip back into the role she knew: strategic mind, careful planner, leader who could make hard choices without flinching. But underneath, she could still see the vulnerability, the guilt he carried. They followed Chidara through halls that managed to be both magnificent and homey, crystal spires rising overhead while soft light emanated from the walls themselves. Other angels they passed gave polite nods but kept their distance. Chidara's expression didn't invite interruption.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Her rooms were spacious but comfortable, more library than residence. Shelves of crystalline tablets lined the walls, their surfaces shimmering with stored knowledge. Kaelan settled into her usual chair, as did Chidara, but Commander remained standing, clearly ill at ease. "The question is," Chidara continued, violet eyes never leaving his face, "why are you here now? After all these centuries of silence, what brings the exile home?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Kaldi," Commander said simply. "Kaelan told me about her project. Her plans for the Lodestone. I came to help."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Chidara's laugh was bitter. "Help?" Her eyes snapped with anger and he actually seemed to shrink. "You, who walked away from every responsibility, every duty, everyone who depended on you? You want to help now?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The accusation hit home. Kaelan could see it in the way Commander's shoulders sagged, the way his hands clenched into fists inside his pockets. The burden of years of guilt and regret settled over him. "I know how this looks-"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Do you?" Chidara leaned forward, her small frame radiating fury that made the air crackle with suppressed power. "Do you have any idea what your disappearance did to morale? To the war effort? To the people who loved you?" Her voice broke slightly on the last words, revealing the personal wound beneath the professional outrage.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Chi..." Commander's voice was soft, pleading. The shortened name carried decades of intimacy, shared history Kaelan could only guess at.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Don't." Chidara held up a hand, cutting him off with absolute authority. "Don't you dare. Not after what you put us through. Not after what you put
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    me
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   through."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan felt like she was witnessing something she had no right to see, but she couldn't look away. This was a side of Commander she'd never suspected; vulnerable, guilt-ridden, haunted by choices that had clearly cost him everything he'd once held dear. The man who'd seemed so unshakeable revealed as someone who'd made an impossible choice and been living with the consequences ever since.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It wasn't like that," Commander said finally, his voice heavy with exhaustion that seemed to come from his very soul. "The work I was doing, the people I was protecting... they needed me. The realm had hundreds of angels, thousands. They had no one."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Pretty words," Chidara said, but there was more pain than anger now. "But we both know the real reason you left. The thing you've never been able to admit, even to yourself."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Commander went very still. Kaelan saw something like fear flicker across his features. "Chi, don't."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Revelation," Chidara said, the word carrying the weight of sacred ritual. "Your third-tier advancement. You saw something in that vision, didn't you? Something that changed everything."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan shivered at the mention. She knew her own Revelation lay somewhere in the future, but like the First Kill, it was something older angels refused to discuss in detail. The mystery of it, the obvious weight it carried for those who'd experienced it, had always unsettled her.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What did you see?" Chidara pressed, her voice dropping to barely above a whisper. "What was so terrible that it made you abandon your duty, your realm, your-"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She stopped herself, but the unfinished word hung between them.
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    Your family.
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   That's what she'd been about to say. Whatever had existed between these two had been deeper than friendship, more binding than mere duty.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Commander slowly removed his sunglasses, revealing eyes that held depths of pain Kaelan had never suspected. In the ethereal light of the angelic realm, she could see the weight he carried, the burden of knowledge that had driven him from everything he'd once held sacred. "I saw the truth," he said simply, but his voice carried the gravity of absolute conviction. "About what we really are. What this war really costs. What we're really fighting for."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "And you decided we weren't worth it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I decided the mortals were worth more than we'd given them credit for." Steel entered his voice now, the bedrock certainty that had driven him through centuries of exile. "They're not pieces on a cosmic game board, Chi. They're people. We forget that sometimes. Real people with hopes and dreams and families they'd die to protect. They build beautiful things and love fiercely and show stunning ingenuity in the face of the destruction we caused them. And we've been treating them like... like livestock to be managed."

 <p>
  <span>
   "They're under our protection-"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "They're under our management," Commander cut her off, his voice growing harder. "There's a difference. A big one. We make decisions about their lives, their futures, their right to exist, and we never ask what they want. We never consider that they might have a say in their own fate."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Chidara's face went carefully blank, but Kaelan could see the argument building behind her eyes. Before she could voice it, Commander continued, his expression growing sardonic. "But that wasn't the only reason I left, was it, Chi? You know what the council really thought of the Angel of Demons."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <span>
    Angel of Demons.
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   Kaelan felt pieces clicking into place. She'd known Commander was old, powerful, but this... this explained so much. His understanding of demonic psychology, his sympathy for half-breeds, his complex relationship with the entire conflict.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Reinin..."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "No, she should understand who...
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    what
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   she's working with." Bitterness crept into his tone. "The council saw a half-breed angel as a flaw, not a gift. A corruption to be tolerated rather than wisdom to be valued."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "They didn't trust your perspective," Kaelan said quietly, understanding flooding through her. If they could drive away someone like Commander, someone whose very nature made him invaluable to understanding their enemies, what other wisdom had they discarded? What other voices had been silenced in service to rigid doctrine? She'd spent centuries believing in the absolute righteousness of their cause, the perfect wisdom of their leadership. But watching Commander's pain, seeing the regret in Chidara's eyes, she began to understand that the angelic realm was as flawed and political as any mortal institution. Perhaps more so, because they had eternity to nurse their grudges and calcify their mistakes.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Exactly." Commander's smile was sharp and humorless. "Every strategic recommendation questioned. Every insight dismissed as 'demon sympathy.' Every time I suggested that maybe we were being too rigid, too absolute in our thinking, I was reminded that my perspective was... compromised."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   His hands clenched into fists. Kaelan could see the old frustration, centuries of being dismissed and marginalized, burning in his eyes. "They feared what you represented," she said.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Change. The possibility that their perfect, ordered system might be wrong. That their righteous crusade might be built on foundations of sand." He turned back to Chidara, his voice softening with old pain. "How many angels have been lost because the council refused to adapt? How many opportunities for peace were squandered because tradition mattered more than truth?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The questions hung between them, unanswered and unanswerable. Chidara's expression had shifted from anger to something more complex, a mix of understanding and lingering hurt that spoke to old arguments, old wounds that had never properly healed. "So you left," she said finally, her voice heavy with exhaustion. "You saw a truth that the council couldn't accept, and you walked away from everything rather than fight for it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I left because I realized I could do more good as one man helping people than as one angel enforcing a divine will I no longer believed in." His voice carried quiet conviction. "The realm would survive without me. It had to. But the mortals I was protecting... they wouldn't survive without someone willing to stand between them and the forces that would use them as pawns."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The admission hung in the air between them, heavy with centuries of separation and regret. Kaelan found herself seeing Commander - Reinin - in an entirely new light. Not just a powerful, mysterious leader, but a man who'd sacrificed everything he'd ever known for a principle, for a truth that had cost him his home, his family, his very identity.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "And now?" Chidara asked, barely above a whisper. "What's changed?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Kaldi," Commander said simply, but the name carried the weight of absolute finality. "What she's planning... it won't just affect the mortals. It'll tear apart the foundations of reality itself. We've both seen what happens when angels try to reshape the cosmic order according to their personal vision. It doesn't end well for anyone."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Chidara was quiet for a long moment, studying his face with the intensity of someone trying to read a text written in a half-forgotten language. Finally, she sighed. When she spoke, her voice carried fond exasperation that spoke to decades of shared history. "You always were too idealistic for your own good. Even as a novice, you wanted to save everyone. You couldn't stand the thought of acceptable losses."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "And you always were too pragmatic for yours," Commander replied, but there was genuine affection in his voice now, warmth that had been absent since their reunion began. "Remember the Meridian Campaign? You wanted to evacuate the mortal settlements before we engaged the demon forces. I insisted we could hold the line and protect them."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You nearly got yourself killed trying." Her tone had warmed as well, the frost of old anger beginning to thaw. "Three broken ribs and a punctured lung because you wouldn't leave that family behind when the demon lord targeted their building specifically."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "But we saved them." For a moment, Kaelan could see the angel he had been: young, idealistic, determined to prove there was always another way. "All of them. Every last person in that settlement."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "This time it might not be that simple." There was less hostility in Chidara's voice now, more of the careful consideration of a strategic mind engaging with a familiar problem. "Kaldi has support from nearly half the council. She's convinced them that the Lodestone is the key to ending the eternal war."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "By destroying the mortal realm," Kaelan interjected, unable to keep the horror from her voice. "That's not ending the war, that's genocide on a scale that's barely comprehensible."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "From her perspective, it's surgical removal of the problem." Chidara moved to a cabinet carved from what appeared to be a single piece of luminous crystal. She withdrew an ornate bottle filled with liquid that sparkled like captured starlight, along with three delicate glasses that seemed too fragile for mortal hands. "No more mortals means no more temptation for demons to corrupt, no more battleground for our conflicts. Clean, efficient, final."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She poured the drinks with practiced grace. Kaelan recognized the ritual; a formal sharing of
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    etherin
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   , the ceremonial wine of the angelic realm. To share it was to acknowledge equal standing, to accept the bonds of trust and mutual obligation.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It's a logically appealing solution," Chidara continued, offering glasses to both of them. "Especially to angels who've grown tired of the endless fighting, who see mortals as more trouble than they're worth."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Monstrous," Commander said flatly, accepting his glass but not drinking. "Logical, perhaps, but monstrous nonetheless."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Perhaps. But logic has its own appeal, especially when wrapped in righteousness and the promise of eternal peace." Chidara settled back into her chair, movements graceful despite the obvious weight of the conversation. "She's not wrong about the war, Reinin. It's been... difficult since you left. The demons have grown bolder, more organized. We've lost ground we held for millennia."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "All the more reason to find a better solution. There's always another way, Chi. There has to be."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You should know that Kaldi isn't the idealistic young angel you might remember. Her Revelation changed her, hardened her in ways that go beyond mere philosophy. She sees opposition as obstacles to be removed, not opinions to be considered."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What exactly did she see?" Commander asked, genuine curiosity mixed with concern. "In her Revelation?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Chidara met his eyes, her expression troubled. "Something that convinced her the universe was ending. A great darkness consuming everything. Not death or destruction, but nothingness itself. A wave of absolute void that devoured light, matter, energy, thought. She claims it showed her the death of everything. Angels, demons, mortals, even the divine realms themselves."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Commander had gone very still. "And she believes the Lodestone is the only way to prevent this?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "She believes that by eliminating the mortal realm, by ending the eternal conflict, the remaining forces can unite against this coming darkness." Chidara's voice was carefully neutral, but Kaelan could hear the doubt underneath. "Unite under her guidance, of course."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "And the council believes this vision?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Some do. Others think her Revelation was corrupted somehow, that the strain of advancing to third tier damaged her mind rather than enlightening it." Chidara's expression was diplomatic, but her meaning was clear. "Revelations aren't always literal truth. Sometimes they're metaphor, warning, possibility rather than certainty."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "But she believes it's real."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Absolutely. With the fervor of a true believer." Chidara sipped from her glass contemplatively. "And that certainty is what makes her so dangerous. She's convinced she's saving the universe. How do you argue with an Angel of Destiny who believes they're preventing another apocalypse?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Commander was quiet for a long moment, staring out the window at the realm he'd abandoned centuries ago. When he finally spoke, his voice carried quiet conviction.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You find another way. There's always another way, Chi. Even when it seems impossible, even when everyone tells you to accept the unacceptable. There's always another path if you're willing to look for it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "And if there isn't?" Chidara challenged, but there was no real bite in it. "If her vision is true? If this darkness is really coming?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Then we cross that bridge when we come to it." He turned back to face them both. "But I won't condemn an entire realm based on one angel's nightmare. I won't sacrifice millions of innocent lives for the sake of a maybe."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "There are many of us who feel the same way."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Good. What does she need to activate the Lodestone? Specifically?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Essence," Chidara replied, settling back in her chair. "From every angel in the realm. The unlocking ritual requires universal participation. It has to be freely given, supposedly, but..." She shrugged eloquently, the gesture conveying volumes about Kaldi's interpretation of "freely given."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "But Kaldi's definition of 'freely given' has become rather flexible," Commander guessed, his tone grim.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You always were quick." A smile that held more sadness than humor. "Yes. She's been applying pressure. Subtle at first… administrative difficulties, unfavorable assignments, social ostracization. But it's grown more direct as her timeline has compressed. Angels who refuse to contribute find themselves facing disciplinary action, loss of status, assignment to duties that are... unpleasant. Patrols in the void zones, guard duty at the reality anchors, deep reconnaissance into actively hostile demonic territory."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "And those who openly oppose her?" Commander's voice had gone very quiet, the tone he used when preparing for violence.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Disappear," Kaelan said grimly, the memory of her own narrow escape still fresh. "I barely got out before she could add me to her collection."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Commander's expression darkened. For a moment, Kaelan caught a glimpse of something truly dangerous beneath his controlled exterior. When he spoke, his voice carried the promise of retribution. "She's forcing angels to contribute essence through torture."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   It wasn't a question, and Chidara's silence was answer enough.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What's the timeline?" His tactical mind was clearly engaging despite his obvious anger. "How close is she to having what she needs?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Close," Chidara admitted, swirling the sparkling liquid in her glass without drinking. "It's hard to say exactly. She's been secretive about her progress, compartmentalizing the information even among her supporters. But based on the number of angels who've gone missing, the resources she's been requisitioning..."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Soon," Commander concluded grimly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Sooner than we’d like."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Commander stood abruptly, beginning to pace the length of the chamber with the restless energy of a caged predator. Kaelan recognized the signs. His tactical mind was fully engaged now, processing information, calculating variables. "Who still opposes her openly?" he asked without stopping his movement.
  </span>
 </p>

   "Fewer than before." Chidara's voice was heavy with the weight of too many losses. "Vaethir holds out, and many of the scribes follow their lead. Some of the older angels remember what the realm was like before the war began, when cooperation and balance were valued over absolute victory." She paused, taking a small sip before continuing. "But Kaldi has what you might call the fear vote; angels who believe in her vision of darkness, or those who have simply grown tired of spending their existence guarding and shepherding mortals."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Can you get us to the council chambers?" Commander asked suddenly, stopping his pacing to fix Chidara with an intense stare. "If I could address them directly, remind them of what we're supposed to stand for..."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Absolutely not." Chidara set down her glass with enough force to make it ring against the crystal table. "The moment you reveal yourself, you become a target. Kaldi isn't stupid, Reinin. She knows exactly how dangerous you could be to her plans."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Then what do you suggest?" A note of frustration Kaelan had rarely heard from him.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Chidara was quiet for a moment, swirling the liquid in her glass as she considered. When she spoke, her voice carried the careful calculation of someone walking through a minefield. "There might be another way. The Lodestone requires unanimous consent to activate safely. The ritual mathematics are extremely complex, and even a small deviation from the required parameters could have... unpredictable results."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It becomes unstable," Commander finished, understanding dawning in his expression. "Dangerous to use."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Exactly. If even one angel withholds their essence, the entire structure becomes compromised." Chidara leaned forward, her violet eyes bright with possibility. "The question is whether we can keep enough angels on our side to prevent her from reaching the unanimity she needs."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "How many is enough?" Kaelan asked, leaning forward as well.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Hard to say precisely. The ritual mathematics are among the most complex theoretical frameworks in existence. But based on what I remember from the old texts, even a handful of holdouts might be sufficient to prevent safe activation."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "And if she tries to activate it anyway?" Commander asked.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Chidara's expression went grim. "Then we all pray that the resulting disaster destroys only her and her supporters, rather than taking the entire realm with it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The implications hung in the air. Commander resumed his pacing, but now there was purpose in his movement, the focused energy of someone building toward a decision. "This could work," he said finally. "But we'll need more than just holdouts. We'll need active resistance, coordinated opposition. People willing to fight for the principle rather than just passively resist."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You're talking about open civil war," Chidara said quietly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I'm talking about preventing genocide." His voice carried absolute conviction. "Kaldi has already chosen war, Chi. The only question is whether we're going to fight back or let her win by default."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Chidara stood as well, moving to the chamber's great window that looked out over the spires and bridges of the angelic realm's capital. In the distance, Kaelan could see other angels moving about their business, unaware of the conversation that might determine their fate.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   When she spoke, her voice was soft but determined. "Then we fight."
  </span>
