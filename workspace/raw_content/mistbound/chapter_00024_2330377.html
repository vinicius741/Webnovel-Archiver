<p class="cnM3NTZhYmM5NTY1MDQzMDliZWJiOTFmMzE2ODI2NTNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn allowed Ernesto to take the lead as they began hiking up the mountain, carefully watching her surroundings. There wasn’t any Mist here, but that had been easily explained by the presence of mana barrier rods placed around the airfield and extending up the first switchback of the trail. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3MTE4ODA2M2FjMzRjN2JiYjRiMTQzZmMyYWVkZTVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so, Maeryn felt on edge. Being on the surface left her uneasy - a product of her training and years as a hunter. It certainly didn’t help that they were on unfamiliar ground, and that she didn’t have a reliable spotter to keep an eye for skyward threats. The lack of any noise beyond the crunch of dirt and pebbles and stray leaves as they continued to walk up the trail was also vaguely disquieting. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhZjFlNDE4MzU3YjQzZjNhNmNhM2QyOWE3ZGYwZTg2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn blinked as she registered the silence. It was an oppressive one - she’d never, ever been on the surface before without some kind of sound in nature. The chirping of birds, the humming of insects, the rustling of wind, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">something</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. But there was none of that here. Even the air was unnaturally still, and… getting faintly colder with every step they took. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiY2FmMDE2N2ExZDQ4YzViZDJlM2M0Y2E2N2Y0MDk3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn did not like that, not one bit. But there was nothing she could do about it now, besides staying on high alert. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0MmE2NDkwNDEzNDQ2Zjc5ZjM5MjcxNTY1YzJmYTM0"><span style="font-weight: 400">At least the sensation of climbing the slope wasn’t entirely unfamiliar; there were plenty of tunnels and caverns in Geova where you had to ascend or descend to get where you needed. She found some comfort in the rhythm of the hike, even though her nerves refused to settle fully with how exposed they were. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0OTM5ZDkxMmJmNTQ3ODVhMmI5MjVhMDAxODZiMTI5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn glanced up at the mountain, trying to gauge how long it would take to reach the top by foot. Several hours, assuming they didn’t stop to rest, she estimated. “How far up the mountain is your master?” she questioned. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjNjhlZjRlZWQ1NjQ1MzM4MTllM2ZjMjk0NzFiN2Vl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Could be… almost anywhere…” Ernesto admitted breathlessly. Maeryn repressed a sigh. There was no way they’d be able to go without breaks if the research assistant was this out of shape. “But Master… likes to stay close to his airship. So… he’s probably… in the first two or three of the graveyards. Otherwise he would have parked on top.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM1MmZmYmQzMjI0MDQ3ZTBiNjI0YTlmNjY4Mzk5YTYy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, that was a pleasant surprise. Maeryn rapidly revised her estimate. An hour or two. That wasn’t too bad. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxYjM0NjQwOTE1MzQ3YWI5ZGNlNzJmMTdiNjkzOGUw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s… where most of the dead… get buried, anyway,” Ernesto continued, sucking wind as he pushed himself onwards, oblivious to the effect his words were having on the hunter. “Master… has theories… about the effects of old graves against new graves. He’s been… studying them for years.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjMjkzNTBiMWI4MjRmNGM4NWY4YTFhNTFhMWVlNmE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn’s eye twitched as she digested that information. She really could have gone without ever learning that. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZjgyZWVjZjBkYzQyYzlhNjNkZGM0ZmU1ODU4MDY4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan walked closer to her, leaning in to mutter conspiratorially. “I can’t tell if Ernesto legitimately doesn’t think Graves is a necromancer, or if he’s actually that oblivious… or if he just doesn’t care.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzZjk3YTY4MmQwYjRmNWZhNWExYTQ0NTA3ODNkMjZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have no idea either,” Maeryn replied under her breath. “But I don’t think Graves could be more obvious if he tried.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmOTg4NDliZWYxMDQ0MjE5NTdlNDY4MzE0NDZkOTg2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, he could have an Undead honor guard? I’m sure that would make it pretty obvious.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMxZTNhYmNhM2YwMjQ4ODlhYTBlMjQxNzE2NDc0NDY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn had to mask her sudden giggle as a random cough, and Dan chuckled lightly as he pulled away. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxZjAzNDE1NzU2YjQ4ODg5ZGMwZjkxZmQzYmM3MmQw"><span style="font-weight: 400">They continued up the trail in relative silence after that, and Maeryn had to admit that Ernesto was determined if nothing else. She could tell even from her position several steps behind that he was sweating profusely from physical exertion, but he made no indications of stopping, only drinking from a hip flask every now and then. She was reluctantly impressed. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhMWE3ODVjMWYwYzQzYWI5NTUzM2JiOWExZjFhOWIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">They finally reached the first graveyard, and Maeryn looked around. It was a simple-looking place, with headstones neatly lined in rows and columns, names and dates etched into them. Each headstone was identical in shape, a simple gray rectangular block. There was something… vaguely unsettling, about them though. After a long moment’s consideration, Maeryn realized it: every headstone was clean. Perfectly clean. Not a scrap of moss, no signs of wind damage, no wear and tear at all. For as far as she could see, every single headstone was in perfect condition, looking almost brand new.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhY2VjYWUzNzRhNTQ0ZmViMWE1YzEyMjEwZDc3MGFi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Not only that, but the plot itself looked… completely uniform. Not a spec of grass out of place. No variation of life at all, no weeds, nothing. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwMWRhZDZlOWZmNTQyMDNiZWQzNjc5MmM2M2QxNDc1"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a perfect, too-perfect graveyard. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0OTBkYzZlMmZkOTQzNGI4Mjc4ZTgwNGI3OWZhZDY3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn shivered. Very little of it was from the chill that permeated the air now. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjNTkxM2FjNGY5ZTRkYjBhZGViZmE4ZTk1NmU0MjEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s unsettling, isn’t it?” Ernesto asked quietly, knowingly. “The first time Master took me here is when I understood that there was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">something </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">about graveyards. That the dead still had an effect on the mana and air of a place. Why is it that our bodies instinctively know this, but we have so much trouble measuring it…?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNkMWUyZDJmNTE3ZDQ1MThiMmZiYjY5MzQ0OGE0Njlk"><span style="font-weight: 400">The flesh on Maeryn’s neck prickled at his words, and she watched Ernesto intensely, but the assistant seemed lost in thought, reflecting on his memories perhaps. Coming out of his trance with a shake of his head, Ernesto sighed. “Master’s not here. Onwards, I suppose.” He began walking up the trail again, and Maeryn followed cautiously, Dan right next to her.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMmE1M2M1NTM4OTRhYWU4ZmU0YWU4YjRlN2NlMGFm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I did not take Ernesto to be spooky,” Dan admitted under his breath. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3NmQ0N2U0ZmEzMDQ1YmRiYWE5Mzk2MTNhMjBiY2Uy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Me neither,” Maeryn agreed just as quietly. “I guess he and Graves are more suited for each other than I thought.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3OTU4ZWVmZmFkNjQxYjFiMGYyYzFhMzRmNTJkZDFi"><span style="font-weight: 400">They walked without saying anything more, and eventually they hit the point of the trail where it switched back to go up the mountain in the other direction. But there was a second graveyard at the switchback point, looking similar to the first one. Eerily similar, in fact. If it weren’t for the fact that there was a singularly large willow tree with a bench in the middle of this one, Maeryn would have been hard pressed to say that it wasn’t the same graveyard. It had the same dimensions, the same shapes, the same number of rows and columns, the same unnatural uniformity, the same impossible perfection in the maintenance of the headstones… </span></p><span class="cjY4MWUzN2UwMTBjYTQwYTg5NzNkMmJkMzYxY2Y0ZjJi"><br/>This story is posted elsewhere by the author.

<p class="cnM0NTZjZmYzOTA1NDQzY2VhMTEyNWU4ZjVhYjIyODc5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn did not like this place. Not at all. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0YmEyOTkyNTA3ZDRkZDg5M2ZjMmZlMzZlM2FjMTRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto walked up to the large tree and looked around, his face some mixture of reverence and anxiety. “Master Graves often takes breaks here,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper. “He says the tree helps him think.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNzBkZTFlNzFlODQyZTFhYjFjZjQ1MTI1ZDJiYWQz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn glanced around, the uniformity of the graveyard gnawing at her nerves. “This place gives me the creeps,” she admitted. “Why does it look almost exactly the same as the first graveyard?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYWQwZDUwZjMxMjQ3ZmQ4OGI0ZGQxNTg1MTlmNWRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Surprisingly, it was Dan who answered. “His research,” he stated confidently, keeping his voice low. “The fewer differences there are between things, the easier it is to identify correlations and relationships. I think… I think the tree here was an experiment on what happens to the mana if there was a tree nourished by the corpses of the dead.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwNTJjN2I0ZWQ3ZDQyOWNhYmI5MGIwZTBlMTIxY2M4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto’s eyebrows shot up. “That’s exactly it,” he admitted. “You have some amazing intuition, Master Dan. I think you and Master would get along splendidly.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjOGE5M2Y1N2E1MDQ2Yzc4MDJjZDcwMGMyZmE0MGIx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan looked rather unsettled at the praise. He didn’t reply, choosing instead to look at the apparently quite healthy tree for a long moment before turning away. “Master Graves isn’t here. We should keep moving.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyYTljODRjMDVmNjQ3NWY4NzQ0NjY1YWU2ZGNiNTZl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto nodded, and the three of them continued up the trail. Maeryn felt the air grow even colder - which was to be expected, climbing a mountain - but it was an unwelcome addition to the oppressive atmosphere that lingered over them like a fog that refused to be dispersed by the sun. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjA4NmU0M2IwMTQxOGQ4NDQxODUyOTc5OTg5YzI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn cast her senses out as far as she could, listening intently, breathing deeply, looking as far as she could in every direction. There was nothing. No sounds, no scents, no flashes of movement out of the corners of her eye, nothing. No other creatures that she could detect at all. No birdsong, no insects, nothing, which was disturbing in itself. And yet she could not shake the feeling that they were not alone. That she was being watched. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2MzI4MTMxOThhOTQyODc4ZDg1MWE4ODU1ZWNlMzFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no logic to it. No reason. Just her body’s instinct. Maeryn wanted to leave, she wanted to go back to her airship this instant and put this creepy Depths-forsaken mountain behind her. But… they needed Research Master Graves. So she continued on, following Ernesto. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2Y2QxYTEyMDU4ZjRhY2JhNzMzMDJiNjk2NDBiYjk2"><span style="font-weight: 400">They reached the third graveyard. It was once again identical to the first, save for one difference: there was an obelisk in the center of the graveyard, engraved with a message that couldn’t be read easily from the entrance. Maeryn moved to read it, but Ernesto spoke before she took more than a step or two. “The obelisk reads ‘Those who have been put to rest here, rejoice. Be not bound to the shells you bore in life, for your spirits are free.’” The assistant stepped forward, placing a hand on the obelisk in wonder. “Can you not feel the difference in the air? Mere words on stone, a message to those passed… and yet the air feels lighter, does it not? The dead here… are they kinder to us who have yet to join them, because we wished them well first? I wish to know…” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiYzhiM2I5NWIzNDQ4MTA4ZDdlYjFmZGZkNjJkODBk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn felt a shiver at Ernesto’s words, her unease mingling with a reluctant curiosity. She could sense the subtle change in the air, but it did little to ease the growing apprehension. “I… don’t see Research Master Graves? I thought you said he’d be in the first few graveyards?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0Y2I3ZGQzYjA5MDRhMzVhMWY1MWQyZTY4MDk2M2Qw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto blinked, coming out of whatever pensive trance he’d been in. “He, um, he should’ve been here,” he admitted. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZjlkMTc0NjgzNDRiNmI5OWU5NGFmMTI5MDY0NDE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m right here.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjOGIwNmFlYjRjYTRiYWRhZjcxMzVjMTNlMzZkZTBl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn jumped about a foot in the air, completely startled. The voice had come from only a few feet behind her. That should’ve been impossible! The sound of footsteps on the pebbles and rocks and dirt of the path was unmistakable! And yet…! </span></p>
<p class="cnNiN2YzNWRjMGI3MTRkNDI4M2ViODE5YzdmNTM1OWNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Whirling on the voice, her heart racing, Maeryn came face to face with none other than Research Master Graves. He was an older man with gentle features and a soft smile, well-cared for silver hair tied back into a ponytail, and a dark, warm-looking long coat that reached his ankles. Honestly, he looked incredibly nonthreatening, and Maeryn felt abruptly embarrassed that she’d harbored so many suspicions about the man without even meeting him. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiNGJhZTJlOTM5YTQ5Zjk4ZWVlNmU5YmU1YzU0OGQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ernesto… I’m glad to see you, my student,” Graves called out with a smile. “Along with your new friends. Come, come, it is cold out here. Let us go inside where it is warm. There is a cave system just a little further up the path where I have been staying.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTc2YWYyOTdhYTQ1MjhiMmY2ZWI0Nzk1ZDVkMjA2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn and Dan exchanged glances, then nodded. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiMGU0ZTI0ZjVmZTQwNmRhNDkxYzU5OTdiYmE2MDZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Master! I was so worried about you!” Ernesto exclaimed. “You’ve been gone so long!” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzMTg1NzhmYmJlMzRlN2Y5MjQ4Zjg0NzM1ODczZDM5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“All will be explained when we get there,” Graves assured him gently. “I am sorry for worrying you, child. Now, come along.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMxNzczN2YzOTQ2OTRlMTI4NDU0YzExNDk2ZDRiYmMy"><span style="font-weight: 400">The four of them continued up the trail, and sure enough, within minutes there was an open door into the mountain on their left. They walked inside, though Graves seemed to avoid even accidentally brushing up against any of them. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZWQxOTk5NzZlMTQzZjA5MmZlOTJkYTU0OWE3OTM4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut the door, Ernesto, and keep the warmth inside.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzMjNhMDM0YTY2ZTRhNTk5ODZiODUxNDQ0NTE5OTVh"><span style="font-weight: 400">The assistant quickly did as he was bid, and Maeryn looked around. They had entered a rather comfortable-looking study. A desk cluttered with papers and an oil lamp stood prominently, while bookshelves lined the walls. Glowmoss on the ceiling provided a soft, familiar light that contrasted sharply with the cold outside. A plush chair sat invitingly near the desk, and a simple bed lay in the corner, adding an element of homeliness to the space.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwY2M5NWI1MDk2MzQwN2U4Y2JhYzc1NzNkMGU0YmFi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite the warmth and comfort of the study, Maeryn’s senses remained on high alert. Her gaze shifted to the door at the back of the chamber, leading further into the cave system. There was something about Graves that unsettled her, even now in this seemingly benign environment. Why was she so uneasy? </span></p>
<p class="cnMxZDBmZWRlYzIyMDQyOTNhYWUwNmFhN2MwMTdmMjhl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sir? Where is it?” Ernesto asked, sounding a little unsettled himself. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiY2QyNGE1MTlhNTQ1YjFhMjcwNjRjNzk5ZjA4Yzdl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where is what, Ernesto?” Graves asked kindly, though the sad smile on his face gave away that he already knew the answer. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDU4NmU3OWE1ODQ1MjY4ZTYxNzJhNTliYmFmNzFh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your life’s work, Master. Your Compendium. I… I don’t see it anywhere! I’ve never seen you without it!” </span></p>
<p class="cnMxOGI5YTgxZTJmNTQ3ZjI4YjJkMjQxYzhiMzFjNzAx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah.” Graves sighed. “I’d hoped it would take you longer to notice… but I suppose that is my own fault. You’ve always been an exceptionally observant student.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZjFlMzQ1OTcwMTRlNGFhYzBmZmI2MDY5ZTUyMGE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sir! I… I’m flattered, but…!” Ernesto seemed lost for words, but his distress was obvious. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlYzVmZWQyMjY4ODRjZTZhOGMyYjNiNDZkZWMyMjVh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“All will be answered, I promise,” Graves told him gently. “My Compendium is back there, in the last room.” He gestured towards the door at the back of the chamber. “There is a creature back there that must be put down in order to retrieve it. I lack the strength to do it myself… and so do you, at the moment. But you…” Graves turned to Maeryn appraisingly, his eyes lingering for just a moment too long on each of her arms… where her vambraces were hidden beneath her jacket. Gooseflesh crept up her arms, completely unrelated to the cold. “I think you could do it. Will you be so kind as to fetch my Compendium?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhMWUwOTgxMTQ5MTQzNTA4Y2QxNDdmMTE4ZWFhZjhk"><span style="font-weight: 400">A horrible, chilling suspicion was starting to settle into Maeryn’s bones. If her fears were correct… “I will,” she said quietly despite the rising dread in her stomach. “I’ll be right back.” </span></p>
