<span>
   “Um…” It had been a while since Maeryn was truly lost for words, and it certainly didn’t help that Robert Hawks had set a very brisk pace as they walked through the streets towards the royal palace. “Thank you, Robert. Or, do you prefer Hawks, or…?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Robert’s fine,” the old man confirmed easily. “And of course. My generation’s got to do its part to make sure yours has a chance to grow old. And since you clearly got dealt a rotten hand… well, how could I not lend some assistance?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “We really appreciate it,” Maeryn assured him, feeling somehow both reassured and patronized.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Besides, I’m pretty sure the princess thinks I’m just a funny uncle at this point,” Robert continued easily. “Between you and me, the king seems to have taken a liking to me and keeps inviting me over to tea. No idea why.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn exchanged another glance with Terrance. “Um, maybe it’s because you keep using the broach? Anna did say this was your fourth time…”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Fifth, actually,” Robert corrected casually. “I wore it once before Anna joined the Council, but I just can’t bring myself to correct her. Feels like bragging.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Uh-huh. And you don’t think that maybe the fact that you keep using it might lead the king to want to get to know you better?” Terrance asked pointedly.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Eh, maybe. I like to think that he likes my opinions and stories, though. You get to be my age, you pick up a few things. So tell me, how did a Geovan end up an airship captain?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn tripped over her own foot, barely catching herself. She shot a quick, embarrassed glance at Terrance before looking back at Robert. “What? How…?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “How’d I know?” Robert cackled, the sound full of both mirth and mischief. “You think I don’t recognize Geovan hunter equipment? Girl, I probably babysat your Elders back in the day.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Well, if that didn’t leave Maeryn feeling more exposed than ever.  “It’s a long story, sir…”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Bah! None of that sir business. Keep calling me Robert.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn swallowed, feeling distinctly out of her depth. “Right. Well, I guess it all began about eight years ago, when I was eavesdropping on my Elders…” She gave an abbreviated summary of her past, detailing how she’d spent years listening in on their meetings, learning all the things they were trying to deal with the problem, only to come across failure after failure. And all the while, the estimated timeline to Critical Mana Depletion kept shrinking.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   She went on to explain how she’d become a hunter, recruited Dan and Frankie, and how they’d repaired Stonewing
  </span>
<em>
<span>
</span>
</em>
<span>
   and left when it became clear that there was only a year or so left. “And, well, both Dan and Frankie agreed I was Captain. So I bought the uniform in Cloudreach, and… well, that’s how that happened.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Robert hummed thoughtfully. “You’re a brave kid, you know that? Takes a lot of guts to leave home like that, knowing you might not ever come back. I’m sorry that all the adults in your life made you feel like you had no choice, though. I mean, it’s not like we weren’t trying to fix the problem, but… yeah, what you went through wasn’t fair. And it sounds like a good portion of that unfairness can be laid at the ZRC’s feet, huh.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn stared at him, a swarm of emotions buzzing within her. She hadn’t expected validation from him, and it was honestly a little touching. Even if it also came with a side of being treated like a kid. She didn’t quite know how to feel about that. “Well. Yeah. It’s not fair, but that’s life, right? I think we did pretty well for ourselves.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Robert looked down at her, a strange look in his eye. “Your story didn’t end in Cloudreach when you bought that uniform,” he observed idly. “You said that you wanted Dan for his alchemy and mana research skills, that you were sure he could figure out the Mist. Did he ever?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn was just about to give a proud affirmative when she realized what she was doing, and she bit her tongue. But it was too late; Robert noticed.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “So you did. Fascinating. I bet you have a plan on how to deal with it too. But… the fact you don’t want to talk about it… on some people, I would believe they just wanted to keep the knowledge proprietary, make themselves rich with the discovery. But you? No… you’re keeping it a secret to keep someone safe, aren’t you?” Robert asked knowingly.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn’s heart skipped a beat. She looked at Robert, her throat tightening as she tried to maintain her composure. Did Robert know some kind of mind-reading magic? “Yes,” she croaked uneasily.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Fair enough,” Robert said with a shrug, his voice light and airy. “Then I won’t ask further. Not now, anyway. Maybe if we get a little closer to doomsday.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn looked at Terrance helplessly. “Are you sure
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    he’s
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   not the current Nightingale?” she hissed quietly. “He just seems to know everything!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance could only shrug. “Who knows?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Speaking of Nightingales,” Robert interjected smoothly, “You don’t need to worry about any of the Council spreading your heritage, Terrance. I can only imagine that the king will be quite put out if anything happens to you, and nobody wants on that man’s bad side.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Seriously, how do you know all this?” Terrance demanded, his frustration evident.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I’m old, and I listen,” Robert replied with a grin. “Really, that’s all there is to it.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Neither Maeryn nor Terrance had any idea what to say to that, and they fell quiet, focusing their efforts on keeping up with the surprisingly spry old man.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   It took most of an hour to get to the front gate, and the guards looked completely unsurprised to see them. “Hey, Robert. Is it tea-time already? And who’re the kids?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Afraid I’m here on official business today, boys.” The council member flashed his broach. “And the kids are with me.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The guards immediately straightened up. “Oh. Right, then. You know where to go. Um… good luck. I hope you don’t die, sir.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “What have I told you about calling me sir?” Robert grouched, walking past them and shaking his head ruefully. “Come on, kids.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   It took everything Maeryn had not to protest that she wasn’t a kid, but she managed to hold her tongue. Robert was so old that grown people with families were probably kids to him, she told herself. It wasn’t a diminishment of her or her accomplishments. Just him being him.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   It still rankled a little, though.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   They walked right through the front doors and, after Robert once again flashed his shiny broach at a well-dressed official, were brought to a waiting room. “Right then. I’m going to assume neither of you have any etiquette training, so here’s the basics,” Robert said casually, but with an underlying seriousness. “Speak only when you’re spoken to, end your sentences respectfully, and absolutely do not swear or curse. Stick to the facts. They have an enchantment in there that reacts to falsehoods, and you really don’t want to be caught lying. Not even little white lies. Got it?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn’s throat went dry. That wasn’t good; half the story about the Parlor giving Terrance a report before he died was a lie. How were they going to spin that? “Got it,” she whispered, sneaking a side glance at Terrance.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The rogue looked completely unbothered as he gave a confident nod. He met her gaze, and mouthed “Trust me.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn swallowed heavily, and gave him a shaky nod.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   They waited for a scant few minutes more, and then the doors opened. Someone - Maeryn couldn’t see who or where - called out, “Representative of the Council of Winds, Robert Hawks and companions!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “That’s our cue. Come on.” Robert walked briskly inside, holding his head up high. Maeryn and Terrance flanked him, keeping a step behind.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The king and queen, from Maeryn’s perspective, looked about how she expected. Dressed in blue and purple finery, the king had his blond hair cut short, and his shockingly blue eyes looked sharp and attentive as he sat on his throne. The queen next to him, garbed in a sky-blue dress that glittered slightly in the light, was similarly sharp-eyed, with her auburn hair elegantly arranged to flatter her face before flowing down her back.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Robert,” the king greeted, a smile playing at his lips. “Please tell me you didn’t manufacture an emergency just to see an old friend. I would hate to have to order your execution.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Robert laughed, his voice carrying a warmth that defied the tension in the room. “Not at all, Duncan. Unfortunately for both of us, we have an actual problem. The ZRC’s taken that step too far, I’m afraid. Turns out that good old Sammy Parlor had a back-up plan before he came down with that terminal case of knife-in-the-back.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Duncan’s smile faltered, and he leaned forward, his face hardening. “A back-up plan? Elaborate.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Long-story short, he discovered our missing Nightshade heir, and gave him a copy of the report. Terrance?”
  </span>
</p>
<span>
<br/>
  This story has been taken without authorization. Report any sightings.
  <br/>
</span>
<p>
<span>
   The rogue looked decidedly put-on-the-spot, but he stepped forward haltingly. “Um… hello. Your majesty.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The king frowned. “I was led to understand that all of the Nightshades were dead. Tell me true, what is your name?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance swallowed. “I am Terrance Nightshade, your majesty.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Duncan waited a moment, seemingly waiting for whatever truth-detecting enchantment to alert him, and then burst into a broad smile. “Welcome home, young Terrance. Your family has been sorely missed. I would dearly love to hear the whole story of your survival, but… it seems there are important matters to attend to. Where is Samuel Parlor’s report?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Right here, sire.” Terrance held up the envelope with the forged report. An aid walked in front of him, holding a ceremonial plate. Quickly grasping what he was expected to do, Terrance put the envelope on the plate, and the aid nodded at him before carrying it to the king.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Duncan opened the envelope without any fanfare, quickly reading over it. “This is in Samuel’s hand, alright… and the words are his. That much is obvious. Auditing irregularities… bah, he could stand to come to the point. Wordy old man…” The king froze. “An underground facility? The ZRC was experimenting using Undead?” His head rose to look at Maeryn, his eyes blazing with fury. “You. You are the Captain Maeryn he speaks of in his report, are you not?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn opened her mouth to speak, squeaked once, then swallowed and tried again, face flushed with embarrassment. “Yes, your majesty. I am Captain Maeryn, of the airship Stonewing.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The king’s gaze bore into her, his tone commanding. “Tell me
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    everything
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   . How you came to know about the Undead, what you learned while there. Everything. Leave nothing out.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn nodded quickly. “Yes, Sire. My alchemist and mana researcher deduced, upon reading various research reports in Airspire, that Undead beings generate Mist. So when -”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “What?!” Duncan actually rose from his throne at that. “You… you’re telling the truth. When did you discover this? Why haven’t I been told? That’s a monumental discovery!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn bit her lip, but answered truthfully anyway. “My researcher discovered it a little less than a month ago, Sire. But it seems that the Zephyr Research Council has known of this for most of a decade, and hid it from everyone.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Duncan’s face began to burn red with anger, and he seemed lost for words. Which is why it startled Maeryn when the queen spoke. “Heads will roll for this,” the queen spoke sharply, each word coming out clipped and short as her face pinched slightly. She shook her head, gesturing lightly with one hand. “Continue your tale, Captain. Sit, my love.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   At his wife’s understanding but unyielding suggestion, Duncan reluctantly sat down in his throne, but his fingers twitched, tense and sharp as if they itched to throttle the fools who had displeased him so.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn took a deep breath to steady herself, her heart pounding. “Terrance came to me one evening in Airspire, telling me that he’d discovered an underground facility used by the ZRC, where he’d spotted Mist coming out the door. Understanding that there was almost certainly an Undead there, my crew and I became concerned about the presence of an Undead in a populated city, so we decided to investigate. Quietly.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   When no one interrupted, Maeryn swallowed and continued. “Terrance and I, accompanied by another crewmember, broke into the facility under the cover of darkness. We discovered a lab with numerous reagents, and a research journal that indicated they were trying to create Mist bombs.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Duncan’s hands gripped the arms of his throne so tightly that Maeryn could almost hear the wood groan under the pressure. But he said nothing, despite his face bearing a storm of utter fury, so Maeryn kept speaking. “In the final room of the facility, we discovered a necromancer who had transformed himself into an Undead. Keith Laurant.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The revelation hung in the air like a dark cloud. The king’s knuckles were white, his eyes blazing with a mix of horror and fury. The queen, though composed, had a steely glint in her eyes that spoke volumes.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “We… spoke for a time,” Maeryn admitted. “Keith told us how he came to be what and where he was. His parents faked his death, and his cousins used him for their own purposes before sealing him away. He became an Undead to punish them, and the ZRC came to an arrangement with him, hiding his existence in exchange for his cooperation with their experiments. And then he told us that the ZRC had known the truth of the Mist for at least eight years; he’d told them himself.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “My love?” the queen asked calmly, turning to look at her husband.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Yes, my queen?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “When the time comes to execute these fools… be a dear and share.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Of course.” His words were laced with a chilling finality.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn shivered involuntarily. The queen creeped her out fiercely, but she didn’t dare say anything. “At that point, we fought. It was a close fight, but we were able to kill Keith Laurant and burn the body. We left, not knowing what to do next. It wasn’t as though we could confront the ZRC on our own. We departed Airspire with Samuel Parlor not long after.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I see.” Duncan raised his hand to rest his chin on his palm, watching her with calculating eyes. “Then you arrived on Zephyr. Samuel died, and your crew was grounded by our decree. Which is why you went to the Council of Winds, to arrange a meeting to pass on Samuel’s report on his behalf.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Yes, your majesty,” Maeryn agreed, beyond thankful that no questions had been posed to her that required her to even think about dancing around the truth.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Why did Samuel tell you about the report? Or about his connection to us?” the queen asked.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn sorely regretted tempting fate with her last thought. She thought quickly, trying to figure out how to word it in such a way that wouldn’t suggest they had a necromancer, but was immensely relieved when Terrance spoke up.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I introduced myself to him,” the noble boy said simply. “He was excited to hear that I had survived the tragedy eight years ago, and stated that if his report came through me, you would likely accept its legitimacy. I believe he may have known about my family’s previous role as your retainers. But more than that, he wished to ensure that his duty was fulfilled.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn’s mind goggled at him. Every single word that Terrance had said was absolutely the truth, but the way he’d phrased it… How long had he been working on that twisting of the truth?
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The queen leaned back, satisfied with the explanation, though she kept a thoughtful eye on Terrance.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Well then. I believe I’ve heard everything I need to hear,” Duncan stated matter-of-factly. “Captain Maeryn, you have my deepest thanks for your efforts, and an apology for our grounding of your ship. I will send word to have your ship - Stonewing, was it? - prepared for you to depart whenever you wish.” He raised a hand towards one of the men waiting silently at the far side of the room, and the man immediately bowed and made his exit. “However, I must insist on meeting your alchemist, the one who deduced that Mist is generated by the Undead. I fear we will need minds like his in the coming months to determine appropriate countermeasures.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I would be more surprised if an alchemist did not already have ideas on how to address it,” the queen commented. “Tell me, Captain Maeryn… what leads are you pursuing at this time?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn winced. There really wasn’t a way to get around this, was there? “Your Majesty, we, ah… as the Mist is primarily composed of necromantic mana, the current lead being pursued is, um… creating a rune sequence powered by inverted necromantic mana. Similar to a
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Flame Resistance
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   rune sequence, except more
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Necro Resistance.
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   If it works as my alchemist thinks it does, then it should repel the Mist more effectively than existing mana barriers. From there, he believes we should be able to create a rune sequence that effectively purifies the Mist and returns it to unaligned mana.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Sounds logical,” Duncan said slowly. “Yet… you are afraid. Why?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn swallowed hard, cursing her body for betraying her. She glanced at Terrance, who only shook his head at her. There was no escape. She took a deep breath, staring down at the ground as she spoke the words that would make enemies of the royal family. “Because inverting a mana element requires a thorough understanding of the original element. In order to invert necromantic mana… he has to understand necromancy first.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The words hung heavy in the suddenly silent room. Maeryn hardly dared to breathe, thinking fast. If the king and queen decided to kill her or her crew, she’d have to run.
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Body Enhancement
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   , pick up Terrance and make a break for it. Back to the Nightshade mansion, grab everyone. Make a desperate assault on the airfield, get Stonewing
  </span>
<em>
<span>
</span>
</em>
<span>
   operational, and hope for the best. It was a thin plan, but it was all she had, and she didn’t like her odds.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   As the seconds drew longer, Maeryn’s fear grew stronger. She breathed shallowly, and reached for the mana in the air, ready to draw it into her body. Any moment now. At any moment, Duncan would give the order, and -
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Very well. Your crew is officially pardoned for any acts of necromancy, past or future, so long as no citizens of Zephyria are harmed.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Body Enh…”
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   Maeryn’s head shot up, cutting herself off. “What? I’m sorry, Your Majesty, I’m not sure I heard correctly.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Duncan wasn’t smiling, per se, but his expression was softer than she’d expected. “We do what we must for our kingdom, Captain Maeryn. It was not the Zephyrian Research Council who came to me with their knowledge. It was not the Zephyrian Research Council who offered a solution. You and your crew did that. If the Mist is necromantic in nature, then it follows of course that the solution will have its roots in necromancy as well. I do not like it, but I am not so proud that I will not bend if it means saving my people.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Go, Captain Maeryn, Terrance Nightshade. Complete your research. Save our people. And leave the Zephyrian Research Council to us,” the queen intoned gravely.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Robert? Stay behind. We have much to discuss,” Duncan ordered.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Yes, Your Majesty,” the silent-till-then council member acquiesced with a bow.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn and Terrance exchanged a look, and then bowed at the royals as well. “Thank you,” was all Maeryn could think to say. “We’ll be off, then.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Receiving no response, Maeryn did her best to walk out of the throne room as fast as she could without seeming like she was fleeing. She was pretty sure she failed, but it didn’t matter because Terrance looked just as pale and harried as she felt.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The moment they’d left the throne room, they were met with another guard who quietly but firmly ordered them to follow him. They were guided outside, past the gate, and then the guard left without another word.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “That was… way too intense,” Maeryn muttered.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I couldn’t agree more,” Terrance said breathily. “I thought I was going to swallow my tongue a few times there. And you did most of the talking!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn’s let out a nervous laugh. “Well… now they know. And they’re going to take care of the ZRC for us, I guess? So… time to go back to your house and hide for a day or two?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Sounds like a plan to me. Skies above, I want something sweet after that.” Terrance shook his head, wiping his brow. “You want to hit a bakery or something on the way back? You’re supposed to celebrate big things with cake, and I think this qualifies.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn’s heart skipped a beat. “I… Sure. Let’s do it.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   They took their time walking the streets towards a bakery that Terrance had noticed earlier, doing their best to recover from the high-stress encounter with the royal family. Maeryn was just starting to feel almost normal again when Terrance suddenly shoved her hard, sending her stumbling to the ground. “Look out!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Shaking herself off, Maeryn quickly got to her feet, only to see Terrance, weird dagger-with-a-rapier-handle drawn, holding back a blade from a full-grown adult man with long black hair and a manic expression. “Assassin!” somebody screamed - Maeryn had no idea who - and everyone nearby took off running.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Adrenaline flashed through her body, and all sound seemed to drain away as Maeryn’s body coiled, recognizing that she was in combat. Maeryn flashed open both her vambraces and leapt into the fray.
  </span>
</p>
