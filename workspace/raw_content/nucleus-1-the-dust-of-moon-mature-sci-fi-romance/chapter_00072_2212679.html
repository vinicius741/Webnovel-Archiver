<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnNmNGZkYzgzY2MxNzQ2NmU5M2Q2ODJjMTBjZGJhN2Mx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As her soldiers regrouped, Dinu turned back to the Moondust Crystal while she, Joon-Seok and Kaori put away their weapons. The crystal stood before them, its upper part shimmering while the lower half looked decayed and worn.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMGIyMTZhMDM0NzQ1M2VhOGZjNDAzZGY1NTMwYzhk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Tired but determined, Dilinur led them closer to the Crystal. The air got colder with each step. A strange silence surrounded them, making her skin prickle.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YzZhMjljMjY0OTQyNWE5OGY0OWQ1ZGZiYzU0NWVi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">And there it was — the Moondust Crystal, suspended in the chamber. Its silver-blue glow lit up their faces. It was both beautiful and terrifying.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMzAwNjk0NmI5ODRmOWQ5N2E0YmUwZTNjODg5OGE4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Though it didn't speak, Dilinur felt it somehow acknowledge her. The air around it shimmered, as if reality itself bent around it.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZjk3OTM5YjkwODRlYWRhYjQ4MzlhZWI1Y2Y4MWY5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The huge blue crystal reached toward the cavern ceiling like a piece of fallen sky. Deep inside its cracked surface, something moved—not physically, but like ripples of awareness touching Dilinur's mind.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYWU1NTI4NGE1MDQ1MmJhNWU4ZGI1N2I1ZGEwNjUw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"It knows we're here," she whispered, her voice too loud in the silence.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMzM5OGZlNmI5ZjRkY2Q5MGJkZmZkNDMzODhmZTI0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Crystal pulsed once, matching her words for a moment.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NmNhNzNjYTJhYzQxZTc5ZTI5NTk2ZWE5YjY0NmM2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">CUSTODIAN OF PROGRESS... KEEPER OF BALANCE...</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOGU3NjIyNmY3ZjQwZWViOTVlMGZmOThiODM3NGE4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The words appeared in her thoughts uninvited, like something touching her mind.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMjUwZmQzYWUyYTRkZGNiODRhMjA3ODIzYzFlY2Rl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Kaori stumbled backward, her face pale. "It's...it's in my head!" she said, pressing her fingers against her temples.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0Y2UyYWIwOTkyNjRhNDliNjllZjA4OWFmNTNhM2U2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Joon-Seok looked calm, though sweat appeared on his forehead. "Ask what we came to know," he said, his voice strained.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMDhhZThhOGU5NzRiZjI5ZDAzYTE3YTkzYTgwOWY1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur stepped forward, holding her Psi Fan open. "Conjurers! Prepare the Moondust Chant. We deliver the First Attunement as one."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNDRhNmZiZmZjNzRkMGNhMGIzYzc0NTc5NDA0NTMx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Cha!" Behind her, five people in black and red robes moved forward in a neat line. One took out a Holo-Scroll from his sleeve, looking at it nervously.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZGVkZTFmYjkyNDQzZjc5OWZkNGQyMjE4NGY2YmEy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I shall lead..." The man said, holding the scroll with shaking hands, starting in Devavāṇī. "Chandradhooli Ratna, prachin shakti ka srot — [The Moondust Crystal, source of ancient power — ]"</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDJkNGNjYTIyNzQzY2ZiZWRlMmE2YWQxNmE3ZWVl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Chandradhooli Ratna, prachin shakti ka srot —" The other Conjurers repeated, their voices shaking slightly. Dilinur could see them struggling as they recited the words.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzE3ZDI2M2I5ZTQxYWRiZjE3ZjhmYzdlNWRkMzc3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The chamber rumbled, stirring up ancient dust.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYjQ3ZDQ1YjRhOTRlMjE4ZjE4YWVlYmJmZWQ5NWJm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Mann ki gahraiyon mein, tera prakaash chhipa hai! [In the depths of the mind, your light is hidden!]" Dilinur joined in, holding her Psi Fan against her chest. Their voices combined, echoing off the stones.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MzRlNGY2MjIxYzQyZWI5MGVmMmRjMTM4MWFlOTEw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As they chanted, Dilinur felt a dull ache starting in her head. It began at her temples and spread inward. She looked to her side and saw that Joon-Seok wasn't participating. He stood apart, watching with detached interest, avoiding her questioning look.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNTU0N2RjMzFiODQ1YjlhMTRmMzlmODIwZDQwNmMz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Sambandh ki sutra, adrishya dhaaga, [The bond of connection with you, the invisible threads,]" the chant continued. Dilinur forced herself to focus, ignoring Joon-Seok's silence.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5N2I0NjUzMWJlODRmNWZhMjA5OWRmNzFlZTUzZWJk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The rumbling grew stronger, like an earthquake. The ancient chamber seemed to shift beneath them. Dilinur struggled to stay standing as the soldiers behind her gasped and shouted in alarm.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YjMyZmI3NDQ1MTQ5ZmY5NWExMWU5Zjc5YmJkNjk0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Kaori appeared beside her, moving smoothly. She reached out to steady Dilinur before she could fall.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYmE2NzZlZWUzODQ3MjM4YzQwZWZkNjc4NGVmMzEx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Go on. I have you," she said, without her usual haughtiness.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YzViOGI4N2NkNzQwOWNhOWI0ZmY2YjI1ZmM0N2Y4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">With a grateful nod, Dilinur straightened up and continued with determination as they reached the final verse: "Mujhe margdarshan de, tera niyantran pane ke liye! [Guide me as I claim control over you!]"</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDM0YjUxZTJkMTRhNWM4Njk0Zjg1ZjQ3ZWExMTQ0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As the last word echoed through the chamber, Joon-Seok's body suddenly jerked violently. Everyone turned to look at him in horror as he convulsed, his face twisting.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MzBjNzI3YTA3YTRkMTE5NmY1YzIyYTZiYzJjYTVi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">When the Prince turned toward her, Dilinur's blood ran cold. His eyes had rolled back, showing only whites.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNjNmZDE0MmM5MTQ5MzZiMzFlODgwN2VmMWRjYmFj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Dragon's dong!" A Bloodtrooper shouted.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzBiNTk4YTA5YzQ4Mzc5ODgxMzAwZDU4MDljYzkz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Moondust Crystal! It's taken control." A Conjurer said, holding her head, clearly suffering from the same headache Dilinur felt.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkM2E3ZTMwY2RhYTQ4NmFhMzczOGIzYmM1ZmRlOGRl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">When Joon-Seok spoke, it wasn't his voice. Instead, many overlapping voices—male and female, young and old—came from his mouth, creating an eerie sound that filled the chamber.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMDI5MjVmODRjYjQ5ZTdhZGQ3NjZhMmUzOTkwNThm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Chant of Moondust," the voices said through Joon-Seok, his face unnaturally still despite the strange sounds coming from it. "Not heard for eleven rotations of your tiny planet around its sun. Intriguing you possess such knowledge, little human."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMzhhMDcwNWI2ZDQ3YzFiOWYxZTI0YjNmODkwOGVi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur stepped forward, refusing to show fear despite her racing heart. "Release Prince Joon-Seok immediately!"</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOTZmYmMxZDZjNzQxOTY4NGQ2ZWMwOWFiMmNjMjEx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A sound like grinding broken glass came from Joon-Seok's throat—laughter, Dilinur realized with horror.</span></p><span class="cmZhNTg3MWVjYzBmZjQ1NjY4YzUwNzA5ODU4MzYwMDJi"><br/>The author's content has been appropriated; report any instances of this story on Amazon.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM4MTA5ODc5MzU2NjQ3ZTU5M2E2OTI4MzAxOWRhMWQ0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"This vessel serves adequately for communication." The Crystal made Joon-Seok move like a puppet. "I have existed for eons, before your species learned to walk. Why should I listen to your demands, young one?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNmODgxY2E2ZDM4NTRiOTg4ZDA0NWEyZjY0NDdkZWIz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Kaori raised her Phoenix SMG. "The Prince is lost to us. Only one way to free him."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNzZlYTY3MjdmMTQ4NjNhZDJlYTAxZTMwNGMxZTI5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"No, Kaori!" Dilinur held up a hand to stop her.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOTQxMTEyMzVjMzRlZWRhNWNiOGFmZGI5ZTkxYjgz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Moondust Crystal, through Joon-Seok, watched with a cold, amused smile.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYzQ5ZWM1YTczMzQxYmE5ODNlMjM2OTRlMDRiYzli"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Moondust data records that one who recites the complete verse of First Attunement might become Administrator," Dilinur said firmly. "Does that record mean nothing?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZWMwZGJhYmJhOTQ1ZTI5ZmYzZDQ5ZDk2MmJhMzA4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"It means exactly what it has always meant." the voices replied. "But eleven cycles ago, a thief tried to break me apart. To scatter pieces of myself across your solar system — and beyond." Joon-Seok's face twisted with contempt. "The pain inflicted upon me!"</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYmFjYmZjMjc2NDQ0MjI4ZDVhZGQyOWFmNThmYzZj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Who was this thief?" Dilinur demanded. "And why would they weaken your power?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OTgzNTc0MzViYjQ1Yzc4MjI4NDIzZmM3Mzc1MjAx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"A Nordling named Harald Omdal." Joon-Seok's head tilted at an unnatural angle.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMzNiMjJmOWViODQyNmI5MmY5ZGIzOTBhNjM0OGRj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A chill ran down her spine as pieces fell into place. "Harald Omdal," she whispered.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZmQxM2NhMWNmNTQ2NDI4NzAzNjE1YTIwNmQ5NjBj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Archmage of Buskerud." Kaori said, her light brown eyes wide.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZDRlOGNhOWQyMTRlZjI4YWQ5ZmQwNzk2Y2M1NzUw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Indeed." The voices seemed pleased. "He had the nerve to announce his name after stealing my shards!"</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYWQxMTg1YzIzNjQwMTJhNWI5MmY3NGRkMWQ0MjFk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Why would he break you apart?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMDFlNmM5YTM4ZTRiZTQ4YWE4ZjM4YjQ0M2ViMDNm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Fear," the voices said simply. "Fear of what your species might accomplish. Fear of my true purpose."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZjBkNGU2OTNhZDQ1ZWJiOWYyNzJkMGI0YzgxZDQ0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I am Dilinur Altai, a Prefect in the Imperium of Dragons." Dilinur walked around Joon-Seok's possessed form, holding her Psi Fan defensively. "Serve my people well, and you will be rewarded."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YTVjZTY0OThmMjRlMjM5ODljOWEyMGJhMGJlNDNi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Eager." the voices said. "Which minds would you have me control, as Administrator?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NjZhNjNhNjVlYzQ4ZGI5ZjRhMDJhZmFiMDU5Njk0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Primarily, the Radi-Mons," Dilinur pressed. "Control them as you've just controlled my companion."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MDI3NmIyNjg1YTQ0NTY5ZDQwMWZkOTRlYzYwZTVl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Beasts who eat nuclear waste. Their hordes are many, their purposes scattered." Joon-Seok's body stiffened. "Why would you control them?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MWJjYWYwY2YyZTQ5NjViYTI1NzM5ZWNmOTY5NjUx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"To defeat our enemies, and strengthen my people." Dilinur said. "Can you control them?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZjk1MjE0YWRiOTRhYTNiNzEyOGM0YTkwNWZkNDgy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I can influence any being with a brain and cellular structure," the voices replied. "But the Radi-Mons' connection to the Hivemind causes...interference."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzVkNzEzOTRjYzRkOGQ5MTgyOTFiZjczZmE3YTI5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur sensed the answer was evasive. "But as Administrator, I could direct this influence? Command you to subdue them?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NzU2YjlmN2I3NzQwMDY4ZDkzMmVlNDY2MjM0N2Vi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You could," the voices acknowledged. Joon-Seok's body stepped forward, moving unnaturally smoothly. "But I must be whole first. Without my scattered shards, my reach is limited, my power reduced."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMTRlZDg0MTA2NDQyODI5NTY2ZTdhYmI5NmU1Zjgz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"We will retrieve them," Dilinur promised.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NDA1NGI0MWI0NzQwNDY5MDQwZWYyNjJkN2NhZGIz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A long silence followed, while the Crystal's blue light pulsed through the chamber.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MGY2ZTU2OTQxMDQwZjdiMjMwNDI0YzAwYmNjYmIx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Acceptable." the voices finally agreed. "Your order, Administrator?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZTY0NTRiMzAwMTQ2MzQ5M2ZhNzFhNjE0MmY0ZDIx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur straightened up. "Release Prince Joon-Seok at once, and from now on, never control anyone without my explicit permission."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NDEzYjY5MmJlODRlNTJiYzc3NzI3YjAyODdjZmY2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The voices from Joon-Seok's throat darkened. "You set boundaries beyond our terms, Administrator."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDE5ZTYxNWEyMTRlNGM5NjUyMzc1NTQ1MTQ1Y2U0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"If we're going to work together, we need trust." Dilinur said firmly. "Possessing my people without permission destroys that trust."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTQwMmM4OTBjNDQyZjRiNDI2OGIwYTU3YzVkYTFj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">After another pause, Joon-Seok's shoulders slumped. "Very well, Dilinur Altai. As long as you remain Administrator, I shall not enter minds uninvited."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0Mjc1NTVhZjNiZTQ1ZjZhY2I0ZDQ1OTViOTUwMDhi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">With those words, Joon-Seok suddenly went rigid, then collapsed forward like a puppet with cut strings. Dilinur rushed to catch him, but he was too heavy for her. She stumbled under his weight.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZGE4MWVmNjliYTRlN2Q4OGU2OTY3ZTNkNWI4NmFj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Help me!" she called, her voice sharp with concern rather than authority.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMDI1MGYwNzYyZTQ1MzVhYjU5OWIzMzZiYzkxYjg3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Kaori was there immediately, supporting Joon-Seok from the other side. Two Bloodtroopers joined them.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMDkzOTUxZDQzYjQzYzliZjg2NmRkZTRlZWI4OWIz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Together, they carefully lowered the Prince to the ground. Dilinur knelt beside him, automatically brushing back the black hair that had fallen over his forehead.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYmY5OWQzYTk5MDQ1OTc5ZDE4MmJmODQzYjcxNTcz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Bring water, quickly!" she ordered, not looking up. Her concerned tone made several soldiers exchange surprised glances.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiODE2NmQzMWFkODQ3ZmVhZjJmYTVkOWYxN2VkMTYx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"His pulse is strong," Kaori said quietly, with her fingers on Joon-Seok's wrist. "Whatever that thing did to him, it doesn't seem to have caused physical harm."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YzlhM2U4YjY1NTQ4NGQ5MmI0YjExNmU5ZGEwOWE3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur's hand stayed on his cheek, her thumb gently tracing his jawline. "Joon-Seok," she called softly, then louder, "Prince Pak! Can you hear me?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYWY0ZWIyZjdlYjQ1NjlhYTQ3ODc2NzA2Y2Q2YTgy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">His eyelids fluttered, then slowly opened. "Dinu?" he whispered, using her nickname without thinking.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMzY2ZTY4M2U1MTQ2OWE5MDNhZTcxZjFhZTVmNGZm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I'm here," she replied, relief washing over her face. "How do you feel?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NmI2MzFmMzExMDQ0OTY4MmJkYzFkN2MxZDZlMzk1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Joon-Seok tried to sit up, grimacing. "Like I've been trampled by elephants," he muttered. "What happened? I remember the chanting, and then...nothing."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOTZlZGEzYWEzZDRlYzhhNTRkYTRjMmViOWRjM2M5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A Bloodtrooper appeared with a canteen. "Prefect. Spring water from Mountain Jade, with Indra-Sprite added."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NWZkZThjMDNiYTRhNmNhNmEyZDU1NzgxNGViNWU3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Good." Dilinur took it and helped Joon-Seok drink, supporting his head gently.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NmU0NTkyZGE3NDQyNDJiY2I1NDhmMmU1YjFlOWNi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Crystal spoke through you," she explained quietly. "It possessed you completely."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Nzc4ZjM3NDA4ZTQyNGE5MWYzNDI5Nzg5YTJkNTQ1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Horror appeared in his eyes. "I was possessed?" The idea seemed to wound his pride.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhY2VkYTJiMmQ5NDQxMTRiODRmY2I5MTE0YzJjNDQ4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"It won't happen again," Dilinur assured him fiercely. "I've made sure of that."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZjAzMTBlNWE1ZTRlZjc5NjE2MTgzMmMzMTBjMzFm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She turned to the Conjurer who had led the chant. "Take care of the Prince. Use whatever healing spells you know. I want him recovered immediately."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNzIxYzlhYTNkZTQ2MDM4MTg0MzJlODNlYzcxODlh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Conjurer bowed deeply. "Surakṣitaḥ Asi," he said, his hands starting to glow with psionic energy as he approached Joon-Seok.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNjhlYTliNTY2MDRkZjdhY2E5ZWEyYmRlOGNkYjEy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As two Bloodtroopers carefully helped Joon-Seok sit up, his hand caught Dilinur's, his voice stronger now. "Did we succeed?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZWY4ZDg3YmQyYzRkOTdiZjAwY2E5M2I3MDI1ZWI4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur's lips curved in a small, satisfied smile. "Yes. The Crystal is ours." She squeezed his hand once before letting go. "Rest now. I'll handle the rest."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ODBjNDI4NjQ2NzQwN2Q5YTE1ZGE1OTI3NjZmNzQ1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Only when she was sure Joon-Seok was being properly cared for by the Conjurer did Dilinur turn back to the massive Crystal. Its light had changed, becoming steadier, more focused—almost expectant.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMjM2ZmMxMTI2NzQ1MjdhOWUyMWU1NjQ3NTYyZjEw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Peons!" she called, her voice regaining its usual commanding tone. "Prepare tethers and containment field. We're taking this artifact to Celestial Reach."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YmM0MzA5Nzk1YTQ3ZDJhNTNjZWQ2YjhhNDQ0OWMw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As her soldiers hurried to obey, Dilinur glanced once more at Joon-Seok, who was watching her from where he sat surrounded by the Conjurer's healing aura. Their eyes met across the chamber, silently acknowledging something changed, something deeper than their shared mission.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNTQyMGFjN2E2OTQyOTM4NWI5NWJjMzE1YjJmOTJm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Behind her, the Moondust Crystal's light pulsed once more, neither approving nor rejecting her in its silent acknowledgment.</span></p>
