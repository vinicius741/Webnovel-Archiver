<p class="cnMxY2ZhYzE5NDNhYzQ3OTZiNGJmZWZmM2ZlYzU2NDJi" style="margin-bottom: 0">Looking out over the desert as I brought us in to land at one of the massive enclosed cities, I frowned at what I saw. Mandalore was a world with an environment devastated by war. From orbit, we had only seen a few large green and blue spots left in the wild—less than thirty percent of the planet. My research showed that once, the planet had been very Earth-like. Now, large tracts of it were desert. The majority of their habitation was in big cities built as cubes or domes to make an environment a bit more hospitable to life. Sundari was under one such dome.</p>

When waging war anywhere but a desert, you expect to be able to either establish trade or forcibly acquire certain goods and services from the locals because there typically tend to be locals to acquire them from, with their own infrastructure, manufacturing base, agriculture, and the like. In a desert, depending on the type of desert… There is no solid ground upon which to construct a building, if it’s all sand. But you can work around that, with tents and other temporary structures. Except there are no <em>building materials</em><span style="font-style: normal"> present locally. Little to no wood, and almost certainly no trees large enough to cut down to turn into building materials, so you have to bring your own with you. Water is also scarce and sometimes contaminated. There is little to no food, depending on where you are.</span></p>

A missed supply of perishables means your men go on half rations, which leaves them tired, hungry, and angry and reduces their ability to fight. A missed supply of ammunition and suddenly, they’re left rationing that and trying to convince the enemy they have more than they do. </span><span style="font-style: normal">Fighting power and morale are constantly on the decline, because of those factors, in addition to other environmental factors.

You have to dig a latrine. That’s just basic sanitation. We do it because we don’t want to contaminate our camps. But you see, if there are any local populations, especially wandering tribal populations, then they </span><em>don’t always do that</em><span style="font-style: normal">. In fact, most just cop a squat wherever the need takes them, sometimes even right in their own camps. During the day this dries out and over time, it breaks down under wind and sand, and becomes little more than dust mixed in with the sand.” I smiled and turned to look at her over my shoulder. “Right until it hits something wet. Like your nostrils. Or your mouth. Or whatever water you’re drinking. Then suddenly, the smell and taste are in </span><em>everything</em><span style="font-style: normal">.”</span></p>

I turned back to the instruments and continued. “It contaminates all of the water eventually, so you start having to decontaminate it. And the easiest, cheapest way to do so given your lack of resources is to filter and add alcohol just to be sure. Of course, with water being strictly rationed, personal hygiene isn’t going to be what you’re used to. Forget daily showers. You </span><em>might</em><span style="font-style: normal"> get to take a sponge bath using about a gallon of water a night, if you’re lucky. The stench of body odor becomes a thing you just become accustomed to. You stop really noticing it until it gets </span><em>really bad</em><span style="font-style: normal">. </span><span style="font-style: normal">Then there are the bodies. Forget the enemy corpses, getting your own fallen men home is almost impossible, and many of them are simply consigned to the sand…”</span></p>

I followed him and Obi out of the cockpit back to my quarters and grabbed my bag. I was leaving most of my gear in the ship, since I wasn’t expecting to need any of the wilderness survival equipment. Instead, I was just bringing a couple of changes of clothes. Everything important, I was leaving behind, just in case.</p>

<p class="cnNkZmE2NzJmNTk3NzQwZjFiMjZhYzE2YTA4OWQ0NDRi" style="margin-bottom: 0">We were diplomats trying to broker some kind of deal between the Mandalorian factions and some people might not appreciate the idea of any sort of deal, or someone sticking their noses in where they felt they didn’t belong. Killing a diplomatic envoy was a time honored tactic in war—sometimes even done as part of a false flag operation by the faction the diplomats were ostensibly supporting, simply as an excuse to point to them and rally supporters behind the idea that they were being persecuted or otherwise under attack. I wouldn’t say I <em>expected</em><span style="font-style: normal"> there to be an attack, but </span><em>I wouldn’t be surprised if there was</em><span style="font-style: normal">. And since I knew we were staying in a hotel for the duration of our time on Mandalore, </span><em>and the enemy knew that as well</em><span style="font-style: normal">, I wasn’t bringing anything from the ship that I wasn’t willing to see destroyed if someone were to, say, hit the building with a rocket attack.</span></p>

There was a good chance that trying to blow up a ship would have unintended consequences that could be disastrous for the city as a whole, up to and including overwhelming the air filtration system with noxious fumes and smoke. No, no one would risk something that flashy in a docking bay. They </span><em>might</em><span style="font-style: normal"> try to break into the ship, however. </span><span style="font-style: normal">Personally, if I were going to do it, I’d plant remote explosives on an enemy ship, wait for them to leave the city, then have them detonate on a proximity timer when they got far enough away.</span><span style="font-style: normal"> </span><span style="font-style: normal">That was just something we’d have to prepare for and plan around.</span></p>

We were waved through what passed for customs with the Masters showing some sort of diplomatic identification and soon out onto street level. Looking around, I found myself fairly impressed by the architecture. Sure, it was just another city, but this one had buildings hanging from the ceiling. It seemed they had done everything they could not to waste space, while still leaving enough for it to feel relatively open and not claustrophobic.</p>

<p class="cnM5ODQxMTg5ZTY1NDRkNGM5NThjYzQ0Yjg1MjFjMmEz" style="margin-bottom: 0">We took a speeder to the inverted building near where the negotiations were being hosted and quickly settled into our rooms in a massive suite at the bottom of the tower—what would have been the top on a normal building. Obi and I shared one room, while the Masters each had their own separate room. Once we were settled in and freshened up, we left the hotel for the conference center where the summit was being hosted.</p>

<p class="cnNkMzNiZjAwNzVjNDQwNWRiM2YyMzVmYjE4OGJjZTlh" style="margin-bottom: 0">Once inside, we were directed into a large room with raised stadium seating, already starting to fill in with interested parties as, even if this wasn’t open to the public, there were plenty of people supporting both sides: investors, political allies, and the like—not to mention all of the support staff running back and forth, some civilian, some clearly military. Already, there was shouting from several people gathered in the center—and in the middle of it all, an older human man and a younger human woman. In fact, looking around, I realized I was one of a very small number of people who were anything other than pure human.</p>

He had short black hair with a bit of gray in it and black stubble. He wore the same armor that I saw the more militarized Mandalorians wearing—the armor having been painted over gray with red accents, and a red half cape on his back.</p>

I had a general idea of how things were going to go, now that the mediators had arrived. Master Dooku would likely separate the leaders of both factions and assign one Master to each, so they could go over their side’s views and just what exactly it was they wanted in more detail, without the other faction butting in. Since there were three of them, one Master—possibly Dooku himself, if he was taking the lead on this and wanted to look unbiased—would schmooze with the backers representing both sides.</p>

We’d go back to the hotel, the Masters would share what they had learned and compare notes, then come up with an initial strategy. They might take </span><span style="font-style: normal">several</span><span style="font-style: normal"> days to speak with Mereel and Kryze more in depth, perhaps do some touring and meet with their backers behind closed doors.</span></p>

Preferably a closed door negotiation. Master Dooku, presumably, would then lay out what each side wanted, where they agreed, where they disagreed, and start working on what each was willing to concede on—where they were willing to give ground, meet in the middle, or what they were willing to trade. Kryze and Mereel would then take that back to their people, then come back with revised demands and concessions, and so on and so forth, until eventually a deal was struck.</p>

Still, I listened diligently just in case there were some new points. The basics were all the same: don’t point it at anything you don’t intend to kill, always be sure of your target and what’s around and behind it, treat it as if it’s loaded unless you’ve verified it’s unloaded. There were really only so many ways of trying to get across the point that they were dangerous and would kill someone if you weren’t careful.</p>

Never fire inside a civilian ship, most of their hulls weren’t rated to take the hit, and would rapidly vent into space. Perform regular maintenance before use, unless you had some desire to replace whatever hand you were using with a prosthetic.</p>

<p class="cnM2NTJhNWFiYWVkNzQyMGZhY2ZmMjg4ZmVkNWZkYjBh" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">We headed to the back of the ship after shutting it off and Jango opened up the armory and machine room, where he began taking out weapons and laying them out on the table. “These are all spares, so no one’s going to care if we borrow them, or if one or two go missing.”</p>

<p class="cnNiOWE1ODE3MTY2ODQ0MWFiY2JmNzU0OThmMGJiMmRk" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal">I watched as he worked for a few moments, picking out a selection of blasters from pistols to rifles, and even a heavier gun that looked like it could be mounted </span><span style="font-style: normal">on</span><span style="font-style: normal"> a turret. </span><span style="font-style: normal">Taking out a toolkit, he began placing tools on the table. “Let’s start with maintenance. I’m going to teach you how to field strip everything on this table. Now, where should we start?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNTFmZWZiMTFmYjQyMThiYWY3NGFmYjQyZTBhYmE3" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM1MGI4YTdmZjY1OTQwYTY5ZjkxMDYzMDVjM2RjMjA0" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<span style="font-style: normal">Verify that each weapon’s </span><span style="font-style: normal">power pack has been removed,” I answered, and he nodded, gesturing me towards the table.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYjliODcyYjdiNTRkZDlhOWQzNTdiNDcxMGVmYzEz" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNjOTZjMjRhMTE2NjRlZWRiZGRlNmY5MjEyNTQxYjRh" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">What followed was a process I was intimately familiar with from my last life, if modified for new weapons. Jango showed me how to break down and field strip every weapon, clean it, verify there were no issues, then put them back together. The entire process took a few hours given just how many guns he had selected, but I was fine with that. I knew I would be using them soon and I didn’t mind cleaning and maintaining them if it meant I wouldn’t accidentally blow my hands off.</p>
<p class="cnNhNjI5Mzg0NmVmYTQ2MjA4NzQ5Mzc2MjBlZDcwMWIy" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMwN2JkMjVkNjE3ZDRiY2ZiYjBmMTUyY2M1YmU0NTU0" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">Finally, we finished with maintenance and he collected a bunch of power packs, a can of spray paint, and a folding table, leaving me in charge of carrying the blasters outside. When I simply picked them and the table up using the Force, he chuckled and led me out of the ship, where we set up the table at the base of the ramp.</p>
<p class="cnNmNTE1NjBhNjJlMjRhMzQ4ZTBlY2I5NDY3NjI0ZGU4" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMyNmZlZTRlNjViMjRlOTg5YTYzNTVhNjUxOTgyYjc0" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal">While I laid out the weapons and power packs, Jango moved over to a rock formation and painted a simple man-shaped target onto it before moving back to the table. “Alright, let’s try out the pistols first,” he instructed and pointed to the one furthest to the left—the smallest of the lot. “That’s a holdout blaster. Aiming works pretty much the same as it does for a slug thrower. As it’s a plasma weapon, there is less recoil, but there’s still </span><em>some</em><span style="font-style: normal">. Go ahead and give it a try.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDMzYTk4M2MzNjRiZGJiYjAyNzJjMDVhOTIyNWZh" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMyNzBkNGY4Zjg3YjRhN2FhOTNjODEzNzU2NDQ3YTk2" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">Nodding, I took up the weapon and slotted in the power pack. Verifying it was charged, I made sure it wasn’t on safe and took aim, before firing. As he’d said, there was a very minor recoil—less even than I remembered there being with the 9mm Parabellum I was familiar with for Imperial sidearms. The blaster bolt hit pretty much exactly where I’d aimed and I hummed.</p>
<p class="cnNmOTkyYjA2OGUxNTQ3MmM5NTE3M2VkODdlNTQzMGM1" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMzYjA1NzYyYTk5ZjQyNzQ5ZjNlY2NhOTBhM2EwMTJj" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<span style="font-style: normal">Tell me,” I began, spinning up a formula to start taking measurements and firing off a second round—measuring the gravity of the planet, rotation, magnetic field strength, and the rise, drop, and speed of the projectile, “are blaster bolts affected by a planet’s gravity, magnetic field, wind, </span><span style="font-style: normal">rain</span><span style="font-style: normal">?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNTJjODdiMzY0OTQzMDNhYTYzZWU2OTk0ZWRiMmM0" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM4Y2YxY2ViNjQ3NDQ2ZDY5MDUzNjRmZDZkNDg5Nzkw" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<span style="font-style: normal">Gravity, only minutely. You won’t really notice before the magnetic field holding the plasma in disintegrates at the end of its effective range. </span><span style="font-style: normal">Magnetic fields are a yes, but they have to be really strong to affect a shot. The planet’s magnetic field will cause a shot to start to drop, but again, it’ll hit the end of its effective range before you need to worry about it unless you’re using some big sniper. Unlike solid projectiles, windage isn’t a problem to consider, outside of atmosphere reducing the range of your shot. Water will reduce it even further.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZWYwMDMxZWJiNzQwMDhhMzZjN2JjY2E5NGJiODYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM3NGEzMGU2NmFmMjQ4NjI5NzNhMDBlZjQwYTA4N2Zj" style="margin-bottom: 0">Nodding along as Jango explained, I turned away from the target and aimed out into the desert. I took three shots with the holdout blaster, measuring and noting each shot, before moving on to the next blaster on the table and doing the same. Then the next, and so on. After the fifth he asked, “What are you doing?”</p>
<p class="cnNjYjhiOTdkNzZmNDQyMGNhMmI2YmQ0NDc2YWVhOWYw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM2MjE0NDQ0N2EyNTQ1ZWFhMGE5ZDkwMTg3ZTBmZjFj" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<em>Math</em><span style="font-style: normal">,” I answered distractedly. “When you account for or eliminate all other variables, such as gravity, magnetic fields, the planet’s rotation, wind, rain and you know your constants—that is your weapon’s range and its projectile’s speed—</span><span style="font-style: normal">t</span><span style="font-style: normal">hen the only variables left to account for are an enemy’s current position, speed, range to target, </span><span style="font-style: normal">concealment, cover, and armor rating… and I can detect and determine all of those. Being able to look up a weapon’s specs on the network is nice, but those are in a controlled environment, not real world numbers. I have a very long list of those numbers written down and many of them memorized, but being able to compare published numbers to real world data allows me to determine how much variance there is between the two and adjust. I’ll have to do it for every planet and even multiple environments and conditions on those planets for complete precision, but I’ll settle for </span><em>close enough</em><span style="font-style: normal">.”</span></p>

<p class="cnM3NDY3MTBjNWE0ZDRhYjY4NzY0NWRmZDI2NTVjMDhm" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">Confused, Jango asked, “And then what?”</p>
<p class="cnM2YTk2Y2E1MTZkZDRkYjhiMGQzYjRmZjhmOGEzYmUx" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNhYjllNDdkMWEzNDQ0YTM5M2Y4NjMwYjY4NGYyZDRh" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">I turned a smile on him and, for some reason, the man’s hand jerked towards his holster only to freeze halfway. “Imagine what you could do if you had the world’s most accurate targeting computer in your head.”</p>
<p class="cnMyNTBkNWNkYzUwNzQwOTE5ZDYxMDA1YzA0NjBiYjc5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNkNjE5ZjI4ZDNkZjQ1ODg4NTEwZGFlYThiZDA0ODZk" style="margin-bottom: 0">He considered it for a few moments before humming. “Prove it. We’ve got a target launcher we use for practicing against moving targets.”</p>
<p class="cnMyZmQ4YmNhMTVjMzQ1YTk5Yjk1NjQ1NTZhODc4ODI5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM3NjgxYjUzZTRhODQzMWFhY2I3ZDZiYjZhNWU5Zjdi" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Sounds fun~,” I turned my attention back to the weapons and the man hurried away into the ship, very carefully controlling his body language so as to not show just how bothered he was.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZDJhNjZjNGJkNTRhOWZiNmM4MzBhZTYyMjdiM2Jl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
