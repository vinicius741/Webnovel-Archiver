   Emma struggled to think. The only thing that was on her mind was the kiss that kept repeating itself. She tried to focus on the small breathing girl in front of her. Little Sora passed out fast after the busy day full of commotion.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The vampire calmed her breathing and closed her eyes, trying to find something else. Surprisingly, there was something. She focused on it trying to grasp this fleeting thought, finding a memory.

   Emma looked around her alien apartment. It was a completely foreign feeling. Her body moved on its own, but Emma’s thoughts and memories aligned with her vampire self. This version of her was unknown.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Tear drops fell from the pilot’s eyes, and rained onto a small end table. The drops covered the papers she had in front of her. A flash of pain attacked Emma’s chest as the girl continued to sob.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “It’s all my fault,” the girl said. Her hands drooped limply to her sides. She leaned back in her chair and covered her eyes with the back of her right hand.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma remembered now. All of the hope in the world would not bring that little girl back. There was nothing her or anyone else could do. The girl looked down again, staring at the adoption papers. A part of her wanted to shred them, but a larger part of her wanted to keep them.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   They would serve as a constant reminder. A reminder of why Emma hated both the cold and blood.
  </p>

   When Emma opened her eyes, she found herself wrapped in the arms of Lunaria. Tears wet Emma’s face, and the vampire’s heart throbbed in pain. In this state, she couldn’t even be embarrassed about this shameful position.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The dragon’s strong arms wrapped around Emma’s shoulders and held her tightly. “You were crying in your sleep. I wasn’t sure what to do, but Karlack said…”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma shook her head and latched onto the arm, keeping it there. The vampire forced a smile onto her face and chuckled. “You should have simply lied to me and said it was your idea.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The vampire checked on Sora before turning around and staring at Lunaria’s face. “I don’t know what your real goal is, but I hope you don’t intend to break my heart.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Lunaria grabbed onto Emma’s hand with her own and held it. She stared at the two bracelets connecting them with a smile. “What if I said that my true goal is simply to make you happy and protect you all.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “I don’t understand. We only just met, so why would you want to do something so troublesome?”
  </p>

   “Did you know that here, Lunaria means the dragon of the moon?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “No. What does that have to do with anything?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Lunaria sighed. “Ultimately, it means that I’m skilled in moon magic. The way that I stored the rest of the mammoth meat was also because of this, but lunar magic has tons of uses. One of them is predicting the future in a way.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “Don’t tell me...Are you my fated lover or something?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The dragon girl laughed. “No, there is no such thing as that. Rather, I wasn’t able to accurately gauge you at all. I knew that you existed, but your future is sort of blank to me. It wasn’t supposed to be like this at all. A catastrophe was supposed to happen.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “A catastrophe?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The dragon nodded. “At the center of a white blizzard, you were supposed to be there. All of the north was supposed to fall to the frigid cold, and this was sure to happen rapidly...I’m not sure what changed it, and that’s really all I know. This ability is not omnipotent, yet the course has changed so much. There is not even snow here.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma’s eyes widened. She looked back towards the sleeping Sora.
   <em>
    Is it because I saved her?

   The vampire remembered her dream and wondered what she would have done if Sora passed in the same way. Would she have gone mad? When would it have happened? Emma was almost certain that if she never got to know Sora, she’d be a completely different vampire.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   When Emma first found herself in this world, she could have easily disregarded its people and their lives. She’d already shown that she didn’t care about much.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The vampire sighed and decided to change gears. “I understand that part, but what does that have to do with you coming after me.” Emma pointed at the bracelets. “What does it have to do with these?”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Lunaria pressed her forehead against Emma’s. “I’m very sorry if it bothers you. I just feel a connection to you like I’ve never felt before. I don’t really understand it, but my heart beats more in your presence. I feel like life has suddenly become more interesting, and it makes me want to protect you. To be with you.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma blushed and turned her head. “Those are all shallow feelings. Even now I can feel my heart racing, too, but isn’t this just lust? You don’t even know me, and I don’t know you very well either.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “What about Sora? You protected her without knowing her. You pretend to distance yourself, but even right now, I can see the way you constantly turn your head to make sure she’s okay. Even if all you give her is the cold shoulder, she understands everything that you try to do for her.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma laughed at the absurdity of her situation. “I once hated both the cold and blood, and now I am one with them. I befriended a little girl, a sword, and a horse. Then the first dragon I run into says she wants to be my wife.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Lunaria smiled. “What’s wrong with being a little indulgent? I love you, and if it helps, these bracelets are the sign.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “If you really love me, I need you to promise you won’t break my heart or hurt Sora.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   The dragon touched their bracelets together. “I promise. And on my pride as a dragon, you can kill me should I break the promise.” Lunaria grinned devilishly. “To seal the deal, we should make the pact with a kiss.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma became meek, trying to shrink away under the dragon’s vivid gaze. But her chin was grabbed once more. She was held captive by the moon dragon.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   “I will never let you go as long as I’m alive.”
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   Emma remembered tales of dragons hoarding things. Such was their greed to steal away all of people’s gold, yet this dragon tried to steal away Emma’s heart. And it was working.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   As their lips met in a more passionate kiss, Emma surrendered herself to the feeling. She had truly fallen prey to the hoarder.
