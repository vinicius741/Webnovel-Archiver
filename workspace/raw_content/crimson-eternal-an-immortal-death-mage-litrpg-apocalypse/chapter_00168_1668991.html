For one, I added the descriptions for four different nations. Arian, the Frost Clan, the Rex Dynasty of the Dead, and the Shengshi Dynasty. And for two, I added a few characters to the glossary and altered a few details about some of the other nations to compensate for the time that's passed. Albeit not many details.</strong></span></p><span class="cjk2MTdiMTA1NTk5YTQwZGI5NTk0ZDk5MTMzNTg1NDNi"><br/>The story has been illicitly taken; should you find it on Amazon, report the infringement.<br/></span>
