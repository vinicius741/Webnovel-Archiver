<p class="cnMxMmY1ZmUyMjNkZTQxNzY5OGQ1NjFmODk5NDQ5Njk3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn didn’t quite know what to make of Samuel Parlor. He was tall and reasonably good-looking, neither muscular nor noticeably overweight. His beard and hair - both kept short, mostly dark blond, with strands of white shooting through it, suggesting he was approaching middle age - were kept tidy to the point of immaculate. He dressed well, but not ostentatiously so, and despite his noble status, he kept a sword at his hip. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjYzc3NTkyMDU3MDQyYmM4NGJhODI3OTA4MGU4ZWRl"><span style="font-weight: 400">If it weren’t for the sword, Maeryn would have been reasonably confident that he was a lower-class noble, or at least a noble who wasn’t so full of themselves that they needed to show it off. But something about the way he wore the sword, and moved with it… even though Samuel Parlor didn’t look terribly fit, he had experience with the blade. Maeryn would have bet on it. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1Y2M0ZDlhMTQ5MTQzZGQ4ZWQxNDdjZWE0NzkyNTdi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Captain Maeryn. I assume all is well? Are all preparations made for the trip tomorrow?” Parlor asked, his tone calm and professional. The two of them were in a meeting room at the recruitment center, as Maeryn had learned was the custom when it came to the contracts in Airspire, and the hunter just couldn’t seem to get a read on him. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0YzQxZjZlZmM5MjRkMTI5MjUwMDM4NTIxMWZjZDQ2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, everything is fine. I’m simply here to finalize arrangements per our last discussion.” Maeryn tapped the paper in front of her. “We’ll be ready to leave first thing in the morning. I… do feel like I should remind you that the quarters we have are rather small, and that our airship isn’t designed for luxury or for, um, entertaining nobility,” she said hesitantly. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhZGM4MzZhYWM1NDQzZjliMjNkNDVjN2YwNTBhYjA3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s not a problem.” Parlor leaned forward, his expression unchanging. It was honestly somewhat intimidating. “As I’ve stated before, I’m more interested in getting to Zephyr than I am in being entertained along the way. Peace and quiet suits my purposes far more than watching hastily put together shows of drama and comedy.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ODNlMTc2MmU2MjRjNjY5ZTlhN2NlNDNiY2IxZGUy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn breathed in deeply and nodded. “Alright then. What time do you want to leave tomorrow?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM2N2Q4MzI5YTlkNDQwMjU4OGQ4YzdjODEzMmVkNDMz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“As early as possible. Will six work for you?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5OGJjZTgwNDYyZTQ0ODY4MzFhYjliNzMxNGZmYzkw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We can make that work,” Maeryn agreed. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlNmUwNjBmMDk3MDRiOTE4ODgzYTYzYjI4NzI1MjNm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then I believe our business is concluded. If there’s nothing else?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjYjFhNDYwMTczMzQ4YWM4NTkxYWEzZTA5NGE0MTg5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s nothing, no.” They both stood, and shook hands. “I’ll see you tomorrow morning, then.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYTcwNzkxZWVkZTRkZjQ4YzQ4ZGMyNjhhNTMzZTI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Until then.” Parlor gave a brusque nod and strode out without turning back. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1NDU5Njk5ZWE2MDRmYjRhODg5MzllMGE5MTg0NmQz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn watched him go with a frown. “I just can’t get a read on him… why is he so intense?” she muttered, before shaking her head. “Not my business. It’s not your business, Rin, don’t obsess over it. After the month is over you’ll probably never see him again anyway.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYzE1Mzk5NzQ5YTRiZWFhMzNhZTBmMWJmNWFmNjEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">And yet, despite her words, Maeryn knew she’d be keeping a close eye on Samuel Parlor. Maybe it was just paranoia, but she had a feeling that the nobleman was involved in something more than a simple business deal, and she wanted nothing to do with it. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxNzhmMGY2NWVkZTRjNDA5Yjg0NDg4NWZlZjBmMjYy"><span style="font-weight: 400">On her way out of the recruitment center, Maeryn looked around for her captain acquaintance, Captain Jenkins of the airship Breegull, but the man was nowhere to be found. Maybe he’d gone to Cloudreach like she’d suggested, but Maeryn had kind of wanted to wish him farewell, especially since she was going to be gone for a few weeks. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmYjc2MzlkZGZlNjQxYzJhZjYwZTIxMjBlNzBlODg3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh well. They’d meet again, Maeryn was certain of it. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhMzI3ZDM0NDkyMDQ0MDhhNWM0ODgzNjViYmExMDA4"><span style="font-weight: 400">As it was the last time she’d step foot on Airspire for most of a month, Maeryn took the rest of the afternoon to explore and see the sights. As she passed by the Zephyrian Research Center, she allowed a rueful smile to cross her face. It had been almost two weeks since poor Jake at reception had told her his woes about the broken coffee machine, and Maeryn had bought him coffee from every coffee shop nearby to see if it would help the man cope. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1YjY3OTgyN2RkYzQwZDhhM2QzYmIwMjBiY2RjNTNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Jake had appreciated the gesture, but there was apparently something magical in the coffee machine - beyond being powered by runes - that gave him the extra kick he needed to be properly functional. The worst of his caffeine withdrawal had passed, but the unlucky receptionist was still perpetually exhausted. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3YmUyMWQ2NDFjMzRiNjViZTJmNDQ1OWQ3YWFlMGVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn eventually made her way back to the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Dancing Dragonflies </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">inn, and she stood in front of it for a few minutes, contemplating. She hadn’t been on Airspire long, and yet… she’d gotten comfortable here. Unexpectedly so. Not quite as comfortable as home, but…</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZDU1YTgzN2E5YzQ3MmU5ZjQ0MmU4Njc1OGYyYTM4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn stilled. She hadn’t really thought about her home in Vert for… How long had it been? Days, certainly. Maybe a week? Guilt bubbled in her stomach, and she grimaced, sitting down at a nearby bench. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiMTZkMjU0NGRiZDQyYmU5MDBhMzA0OWI2ZDhhZmE3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Were her parents okay? Surely by now they’d read her letter to them. What did they think of her? Did they approve of what she was doing? Had they, and Frankie’s mother, and Dan’s colleagues in the Alchemical Workshop, had any or all of them tried to convince the Elders to send people to retrieve them? </span></p>
<p class="cnM1ODkzOWQ3OTUxZjQ4YTQ5MmY0NjBlN2FmOGIxMWUy"><span style="font-weight: 400">What if there were other Geovans in Cloudreach right now, looking for them? </span></p>
<p class="cnMzMDA3N2Q1MzcxMDQ1ZDZhN2U3ODMyNTJkMWY4Y2Mw"><span style="font-weight: 400">What if there weren’t? What if they’d written off Maeryn and her crew? Did they think Maeryn and her friends were dead?</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMzA5MGU5MzFiMDQ1YzBhN2Y5ZjM3NjkwZWQ4ZTlk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn lowered her head, now wholeheartedly regretting that she hadn’t taken the time to speak to her parents before she left. Yes, maybe they could have somehow convinced her not to go on this crazy mission, but not knowing what they thought of her now… it hurt, in a way she couldn’t describe. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhYzQ5NTc4MzQ3ZTRmNmI5ZDczYjExM2ZkN2JjZjAw"><span style="font-weight: 400">She took a deep, shuddering breath, wrestling back control of her emotions. She’d see them again. Someday. And then she’d be able to tell them about her adventure, and all the crazy things that had happened, and even if they thought that she’d been rash or immature, Maeryn would be able to show them that she’d made a difference, and then they’d forgive her. Right? </span></p>
<p class="cnM5NTQ4ODRiYmIwZTRjZDQ4NWViN2RkMTk2MWJhNTI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">… Right? </span></p>
<p class="cnM1OWEwNWI3MjFkOTQxMTk4MjcxZGNmZmNmZGQ2Yjhk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn closed her eyes, trying not to acknowledge the wetness on her cheeks. She couldn’t go back. She’d made the best decisions she could. Her parents would understand that. They had to understand that. They’d raised her to be a problem-solver, and the Mist was a problem to be solved. She’d laid out all of her motivations and justifications in her letter to them. </span></p><span class="cjI1MGUxOWI0ZmQwNTQ3N2E5NzA2ZTE2MmQyN2EwZjUw"><br/>Stolen content warning: this tale belongs on Royal Road. Report any occurrences elsewhere.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNkYzg3M2QwNjVmNTQyODk5NDA5MTE5MzE5ZWYxMGJk"><span style="font-weight: 400">She’d done the best she could. Hopefully her parents would see that, too. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1MTViYzRiMDAzZjQwMzRhYWE4YmUzMTcyYThkYzU1"><span style="font-weight: 400">And if they couldn’t… then where the abyss were </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">they? </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">A flicker of anger ignited in her heart, roiling around the grief that threatened to seize her lungs, and yet the two emotions harmonized instead of quenching each other, leaving Maeryn feeling like she was holding a storm inside her chest. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZGQzM2QyMzUyNDRiZmM5OTU2OTg5NjQ4NmUwNjY5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn was sixteen years old! She shouldn’t, couldn’t have been the only one to notice the trends in the estimated timeline! They were running out of time, and nobody had been doing what had to be done! Even if Maeryn had been rash - and that was a big if, considering how long she’d been planning with Dan and Frankie - then it was only because of the failure of </span><strong><em>every adult who should have done this before she felt the need to! </em></strong></p>
<p class="cnNmOTExYWE3NmNkZTRmNzFiZmJkMTkzMjVjOWVlNzQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Because now… now she couldn’t go home. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzZjYyMzAyYzQ0YzQ5YTRhYWM3ODVhMjc2OGQyNmIx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn’s fists, which had unconsciously clenched, loosened abruptly as the storm of emotion broke, leaving nothing but wholehearted grief, and she buried her face into her hands as she choked out a sob. It felt like she had to literally drag it out of her chest, and even though she knew it wasn’t actually tearing little gashes along her throat as she did, it still left her aching and sore inside. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlNjNmZWNhMDZhZjRmNTE5ODE3MDA2OGY5M2E0MGEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">She wanted to go home. She wanted her parents. But that wasn’t possible anymore. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5MTk5YzdkNWE0NTRhNjk5MDE0ODk0NzMwMzgxZmIz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn inhaled sharply, and wiped roughly at her cheeks. She couldn’t go back. She’d known that when she left. What was she doing? She was better than this. She was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">better </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">than this. She couldn’t just sit around crying, when there were other things that she could be doing. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0MDgzYWEyMTdjMDQ0NTE4ZmM1MDZmYTBiZmI0ZDI5"><span style="font-weight: 400">The more she was able to support her team, the faster they’d be able to solve the Mist problem, and the faster she’d be able to go back. She just had to focus on what she could do. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwNGYyMDZiYTcyMDQ0NjA4YjZiZDc0Y2RlZjhmZDcy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just focus, Rin…” she muttered fiercely to herself. “Just. Focus.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0OGFkZDE0Yjg4OTQ5NGY5N2EyYzI1YWQ1MmI4YzFk"><span style="font-weight: 400">With her homesickness abated, though not fully dispelled, Maeryn was able to get to her feet and walk into the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Dancing Dragonflies </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">inn. It was time to check on Dan and Ernesto’s progress. </span></p>
<hr/>
<p class="cnNmMGRlNmZhNzFlOTRlYTg5ZGU4Zjg3N2Q2NTI5NmEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Peter? Do you have a minute?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmODM4M2ExZDAyOTRjOTNhNTA2YWUwYjBlMGZlMzRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Peter looked up from the latest blueprints that he and Frankie had been working on together. “Sure, Frankie. What’s on your mind?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiZTFlZTViMGQyMjQwOGE5M2JmODk1Y2NmYWZlZDFl"><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl seemed hesitant, almost nervous, which was an expression that he’d never seen on her face before. Peter’s heart thumped extra-hard. Was something wrong? He hadn’t done anything, had he? No, nothing came to mind… </span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZWY4MjAzMjJlZDQ2NThhYjQzNzY1ZmIwZTljMDNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I, um… My Captain’s taken a contract. It’s going to take us out of Airspire for a few weeks,” Frankie explained quietly. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjBiMzM3ODNiZDQ2YzZhYmEwOTUyNGRhOTIxOTZm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh.” Peter grimaced. That meant weeks without partnering with her. He didn’t know where Frankie had come from, but she was incredible, with ideas that he was sure he never would have thought of. Even better, she could follow him when his brain went all chaotic and jumped between seemingly unconnected ideas. He’d never found anyone who just “got” him so easily, like they were two winds dancing in canyons, and he wasn’t looking forward to having to adjust to working without her again. And he was sure that Chief was going to tease him more while she was gone, calling him “lovesick” or something. “Can I ask where you’re headed?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOWIyOWFlYzk1NzQ0OGQ5MzUzZjZmMjY4NTMwMmE3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Zephyr.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM1YzQzYThlNjFkOTRlYjg5OTAxYjMzYjE5NjA4NDZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Peter let out a low whistle. “The capital? Wow. I bet there’ll be tons of airship engineers over there.” He tried to sound nonchalant about it - jealousy wasn’t attractive, everyone always said. But some irrational part of his brain whispered that Frankie would think that the engineers over there were easier to work with, or more fun or something, and… </span></p>
<p class="cnNhZjVhOWZiNTFmMTQyMjlhYmU0MzdjZDU5NTQ5YTVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Probably,” Frankie agreed, “but I wanted to ask something before we go.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjZDliNzlhMmJlMDQ1MjRhNWU2Mzg2OTNiOTFmYjdl"><span style="font-weight: 400">That stopped Peter’s self-deprecating spiral in its tracks. “Yeah?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTdjMzM3YzlhYTQ3MWFhYTM1Yzc0YmM4NDQ3MmFi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do… do you want to come with us?” Frankie asked quickly, almost stumbling over the words as they tried to escape. “It’s a small crew, I’m the engineer and pilot, and my Captain’s been looking for a second pilot, and I’m sure I could teach you </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">everything </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">about Stonewing</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">and, and…” Her voice suddenly became very small, as Frankie looked down, visibly blushing as she fidgeted with her hands. “I’d like it if you came with us.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3OGYwNWRmYmZjNTQyY2ZiM2ZiMjEwNjNiMGQyMzAw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Peter blinked. It felt like his brain was stuttering. He understood each of the words that Frankie had just said, but it was like the total meaning just… escaped him. “You… want me… to join your crew? As second pilot?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmOTlkODc1MjEzMDQ5ZGQ4ZWU0YWFjNTM2OWVmZTI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And second engineer,” Frankie confirmed, her voice just as quiet as before. “I, um… I know it’s really, really short notice. We leave tomorrow morning, and… and I would totally understand if you’re not sure or it’s just not enough time to think about it! I mean, you’ve got a good thing here, right?” Her voice was quickly reaching its normal decibels again as she rambled. “I mean, the stuff you do here is amazing and fun and amazingly fun and it’s not like I’m not going to come back! I’ll just be gone for a few weeks and then we can get right back where we left off, promise! Don’t worry about it. Ignore me! Let’s just get back to that blueprint and - !” </span></p>
<p class="cnNkZjliMGY3Y2M2MDRhNDU4YTRmZmM2ZWFjOTIxMzAx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’d love to go with you.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiMmZhNThkZTcxZjQ5MGY5YWIwZDExNjg3ZDFiMjRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“ - see about improving that… wait. What’d you just say?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZmIxOWMzMzQ2NTRiMjE5OWEyMjg3ZWRlZTc5MjY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Peter took a deep breath. This was the most impulsive decision he’d ever made in his life, but… he was going to do it anyway. “I want to go with you. What do I need to do?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhODdiNzc3NGQzMTQyMTU4ZTYwMDQ5MGQyZDRjZjBh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You… you’re serious?” The smile growing on Frankie’s face was like the sun rising, and Peter felt his face flush. “That’s great! Yes!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZmE4Y2UzOGY5ZTRlODA5M2U1N2JlYzQ3ZDk1Nzlh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s this? Did someone finally work up the nerve to ask the other out?” Chief questioned with a teasing, knowing smile as he walked over from where he’d been helping other engineers. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxZWM0MDNhYTYyZDRjN2FhNDdlMjFjNjBhMTI4ZWFl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Chief… she just invited me to be second pilot and second engineer on her Captain’s airship,” Peter breathed. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2YTQxOTM3YTc0YTQxM2JhMWM2ZjNjNTU3Y2VjNzdl"><span style="font-weight: 400">The man stopped in his tracks, blinking rapidly and mouth moving yet not making any sounds. “That’s… by the winds, that’s one storm of an offer. You’re serious, lass?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDYyZTUzNTMzZjRiOGFiMjllN2RjZTA4OTNiYTdi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Frankie nodded firmly. “I’m my Captain’s primary engineer and pilot. I fixed up Stonewing</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">myself, and I know her inside and out. And Peter works really, really well with me. I think he could do it. And I think he could do it really well.” She frowned, looking a little remorseful. “I know that I’m basically poaching him from you. Sorry.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzMzAyYWM2NTQ0ZjQ2OGViOTFiMDg2NjM5MGJmYTI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, you’re not wrong, but… second pilot </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">and</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> second engineer?” Chief looked at Peter in amazement. “Lad, that’s not an offer that comes every day, even for a small airship. I know men half again my age that would slit throats for an opportunity like this. A position like that, with a halfway decent Captain, and you’re set for life. Assuming you can keep up with the work. What’re you thinking?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM4OTEwMzI3MDM4YjRiZDA5MDUyY2JmZGM1NTY5Mzg4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Peter swallowed heavily. “Yeah. I… I’m going to take it. I really do appreciate everything you’ve done for me, Chief, but…” He glanced out of the corner of his eye at Frankie. “I think this is the right decision for me.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM4YmZkMjgzYjMwNjRiNjRhYjAyY2E5OTBkYWRmYTE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t blame ya.” Chief shook his head. “You two’re always welcome back here if you want to do more tinkering. So you better come back and let me know how you’re doing!” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmMjM0MjA4MmU1OTRlNGFhNzQ2MmI4MDZlYmQ2MzA1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Chief!” Frankie and Peter agreed in sync. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiMjgwNzExMzQ1ZjQzZTliY2QxMGM4YjIzYTRkNzcx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good! Now go see that Captain of yours so you can join the crew officially.” The two of them grinned at each other and ran off, and Chief shook his head ruefully. “Back in my day, you were supposed to be going steady for years </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">before </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">you moved in together in cramped spaces. Youth these days…” </span></p>
