   Kaelan entered Commander's tent to find the half-breed already there. He startled at her arrival before settling into his accustomed glower. The tent's interior hung heavy with the scent of oil lamps and worn leather, the canvas walls rippling softly in the breeze. "Good, we're all here," Commander said, spreading a worn leather map across the low table. His movements were precise, practiced, like a man who had been planning military operations for centuries rather than decades. Kaelan marked but didn’t comment on the half-full glass of amber liquid he set to one side. "Let's get down to business."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   They gathered around as he traced a route through Etienne with his finger, stopping at various marked locations. "Yolanda's operation runs deeper than we initially thought," Commander began. "She's not just trafficking from Asapaco. She's established satellite operations in at least three other cities, including Etienne. Our intel suggests that she's moving a large shipment through here in the next few days."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What kind of shipment?" Kaelan asked, studying the marks.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Commander's expression darkened. "People. Specifically, people with potential Talent abilities. She's selling them to the highest bidders - warlords, private collectors, fighting pits."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A cold rage settled in her stomach. No one deserved slavery, not even half-breeds.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Our contact infiltrated one of her supply chains months ago,” Commander continued. “The shipment includes medical supplies and equipment stolen from several settlements, critical resources they can't survive without. Yolanda's using the chaos from the thefts as cover for her real operation."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "So we're hitting two birds with one stone," Vertigo said, leaning over the map. "Take down her slave trade and recover the stolen supplies."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Precisely." Commander pointed to a marked warehouse near the river district. "This is their primary staging area. The supply depot is here." He indicated another location several blocks away. "And their security headquarters is here." A third point completed the triangle.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That's spread out," the half-breed observed.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yes, and that's where things get tricky." Commander straightened, rolling his shoulders as if to ease a persistent ache. He looked at both of them in turn, his gaze lingering first on Vertigo, then on Kaelan. "Yolanda expects us to come for her after Asapaco. She's prepared. Her forces in Etienne have been bolstered with additional mercenaries, and she's paying the local authority handsomely to look the other way."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan watched Vertigo's expression darken at the mention of Asapaco, a muscle tightening in his jaw. There was history there. "So a direct assault is out," he mused, leaning further over the map. "Infiltration, then?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yes, but with a twist." Commander turned to Kaelan. "This is where you come in. Yolanda doesn't know about you yet. You're our ace."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan felt the half-breed’s eyes on her, assessing, wondering. She kept her expression neutral. "Okay, what's the plan?" she asked.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Commander's smile was grim. "You and Vertigo will pose as independent mercenaries looking for work. With your abilities, you should catch Yolanda's interest; she's always recruiting Talents. Once inside, you'll identify the captives and locate the stolen supplies. My contact will be ready to help you move them out."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Wait," Vertigo interjected, "you want me to go undercover with
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    her
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   ?" He jerked a thumb at Kaelan. "We can barely stand each other. No one's going to believe we're partners."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That's why it works," Commander replied smoothly. "You're not supposed to like each other. You're supposed to be two highly skilled individuals with a temporary business arrangement - believable, efficient, and available to the highest bidder."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan silently evaluated the plan. It had merit, though the risks were significant. Her fingers absently traced the corner of the map, feeling the texture of the worn parchment. "How do we make contact with Yolanda's people?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Through the Crimson Raven tavern. It's a known recruitment spot for her operation." Commander handed her a small token, a copper coin stamped with an unfamiliar symbol. "Show this to the barkeep. He'll direct you to the right people."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What about Dominique?" Vertigo asked, concern lacing his voice. "If she's there, she'll recognize me immediately."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Intel suggests she's not in Etienne," Commander replied. "But if you do encounter her, improvise."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "She won't buy it," Vertigo argued, running a hand through his hair in frustration. "She's not stupid, and she knows me. She tried to recruit me, remember? Now I show up with a new partner right when you're hunting her boss? It's too obvious."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Make her buy it," Commander said flatly. "Your life and the lives of those captives depend on it. If necessary, convince her you've reconsidered her offer. Make her believe you're playing both sides. Do whatever it takes."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The conversation shifted to details; communication protocols, escape routes, contingency plans. Kaelan listened attentively, mentally mapping the city based on Commander's description and the markings on the map.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You'll need to go around the Scorched Plains," Commander continued, tracing a wide arc on the map around a region marked with jagged lines and warning symbols. "That'll add at least two days to your journey."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo frowned. "Couldn't we cut straight through? The eastern edge has been cooling for years."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Not worth the risk," Commander replied firmly. “I’d give you a vehicle but that doesn’t fit with your cover story. Two mercenaries on foot will draw less attention anyway.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan studied the map more closely. The Scorched Plains had been ground zero for some of the most devastating exchanges during what mortals called the Great War, or more simply, the Apocalypse. What they didn't know was that the nuclear missiles had been aimed at the aerial battle between angels and demons raging in the skies above.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Both sides had survived, but the land below hadn't. Centuries later, the Plains remained a wasteland of glass deserts, radioactive hotspots, and mutation zones where reality itself had been warped by the confluence of nuclear and magical energies.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I've been through worse," Vertigo muttered, though his bravado didn't quite mask the unease in his eyes.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The longer route is safer," Commander insisted, his tone softening slightly. "I need you both at full strength when you reach Etienne. One misstep in the Plains could drain your magic for days."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan nodded, remembering her few encounters with similar distorted zones. "The eastern route will serve our purpose. We'll be less likely to attract attention on the common roads anyway."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Commander spread his hands on the table, leaning forward. "There's one more thing," he said, his voice dropping further. "Yolanda may have sources watching the main approaches to Etienne. You'll need to enter from the south, through the refugee quarter. It's chaotic enough that two more wanderers won't draw attention."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The refugee quarter is a maze," Vertigo pointed out, frowning at the map. "We could lose days just finding our way through."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I've marked a path," Commander said, indicating a thin line drawn in faded red ink. "It's not the most direct route, but it will get you there without unnecessary delays."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan studied the route, memorizing each turn and landmark. "How current is this information?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Two weeks," Commander replied. "Recent enough for our purposes." He straightened, rolling up the map with a finality that signaled the end of the briefing. "You leave at dawn. Get some rest. You'll need it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo exhaled loudly through his nose, clearly unsatisfied with some aspect of the plan but unwilling to challenge Commander further. He pushed away from the table, his movements tense with contained energy. "I'll go pack."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As he ducked out of the tent, Commander turned to Kaelan. "He's been through a lot with Yolanda. This mission may bring up unresolved issues."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Is that why you're sending us together?" Kaelan asked, studying Commander's face. "To keep him in check?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A faint smile touched Commander's lips. "I'm sending you together because you balance each other's strengths and weaknesses. Whether you realize it yet or not." He gestured toward the tent flap. "Now go. Dawn comes early."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She made her way to her own tent, small and spartanly furnished. Her few possessions were already packed, ready for swift departure. Unlike the half-breed, she traveled light by habit, carrying only what she could not replace or conjure with magic.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Sleep came fitfully, her mind cycling through the mission parameters, the dangers that lay ahead, and the strange partnership she'd been thrust into with Vertigo. Above it all hung the shadow of Kaldi's growing threat to the angelic realm. How much time did they have before matters there reached a breaking point? And would Commander's assistance be enough to turn the tide?
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dawn found her already awake, watching the first pale light seep through the canvas of her tent. Outside, the camp stirred to life, voices calling orders, equipment being readied. She rose, donned her leather gear, and stepped out to meet the day.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Commander and the half-breed met her at his tent, supplies and gear ready to go. Kaelan adjusted the strap of her pack, feeling its weight settling across her shoulders. Beside her, Vertigo stood silent, his massive sword sheathed across his back, cloak pulled tight against the morning chill.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Commander’s face was grim in the half-light. "Remember," he said, voice pitched low for their ears only, "the lives of those captives depend on you working together. Don't let personal differences compromise the mission."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan nodded once, sharply. Vertigo merely grunted, his breath forming a small cloud in the cool air. With no further ceremony, they headed out, leaving the safety of the camp behind. Kaelan set a brisk pace, wanting to cover as much ground as possible before the heat of the day set in. Vertigo matched her stride easily, his longer legs allowing him to keep up without apparent effort.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The landscape around them gradually changed as they traveled, the scrubby grasslands giving way to more rugged terrain. By midday, the distant smudge of the Scorched Plains was visible on the horizon, a shimmering haze that distorted the air above it.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   They spoke little, conserving energy for the journey. Occasionally Vertigo would point out a landmark or suggest a route adjustment, and Kaelan would either nod or shake her head in response.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As the sun began its descent, Kaelan spotted a suitable campsite: a small outcropping of rocks that would provide shelter from the wind and a modicum of protection from any nocturnal predators. She veered toward it without discussion, trusting Vertigo to follow.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "We'll stop here for the night," she announced, the first full sentence she'd spoken in hours.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo surveyed the site, his eyes narrowed against the setting sun. "Good sightlines," he acknowledged grudgingly. "Defensible."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   They fell into roles without discussion, Vertigo gathering scraps of dry brush and wood for a fire while Kaelan cleared a space among the rocks. There was something disconcerting about performing these mundane tasks alongside a half-breed. The sun had fully set by the time they had a small fire going, its flames casting flickering shadows across the rock face behind them. Vertigo rummaged through his pack, producing a dented metal pot and a packet of dried rations.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Hope you like mystery stew," he said dryly, emptying the contents into the pot with a bit more force than necessary. "Chef's special."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "As long as it's food, I don't care what it's called," Kaelan replied, settling back against one of the rocks. The day's journey had been uneventful but tiring, more mentally than physically. Constantly maintaining her guard around the half-breed took more energy than she cared to admit.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He picked up their dinner, ready to put the pot over the flames, but she reached out and took it from him. “Hey, what do you think you're doing?” he protested.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She favored him with an even look. “Your Commander warned me about your cooking skills.” In great detail. He seemed to enjoy telling embarrassing stories about Vertigo.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He huffed a little. “Just because I burned the water that one time, they won't leave me alone about it...”
  </span>
 </p>
 <span>
  <br/>

  <br/>
 </span>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Yes, he told me that story. Among others.” She turned to the fire, stirring the pot's contents. “I'd like to have edible food tonight,” she continued.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “I thought you were some kind of angel or something,” he complained, picking up a stick to prod the fire unnecessarily. “So how come you have to eat?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   With an effort she damped her irritation. It was an ignorant question, but curiosity was only natural. “It's true we have fewer needs than living mortals do, but magic costs energy. That energy comes from within ourselves, which means we have to replenish that energy somehow, which means eating. Aren’t you always starving after using your powers?” She sat with her knees tucked to one side, gazing into the fire.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Wait, what?” He focused in on that tiny little detail. “Living mortals? Aren't you... y'know....”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She smiled humorlessly. “Why do you think most of the myths about angels involve humans dying to become one?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo jerked back slightly, his hand tightening on the stick. “You're dead? Like, a zombie or something?” He shivered visibly and leaned away from her.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Annoyance warred with amusement and she settled on a mix of something in between. “Resurrected, not dead. The Goddess changed me into.... something else.” She made it clear with her tone that she didn’t want to continue on the subject. She hadn’t thought about her own death in a long time. Tonight was not the time to dredge up those memories, especially not for him.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “And you said I was the freak,” he muttered, breaking the stick and tossing the pieces into the fire.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Not a freak,” she corrected, narrowing her eyes at him. “Dangerous. There’s a difference.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A muscle worked in his jaw as he absorbed this. For a moment Kaelan thought he might press the point, demand more details about her transformation, but instead he just stared into the flames, lost in his own thoughts.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   They lapsed into silence, the only sounds the crackling of the fire and the occasional bubbling of the stew. Kaelan stirred it mechanically, her mind returning to the mission. In a few days they would enter Etienne as strangers, pretending alliance while surrounded by enemies. She would have to trust this half-breed to play his part convincingly, to watch her back in hostile territory. She worked best on her own, hadn’t had a partner since-
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "We should discuss how we met," she said abruptly, breaking the silence. "For our cover story."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo looked up, seemingly surprised by her initiative. Firelight flickered red in his eyes, reminding her of his half-breed status. "Right. Needs to be simple, but believable."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "A joint contract two months ago," she suggested. "Escorting a valuable shipment through contested territory. We worked well enough together that we've continued the arrangement when it's mutually beneficial."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He nodded slowly. "Not friends, just business associates. That works." A hint of a smirk crossed his face. "I'll be sure to act like I can barely tolerate you."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I'm confident you'll be convincing," she replied dryly, stirring the stew with more force than necessary.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What about our names?" he asked, shifting to a more practical concern. "Should we use aliases?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan considered. "I'll keep mine. It's distinctive enough without being recognizable to Yolanda's people. You should probably use something other than Vertigo, though. It's too connected to Commander."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He grimaced. "Fine. I'll go by Ataru. It's what my mother called me, before..." He trailed off, something vulnerable flickering across his face before vanishing behind his usual mask of irritation.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan filed the information away; a rare personal detail freely offered. Not that it mattered, but it was useful to understand what drove the half-breed. Everyone had their wounds, their histories. Even demons.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Ataru it is," she agreed, then turned her attention back to the stew. "Almost ready."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo nodded absently.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The psychic connection slammed into her head like a bolt of lightning. Kaelan gasped, a hand rising to her forehead. “We’re not under attack,” she managed as the half-breed startled and reached for his weapon. “Give… give me a minute.” Standing, she staggered to the edge of the circle of light their fire cast.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <span>
    ::Chidara?::
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   Very few angels owned the power to speak across realms; her former mentor’s best friend was one of them.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <span>
    ::Kaelan. Finally.::
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   The voice in her mind was strained, tinged with exhaustion and urgency.
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    ::Where are you? Things are getting worse.::
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   A flash of images accompanied the sending, of angels arguing in the council chambers, raised voices, divided loyalties.
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    ::We’re getting rumors,::
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   Chidara continued,
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    ::of Kaldi actually capturing angels, forcing them to cooperate.::
   </span>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan’s wince had nothing to do with the eyewatering pain the force of Chidara’s sending was causing.
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    ::She can’t get away with that, the council-::
   </span>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <span>
    ::Half the council is on her side already,::
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   Chidara interrupted. Her mental voice was sharp and edged with rare fear.
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    ::I need you with me on this one, Kaelan.::
   </span>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan hesitated, wavering, uncertain how much to reveal about Commander and her bargain. Saying too much might cause its own sort of problems.
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    ::I’m… gathering resources that might help us. I just need a little more time.::
   </span>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <span>
    ::We don’t have much time. Vaethir managed to get a copy of the ritual pattern she’s formulating. It’s worse than we thought. We’re getting close to open hostilities.::

  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <span>
    ::Just a little more time,::
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   Kaelan begged, pressing her fingers to her temples as if that could ease the pressure building behind her eyes.
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    ::If I’m right about this it might be a huge advantage.::
   </span>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The sending wavered, Chidara's strength fading. ::
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    I'm sending you the ritual pattern we intercepted. Study it. Maybe you'll see something we missed.::
   </span>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Complex symbols flowed into Kaelan's mind, a runic circle of frightening complexity, designed to channel essence from hundreds of angels simultaneously. At its center, a void pattern made her spirit recoil. The connection abruptly cut off, the other angel gone from her mind. She examined the ritual pattern again in her memory, searching for weaknesses, for some clue to Kaldi's ultimate goal. The void symbol at its center troubled her deeply; it suggested not just power transfer but something more fundamental, a reshaping of reality itself. Something about the arrangement reminded her of ancient warnings about the barriers between realms.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    Irithak!
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   ” she cursed as understanding set in. Chidara was right - it was worse than she thought. Centuries of hunting demons, and now she might be witnessing something far worse than anything a single demon could accomplish. She glanced back at the campfire, at the half-breed sitting there unaware and unconcerned with angel politics and for a moment she envied his ignorance. Battling the urge to abandon Commander and this useless half-breed and transfer home right now, she stalked back to the fire and kicked a wave of sand at it.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo sat tensed, half-ready to rise, hand still on his sword. “You wanna tell me what that was all about?” he asked, watching her carefully.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It's nothing to do with you," she snapped, wishing she'd never run into the three of them, never made a deal with Commander, never left the angelic realm in the first place. The stew bubbled over, hissing as it hit the flames. "Shit."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “If you’re gonna go cross-eyed in the middle of an operation, it sure as hell has to do with me,” he shot back. “I need to know if you're gonna space out and leave me hanging."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan ignored him, salvaging what she could of their dinner. Her hands moved automatically while her mind raced. Should she leave? Return to the angelic realm and join the fight against Kaldi directly? But if she did, would it make a difference? Especially when Kaldi already had the loyalty of half the council? Chidara needed more than just another fighter; she needed an advantage, something unexpected.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   No. Commander had offered a way to help, and she had to see it through. Whatever his true nature and motives, he understood power in ways she didn't, had connections she could use. This mission in Etienne was the first step toward earning his full cooperation.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Hey. I’m talking to you.” Vertigo refused to let the matter rest.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “It was a message,” she bit out, dividing the food into two bowls, careful to pick all the bits of dried meat over to his. “From Chidara, an elder angel.” She shoved one at him, the contents threatening to slop over the side.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He raised an eyebrow. “I know it tastes bad, but…”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “I don’t eat meat,” she answered curtly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Really?” He scoffed, looking between her and the stew in genuine disbelief. “You’ll kill demons and Talents all day long but you won’t eat something that’s already dead?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “They’ve done nothing to deserve it,” she responded before she could think better of it. She didn’t owe him an explanation. To avoid further discussion she stuffed a spoonful of stew in her mouth, burning herself on the hot food. Her wince was only partially due to the pain; it tasted better than the container it had come in, and that was its only virtue.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Neither did we," Vertigo pointed out, his voice quieter now, with an undercurrent of something that might have been pain.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The simple statement caught her off-guard. She looked up to find him staring at her, his expression not angry but strangely contemplative. For the first time, she wondered if he truly understood what she was - what she had been created to do. Angels were hunters, soldiers in a cosmic war that had raged since before human civilization. And half-breeds, whether they knew it or not, were on the other side of that divide. “Except for the part where it looked like you were trying to help that demon get away,” she countered, looking back down at her bowl.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo made a helpless, frustrated gesture with his spoon, throwing his arms out wide. “Fine, you’re the high and mighty angel, always justified no matter what.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   His words pricked at her more than she’d like to admit, so she focused on eating in silence, scraping her bowl clean and then tossing the utensils at his feet. “I cooked, you can clean up.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Fine.” He didn’t look at her, which suited her just fine. She got to her feet and began pacing the perimeter of the camp. His curiosity won out over his anger again for a moment, and he asked, “What are you doing?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Casting a ward.” She kept her attention on threading the spell. The lines of magic glowed blue-white in her augmented vision, although she doubted it would be visible to the half-breed. “If something crosses it I’ll know.” Her fingers traced complex patterns in the air, leaving trails of luminescence only she could see. The magic responded to her will, weaving itself into a protective barrier that encircled their small campsite. She could feel it taking shape, an extension of her awareness stretching out into the darkness. The ward wasn't just a simple alarm system; it was a complex network of interlocking energy patterns, each designed to resonate at a specific frequency if disturbed. She could distinguish between animal, human, and supernatural presences, a refinement she'd developed over centuries of solitary hunting.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Why can’t you teach me something useful like that instead of meditating and target practice?” he complained.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan did turn at that, pausing her working for a moment. "First rule of power," she said, "is that it's not yours."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo frowned. "What's that supposed to mean?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It means that magic doesn't belong to you. It flows through you. The moment you think you control it completely is the moment it becomes most dangerous. And you can’t control it without fine tuning your senses. You’ll burn yourself out, or-” she inclined her head- “level a camp.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “I haven’t done anything like that yet,” he grumbled, reaching for a bowl and beginning to scour it with sand, although she noticed a slight tremble in his fingers.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “I’ll bet you’ve been using the same tricks for years.” She didn’t press, turning her attention back to her ward. “Now that you know more is possible, you’re going to try more. Like the lava.” Finishing her circuit, she closed the circle with the blue-white snap of a spark. The faint scent of ozone reached her nose. “Fire is the most destructive element. Used incorrectly it can be devastating.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "And used correctly?" he asked, surprising her with the insightful question. It was something a novice might ask.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan paused, considering. "Used correctly, it can purify, transform, create. Every element has its dual nature." She walked back toward the fire, feeling the comforting flare of the ward settling into place around them. "Fire can destroy, but it also brings warmth and light." She sat back down, cross-legged, on the far side of the fire. "The key is balance. Respect for the element you're channeling. Understanding its nature rather than trying to force it to your will."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo was watching her with an intensity that made her uncomfortable. "Is that how you see us?" he asked finally. "Half-breeds. As elements to be balanced? Contained?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I... don't know," she admitted, surprising herself with the honesty. "I've spent centuries hunting your kind. It's what I was made for."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yet here you are, working with me." There was something challenging in his tone, but also genuine curiosity.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Necessity makes for strange alliances." She looked into the fire, unwilling to meet his gaze. "And you're not exactly typical of your kind."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "How would you know?" he pressed. "How many half-breeds have you actually talked to before killing them?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The question hit her like a physical blow. How many had she dispatched without a second thought? Hundreds? Thousands over the centuries? "This conversation is pointless," she said, getting to her feet. "We should rest. I'll take first watch," she said over her shoulder. "I'll wake you in four hours."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Fine," he muttered, finishing with the dishes and settling onto his own bedroll. "Just try not to stab me in my sleep."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "If I wanted you dead, half-breed, you wouldn't have woken up this morning," she replied, the words coming out harsher than she'd intended.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Instead of responding with anger, Vertigo merely chuckled, the sound surprisingly warm in the night air. "Good to know where we stand," he said, rolling onto his side away from her. "Sleep tight, angel. Don’t let the demons bite."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan settled into a meditation posture, her eyes scanning the darkness beyond their camp. The ward hummed at the edge of her awareness, a comforting presence. She found herself reviewing the ritual pattern Chidara had sent, trying to decipher its structure, its weaknesses. For a moment she thought about telling Commander what she’d discovered, but it could wait. They had a little time, and it would be a more effective bargaining chip in person where she could sketch things out.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She closed her eyes. Her fingers absently traced the copper token Commander had given her, its surface already warming to her touch. Strange how something so small could lead them into Yolanda's operation. Stranger still that she found herself here at all, partnered with a half-breed while the angelic realm teetered on the edge of civil war.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaldi had always been intense, even before her Revelation. Not unstable, not then, just driven, relentlessly certain that whatever she believed was absolute truth. How many centuries had she known the older angel? Long enough that Kaelan should have seen the warning signs before Kaldi started speaking of "necessary sacrifices" and "the greater good at any cost."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Now those same phrases were being echoed in the council chambers, according to Chidara. The old divisions were resurfacing, those who believed in balance versus those who preached intervention. Those who saw mortals as worth protecting and guiding versus those who saw them as tools or obstacles.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The ritual pattern flashed across her mind again. Kaldi had been obsessed with the Lodestone from the beginning, convinced it held the key to something profound, and after her Revelation certain that it could save them all from the darkness she insisted was coming.
  </span>
  <span>
   In her mind, removing the source of the conflict between angels and demons would end the endless war. Now, it seemed she’d found the key to destroying the mortal realm.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Across the fire, Vertigo shifted in his sleep, muttering something unintelligible. The ward pulsed softly at the edges of her awareness, undisturbed by any outside presence. In the darkness beyond their camp, crickets chirped their endless song, unconcerned with the schemes of angels or the fate of realms.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan gazed up at the stars, so different from the lights of the angelic realm, and wondered which world she was truly fighting for.
