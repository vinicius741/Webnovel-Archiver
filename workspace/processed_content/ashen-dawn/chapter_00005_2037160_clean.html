   Vertigo stared at Commander in disbelief, certain he'd heard wrong. He drew a deep breath, but before he could bellow his outrage, Commander pushed him up against the alley wall, forcing all the air out of him, and held him there.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Shut up and listen,” Commander said, low and intense. Held by the chest, Vertigo rolled his eyes downward as a movement caught his attention. Commander's free hand twitched as though nervous, his fingers moving. “I said listen!” He brought his attention back up to the other man's face. “I'm giving you to Yolanda, but not permanently. I got enough from her to fill in the pieces of this plan she's got to discredit me. I want you to play along, be good, watch everything you can. Meanwhile we're gonna finish business and move out, but not far. Bliss is going to sneak in and destroy the evidence. Once you get the word, burn everything to the ground.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo huffed, his angry shout dying in his throat. “Now that's more like it.” He shoved Commander off him. “You couldn't have fucking led with that part?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The taller man grinned, some of the tension leaving him as well. “Nice to keep you on your toes once in a while.” He clapped Vertigo on the back hard enough to nearly make him lose his balance.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Rolling his eyes, Vertigo stepped into place at Commander's shoulder. “Let me guess, I have just long enough to go back and get my stuff.” An exasperated grunt escaped him at the affirmative nod. “You couldn't have given me at least the rest of the day to work shit out?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “The longer you have to think about it, the longer you have to screw yourself up. Just go in there and play the obedient.” Commander winked. “I know it'll be tough acting but hang in there.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo rolled his eyes again, refraining from further commentary.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As they reached the inn, Vertigo stalked inside, not bothering to hide his foul temper. His cloak streamed behind him, threatening to knock over stray items. Upstairs in his room he began to shove things into his duffel bag without regard for crumpled clothing. Midway through he sensed a presence at the open door. He didn't turn around, instead struggling to zip the carelessly stuffed bag.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “You're going to rip it.” Nathan's hands reached from behind him and somehow got the bag shut. A small sigh, just a puff of air, ruffled Vertigo's hair. “He's sending you off alone on some damn fool crazy-ass job again, isn't he?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo just stared straight ahead, not seeing the wooden walls or the sunlight streaming through the window. “Yeah.” He exhaled hard through his nose. “I don't mind it, it's just I wish he'd quit jerking me around for once, y'know?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Yeah.” Nathan rested a light hand on his shoulder. When he glanced down, Nathan quickly withdrew it. “Just... be careful, ok? Don't get yourself killed doing some idiot stunt.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He turned to flash a cocky, confident grin over his shoulder. “Me? Pull stunts? Since when?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Nathan raised an eyebrow, unable to stop a smirk. “That time you got yourself and Bliss kicked out of the bar for that drinking contest just last month, that gambling ring business at Sol Merino, Etienne...”
  </span>
  <span>
   His eyes lingered on Vertigo's face, softer than his teasing tone would suggest.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Those weren't stunts," Vertigo protested. "Those were... tactical decisions."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Right." Nathan rolled his eyes, but there was no real annoyance in it. "Like that time you jumped off the cliff into the ravine to catch that smuggler?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I caught him, didn't I?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "After I had to climb down and dig you both out from under that landslide," Nathan reminded him, moving to help gather the last of Vertigo's belongings. "You never think things through."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo remained oblivious to Nathan's reaction. "I think plenty of things through. Just... quickly."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Nathan huffed a quiet laugh. "That's what worries me." His voice dropped slightly. "I won't be there to watch your back this time."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I'll be fine," Vertigo assured him, swinging the duffel over his shoulder. "Commander wouldn't send me if he didn't think I could handle it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That's..." Nathan started, then seemed to think better of it. Instead, he grabbed a forgotten shirt from the bed and handed it to Vertigo. "Just come back in one piece, okay?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo crammed the shirt into a side pocket of the bag. "What, worried you'll have to listen to Bliss complain if I don't?" he joked.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Nathan's smile didn't quite reach his eyes. "Something like that."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo trudged down the stairs, bag over his shoulder, Nathan following behind, continuing to narrate his exploits. Despite himself, a real smile quirked at the corner of his mouth. He'd miss this quiet banter, not that he'd ever admit it aloud.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Appearing to gather his courage, Nathan stepped forward and wrapped Vertigo in a quick, awkward embrace. "Don't do anything I wouldn't do."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Surprised by the gesture, Vertigo stood frozen for a moment before giving Nathan's back a single, gruff pat. "That doesn't narrow it down much," he joked, pulling away and adjusting his sword belt to hide his discomfort with the unexpected display of affection.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You know what I mean," Nathan said quietly, stepping back and shoving his hands into his pockets. His eyes held Vertigo's for a beat longer than usual before he looked away.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo nodded. "I'll see you when this is over," he promised.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He turned and walked out, leaving Nathan standing at the foot of the stairs.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>

 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “This could really kill Commander's reputation,” Vertigo said, studying the hastily drawn map Bliss had spread out. “He keeps putting out how he won't deal with slavers, but this comes out, he looks like a hypocrite. Worse than that, they'll see it as us stealing business. Never mind it's not true, you know as well as I do there's people who are gonna jump at tearing him down. Tearing us down.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Bliss just snorted, crossing her arms over her chest. “You do your part, an' I'll do mine, it won't get out. Clean an' fast, remember?” She bent over the map of Yolanda's territory. “This ain't great, but it's what we've got to work with. When you figure out where the blackmail is, draw the signal on the south wall of this building.” She tapped the paper with a chipped fingernail.

   “Got it. Who's our eyes?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Dunno her name, but that kid from the Sol Merino job'll be watching you. She's steady, no trouble.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo nodded. “Good enough for me.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Bliss huffed a soft laugh. “Had t'talk Commander into her over Rafe, that useless load. Just 'cause he's a suckup don't make him good for anything.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Studying the map once more, Vertigo asked, “So what's the next step?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Kid'll bump into you, pass her the intel. I'll make my move next night. Commander's got other eyes in the city so by then we'll have her security figured. After that...” Bliss shrugged. “Commander wants her whole slave operation ashed.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo eyed her. “You're looking for some revenge, aren't you?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A grin cracked her face. “I won't be cryin', that's for sure.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Hoisting his bag over his shoulder he tipped Bliss a sardonic salute. Taking slow, deep breaths to calm his racing pulse, he left the inn and walked through the city. As usual before an operation adrenaline hummed through his nerves but he needed to be able to think clearly. This wasn’t a simple raid; he was walking into enemy territory to take on a dangerous role. There were eyes on him, no surprise there, but he did his best to control the instincts that screamed to take out the threat. As he reached the meeting point his face broke out into a grin as he saw the guards on duty. Ugly, looking worse for wear, was one of them and did not look happy to see him.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Hey, how's it goin',” Vertigo threw out cheerfully as he passed. “I'd stay and chat but I've got important business with the Chief, you know?” He took pleasure in reminding the man of his failure, exposing an easy weakness that would cost Vertigo nothing to exploit.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The man's bruised face darkened in anger and he made as if to take a step forward before he thought better of it. Vertigo chuckled silently to himself and stepped inside the building.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Far from the stripped down neutral ground of the warehouse, this was the heart of Yolanda's operations. This part of the city was hers, and everyone here knew it. The building had probably been an inn or tavern in a past life but was now a command center. Vertigo knew better than to think anything important would be lying out for him to see but he passed a casual gaze over maps and documents as he passed anyway.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dominique met him halfway across the room, a smug fox smile on her pale face. “Welcome to the family,” she purred.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo slouched insouciantly, hands deep in his pockets. “Look, I'm here, and I'll follow orders, but you're not my mommy.” Better to play it real than to overtip his hand.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She chuckled, sounding genuine. “That poor woman. I can only imagine.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Yeah, well, she's dead, so I wouldn't worry too much about it.” He tipped his head toward the back rooms. “Let's get it over with, shall we?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dominique smiled again, the expression not quite reaching her eyes. She was similar to Bliss in that respect, cold, knowing green eyes that saw everything but revealed little. She led him down through several corridors and buildings to a long barracks that was cramped even in the absence of other people. “You'll earn a private room just like everyone else,” she said in response to Vertigo's quirked eyebrow. “You're not special just because you're a walking weapon.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo shrugged but inwardly his stomach roiled at how little privacy he'd be granted. He'd always counted on a quiet spot to retreat to when the world got to be too much and in an unfamiliar space he'd be needing that respite more than ever.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Taking a deep breath, he tried to quell his unease. The barracks were stifling, the air thick with the scent of sweat, dirt, and something acrid that clung to the back of his throat. The thought of being in such close quarters with Yolanda's crew made his skin crawl. Dominique left him to get settled without so much as a backward glance, and as soon as she was out of sight Vertigo made a quick scan of the room.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   There wasn't much to see: narrow bunks lined the walls, each with a threadbare blanket and a lumpy pillow. The walls were bare, save for a few hooks where the previous occupants had hung their meager belongings. He spotted a few lockers at the far end, most likely holding whatever personal items the others had stored.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Not much of a welcome party,” he muttered to himself. He dropped his bag onto one of the empty bunks and sat down, the springs digging into his backside through the thin mattress. He’d have to bide his time, wait for the right moment. As much as he hated the thought of playing the obedient pawn in this twisted game, he had to see it through.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The door creaked open and Vertigo tensed. A young girl, no more than twelve or thirteen, slipped inside. She was small and wiry, with a dirty hat sitting on top of her short, cropped mouse-brown hair and a wary look in her eyes. She glanced around the room, her gaze landing on Vertigo.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “You’re the new guy, right?” she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Yeah,” Vertigo replied, keeping his tone light. “Who’s asking?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “They call me Rat,” she said, her eyes flicking to the door and back. “I’m supposed to keep an eye on you, make sure you don’t do anything stupid.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo raised an eyebrow. “They sent a kid to babysit me?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She scowled, a flash of anger crossing her face. “I’m not a kid. I been working for Chief longer than you’ve been around. I'm also your best shot at getting out.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   That caught his attention. “Out?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Rat nodded. “I know this place better than anyone. If things go south, I can get you out of here before anyone even knows you’re gone.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “What do you mean?” he asked casually.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “I told you I'm not a kid.” She crossed her skinny arms over her chest. “I know why you're here and I wanna help. Don't play stupid with me, I heard the whole thing. 'Commander wants the whole slave operation ashed.'” She did a passable mimicry of Bliss. “I want in.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He narrowed his eyes. “Why help me? What’s in it for you?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Rat’s expression darkened. “Let’s just say I’ve got my own reasons for wanting to see Yolanda go down. And you’re my best shot at making that happen.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo studied her for a moment, trying to gauge if she was telling the truth or trying to trap him. There was something in her eyes, a genuine hatred that made him believe her. If she intended to double cross him, she'd already had plenty of opportunity to alert Yolanda. “Alright, Rat,” he said slowly. “What’s the plan?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She shook her head. “Not yet. Chief wants to see you, sent me to get you. But when the time comes, I’ll be ready.” She scrubbed at her nose with the back of her hand. “Let's go.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo hesitated. Things had just gotten a lot more complicated, but if Rat was telling the truth, she might be the ally he needed to help pull this off. For now, all he could do was wait and see how things played out. He strode out the barracks door after Rat without looking back.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Yolanda’s office was in stark contrast to the rest of the compound. Plush carpets, fine wooden furniture, and the soft glow of oil lamps set an almost cozy atmosphere, at odds with the ruthlessness he knew she was capable of. She sat behind a large desk, her fingers steepled as she watched Vertigo approach. Dominique stood at her side, her eyes flicking between Vertigo and Yolanda with a knowing smirk.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “So, you’re the infamous Vertigo,” Yolanda began, her voice smooth but laced with steel. “Commander speaks highly of you - though not highly enough to prevent you from being sent here. I wonder what that says about his loyalty.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo forced a grin, masking the churn of anxiety in his gut. “Loyalty’s a tricky thing. I go where I’m needed, and right now, that’s here.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Yolanda raised an eyebrow, clearly unimpressed. “We’ll see if you can be of any use to me. Loyalty is earned, and if you want to survive here, you’ll have to prove yours.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She leaned back in her chair, her eyes narrowing. “There’s a job I need done. It’s not glamorous, but it’ll give me an idea of where you stand. I need someone to collect a shipment from the docks tonight. Routine, but I want it done quietly. No mistakes. Rat will accompany you.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo wasn't fooled for a second. The docks at night? Quiet, routine job? It reeked of a setup, a test to see if he’d fold under pressure or, worse, a trap to catch him out as a spy. “Understood,” he replied, trying to keep his tone neutral.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Yolanda’s gaze lingered on him for a moment longer, holding eye contact. He stared right back, unwilling to back down, the lamplight flickering in her dark eyes. Time stretched to the snapping point, until she dismissed him abruptly with a wave. “Don’t disappoint me.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As Vertigo turned to leave, a strange sensation washed over him, a feeling of absolute dedication to Yolanda's cause, a desperate need to please her. He stumbled slightly, disoriented. This was going to be an important mission and he couldn’t disappoint Yolanda.
  </span>
 </p>
