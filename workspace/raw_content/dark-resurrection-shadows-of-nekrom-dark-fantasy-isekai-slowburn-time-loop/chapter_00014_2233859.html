<p class="cnNiYjU5NTIwYTc5ZjQ5MDhhYjg2MjdhMjUzNWY2MGIy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em">The tales Lucahn told her were closely related to the Three Aspects that influenced Nekrom's designs. Whether through thaumaturgy —the ability to apply magic in a practical way— or supernatural abilities granted to certain individuals called Divinities, the gods were always there, moving their chess pieces behind the scenes.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZWE2MWZkYTZjZDQyMzM4YjEzZGUyYjNjNmQ2Y2Ni"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em">For Tristessa, given the very limited experiences she remembered from her life on Earth and the common sense that prevailed there, everything the boy was reading to her should have been pure fiction; tales drawn from the imaginations of people who never expected their words to endure for centuries.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YjM0NTczYjY2ZTQzNGNiZjAzMjVhOWMzNGM0ZTRk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em">However, in Nekrom, reality surpassed fiction. Tristessa already knew the influence of the divided Aspects of Nekronomika. She knew it, she felt it in her recomposed soul, manipulated by beings from the immaterial world.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYzQzNmUwOWQyNTQyMzQ5MTgxODg4OGNjZWY0NDAx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em">She was a believer from the first moment she set foot in that world, and even more so when she died and came back to life.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMzg1Mjg3NjVlMzQ1YzM5NWE0YWQ3N2E1ZTJmYjk5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em">“…<em>and that was how the Dark Tower collapsed, leaving the alchemist Sarjoule with the lesson that there are forces in the world that men and women are not ready to control, and never will be</em>.” Lucahn finished reading the story, more than happy for the attention Tristessa was giving him but equally tired of talking so much. He took a sip of water, removing the dryness from his lips that had not been so busy for a long while. “Do you want me to continue, miss?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTA4YmMwNmM2YTQ0Y2FhYjRlYTZhNzA2YTdjMzI4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em">“If you want. I'm not going to force you, Luc… Wait, wait!” the girl exclaimed, forcing the startled boy to turn two pages back. “What is this...?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MzE3Mzg5NTNiMjQxOWFhNTBmZjkzMGVhY2FhMDk2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em">“Oh, it's the story of Endrel and Margules. It's a boring love story...” Lucahn complained, puffing out his cheeks and frowning at Tristessa's astonished look. “Do you know it?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZWFmZmZlOTJiMjQ4MTlhMGQwNDk3ZWRkOTIwYTll"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em">The black-haired girl was in shock: the illustration that accompanied the text in glyphs was of two women, one wearing a revealing robe and snuggling passionately against the chest of the other, who was naked and had two black, angelic wings on her back.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZTNiZWJhZTFmMTQyM2Y5ZjkxODVmZWZlNGY0MjA0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em">But the most curious —and dreadful— thing was that both women were holding on to a single golden chain, connected to a portal whose access was completely blocked by it.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZTYwNmI1ODdhYTQ4NGZiMDVmMTQxODdmMzY5ZWJk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em">“No... I don't know the story,” she whispered, as the tickling in her shoulders intensified and the anxiety became unbearable. “Can you read it to me? Please!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDcxZTk5Mzk0OTQxN2Q4NGNlN2E2OGEzNDI3MDUx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em">“Uh, daddy taught me that I can't refuse the request of a lady I like! Okay...” said the boy, sighing. “But then let's go play with Gaal, okay? He's my dog!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNjlmYjhjMWMxNzQ0MTlhM2U4MmE0ZTk2N2VmZTc5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em">Lucahn took a breath and began.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OGUwZmRiMTk4MDRhY2ZiYTA5YTQyNjE1MTczNTRl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em">“<em>A fair woman named Margules lost almost everything in one night. The ring of Red Hood assassins invaded her home, burned it down and killed her husband. She managed to escape and took refuge in the local lord's abbey, keeping in her possession only the baby growing in her womb.</em></span></p>
<p class="cnNjMTQ0OTEzM2RhNDRkN2ZiM2ZlNjFlNzhkMzMxOWRk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em"><em>Unfortunately, the baby was stillborn. And Margules despaired. She prayed with all her might to the three gods and all their angels to bring her son back to life, but no one answered to her pain.</em></span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzEzN2JhODZmMDRlZmY4YzIyNDVlNDk3NGMxMTdk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em"><em>She prayed day and night, never letting go of her baby's cold body. Until from the heavens descended the most beautiful woman ever seen, with wings as black as night and surrounded by chains of gold, and said to Margules:</em></span></p>
<p class="cnM1MTczMzU2YzY2MDRlYTZhMzAyZDE0Yjc1OTRmNGYw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em"><em>“I am Endrel, Angel of Rebirth.

<p class="cnNjOGNiYTEwYzZlMjRiMDk5NjVlZDA2ZTNhM2JmM2Uz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em"><em>And Margules asked her: “And what has been His judgment, oh divine heavenly messenger?”</em></span></p>
<p class="cnM1ODBiMGMwMTU1ZjQ5YjJhYTgwMjM1NjY0M2I3OTQx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em"><em>And Endrel answered: “The will of my lord and master is absolute. As Angel of Rebirth, I can bring your son back to life, but there is a very high price for you to pay.”</em></span></p>
<p class="cnMwNTRjYWEwMDQ4YjRiZjU5Njc5OTk2MzgyNTUxNGMx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em"><em>And Margules said to her: “Anything, oh holy lady! I will give you anything for a miracle that will give life back to my son, so cruelly taken from me! I will give you my soul, my heart and my eternal love!”</em></span></p>
<p class="cnMxMjdkOWFhYzRkYjRhMjVhYTQ1ZTgyYTg0ZTFlNGE0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em"><em>And Endrel said to her: “Then hear my demands. You shall make me known. Let the people of your village revere me. Make them pray with every birth and every death, in my name and the name of my master. Let my name bring comfort in death and hope in new life. And you, Margules, when you have no more strength to utter words of love to me, when your body collapses and your soul trembles at the inevitable end, like everything that sails the turbulent waters called time and Chaos, I will come for you and you will be my Chosen Consort, until the end of time.”</em></span></p>
<p class="cnMzNzk0MGYyZTljODRjMDc5YTg1Njg3OTYzZmRjMjAx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em"><em>Endrel breathed life into the face of the unborn child and returned to the heavens. The child opened its eyes and its cries filled the abbey. Margules cried, gave her child all the love a mother can give, and kept her word.</em></span></p>
<p class="cnMwZDhlMmYzOGVhNzQzMjZiNDZjODFhNTE2ZmQ5MDZh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em"><em>With every denying priest, Margules convinced them of Endrel’s love.</em></span></p>

<p class="cnNjZjA5NTE4MWMyNzQzYTRiMzExNjAxMjczYzk4ZTM1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em"><em>And the Angel of Rebirth came to her side, captured her fluttering soul and blew divine air into its essence.</em></span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZjgyZTE2ZWE2MjQ1ZmFiOGVhYmFjOWUxZGNmZjQ4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em"><em>And Margules ascended among the souls of mortals.</em></span></p>

<p class="cnNkNzdlMDJjMDcyZDRhM2Y4ZmQzNjliMjM1ZTY3NTNm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em"><em>But Margules told her: “Immaculate lady, loving you is not a punishment if it is a blessing. Loving you is priceless if it is a gift. Loving you is not deference if it comes from the very core of my soul.”</em></span></p>
<p class="cnM1MzQ5NWZlZWEyZjQzZmZiMzU2NjVjMzRmMDBhNDUx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em"><em>Margules took Endrel’s Golden Chains and wrapped herself with them, joining with the angel, embracing the angel and fixing her loving gaze on the angel’s divine face.</em></span></p>

<p class="cnM5NDJhMDc5MjYzNTQ0OGM5NTBiNjJmZDAwYjQ3OGZh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em">Lucahn finished reading the tale and let out a deep yawn, totally ignoring the look of concern that dominated Tristessa’s face.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NDNjY2M1NzhmNzRlZWRhN2Q3ZTJiMWRkOWRlYzll"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em">The tale was meant to be a sort of religious romance, but for the girl, it had been chillingly revealing information. Along with everything she learned about the Gods, about what she experienced with Darkness, the concept of Discord that seemed so natural to her despite never even having heard the word out loud.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZTUyYTFhMGU2NDQ3MDE5NmFiNzA1YWRlY2JjNDQz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em">The In-Between and its inhabitants, their identities now revealed. Endrel and Margules, the guardians of the Infinite Corridor. The Angel of Rebirth and her consort, pulling on the chains to perpetuate the corridor's eternal loop, moaning in pleasure as their hybrid bodies of rotting flesh, gears, and miasma of Discord rubbed against each other…</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YWNmM2ZjNmM1YjRlYWRiNzg5MjYxZDhmMmY3YTRm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em">Tristessa saw the tale's representation, them immortalized as two beautiful lovers in transcendence, when reality showed two monstrous creatures, worthy of nightmares.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZDQ0NmQ1MTA2ZTQzMGY4N2I5ZmQ1ODcwOTIyNTY0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em">“<em>They are to blame for…for this</em>,” the girl thought, bringing a hand to her chest. Behind her white shirt, her heart beat against her Baptism in Ruins, the unholy mark that evidenced broken laws that were not to be violated. “Them…and Vel’Moran…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTM3ZjNhZDRiNzRiMWM5ZDcwNjFkZTk4ZTZhMWRi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em">The name of the God of Chaos echoed in her head, his titanic shadow growing ever more present.</span></p>
