<p class="cnNhODUwNTc3Y2UwMDQ1YjZhZTE2ODMwZDM0ZjQyOWI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">The team quickly shuffled around, pulling an extra chair over for Terrance to join them. Maeryn had so many questions she wanted to ask, but the most important one was, “Where’ve you been?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmYWQ1ZTcyODMzODRhZGFhMjdmMGM5MDc5NTE2NzI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance, who had been studying Ernesto curiously, turned to face Maeryn directly, his face turning serious. “I’ve been navigating the dark side of Airspire. It took a while to earn enough trust to actually get anywhere, but considering my skillset, it was just a matter of time. Sorry I didn’t reach out before; I was being watched </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">really </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">closely.” He leaned across the table and lowered his voice. “There’s something rotten in the city, Maeryn. I’m sure of it.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiMzQ5MzYzODE4ZTRiOTJhZDUzM2VmZDUyNjlhMTU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn took a deep breath, then gave a small nod. “Okay. Talk to me. What’s going on?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmODlmOGVlNTVjMTRmMmU4MTk3ODA3ZjYwMjczZDFl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Airspire’s supposed to be the greatest city when it comes to research, right? Home to the greatest minds Zephyria has to offer. But ‘great’ doesn’t always mean ‘good’, when it comes to research. I was digging into the various research teams to see what was going on, following a few around to their facilities to see how honest they were being, when I discovered a hidden facility in the bedrock of Airspire. I couldn’t get in, but I swear to you Maeryn, on the World’s Breath, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">there was Mist coming out that door!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1N2RlMzhkODZmNDRhMTU5ZWM2MzYxNThhOTU3YzIz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Empty night,” Ernesto breathed. “Maeryn, the Mist…!” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzYTY2YWVlMzI0ZTRkNmU4ZDE1NWZiNTA0MmM1MzBm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, I know.” Maeryn closed her eyes. “That means Undead.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3MDlkMWVlYjhiNTQ0ZDY5NmE0ZjI4NzI4ZjUzZWE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait, what?!” Terrance yelped. “What do you mean by that?!” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmYmMyNDg1ZDcxYzQ0NzBiZDU3ZjAyMjYxYjQ0ZWZm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Guess it’s my turn to fill you in on what we’ve been up to.” Maeryn sighed. She quickly assessed her surroundings and lowered her voice to a hush just in case. “Long story short, we found one of, if not the leading, causes of the Mist. Turns out that it’s generated by living creatures at the border of life and death. The Undead, being perpetually in that state, constantly generate the Mist. I’ve seen it myself.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNkYjY4ZWY0MzEyYTQ0M2M5ZTczY2FkMWZiYzU5Y2M1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance froze in place, eyes darting between everyone else. At their solemn nods, he slumped into his chair. “Still wind and empty night, this is a lot worse than I thought. We’re dealing with necromancers?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM4OWMxYjg1NzhkYjQwYTU5NmJiMTYyMThlYWI1MjYw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Unknown,” Maeryn said shortly. “It’s possible that we’re dealing with very old Undead from before necromancy was banned in Geova and Zephyria, but it’s equally possible we have rogue agents. And, it might also be possible that one or more of your research teams has recruited a necromancer for their research.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZTE1OWNjNGIwMzRjOTRhZDk2ZDQ0OTM1ODJjMmVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto looked at Maeryn questioningly, wordlessly asking if he should reveal himself to Terrance. She shook her head very, very slightly, and he swallowed, keeping his mouth firmly shut. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDQ3NGYzNGM5YTRlOTNiMGZlMjhiMmU4MTI0Yzcw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That said,” Maeryn continued, “the presence of the Mist coming out of the facility means that someone has raised an Undead on Airspire, which is an incredible health and safety hazard. I don’t like this, not one bit.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZWNhMmZiNmRjMDQwOTRhYzMxZjIyOGNlNDgxNjYz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Me neither,” Terrance muttered wholeheartedly. “Listen. Maeryn, when we last spoke, I told you that I was looking for the team that had made the most progress. Just now, you proved unequivocally that’s you. Is that offer still there for me to join up?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM4NzBmZTk0OGFlYTRhZjVhMmU1ZjA4Y2RlMmNhMjUy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn looked at him intently, then gave him a short nod, smiling slightly at him. “Glad to have you back.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZTYzYjEyMWQ3MDQ2NmZhZjJhMGRkZmJkYzdiY2Mz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Glad to be back.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZDU5NmMwNGE0YzQ0ZDE4NzlkN2RhZmZlZGYzMzg1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Welcome to our pirate crew!” Frankie welcomed him, shooting a look full of smug amusement at Maeryn as her smile froze on her face. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTY3MmYzNzk3OTQyNmM4Yjc3ZDU5NTgzYzU5ZDIz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance paused. “Pirate crew?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhMjYzYzdlYTg2MDQ5MThhNmEzZDUxNjIwZjVmODQz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Frankie…” Maeryn moaned piteously even as Dan began chuckling. Why was she friends with these two again? “Don’t do this. Please.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM4N2RiMGJmZjdmNzQxYWRhZGQ3YTdhMzY1NjMyY2I0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know my price, Pirate Captain Maeryn.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhNmNiMGNhZjhmMDQ5NmU5ZjgxMGM5Mzg0Njc0ODc5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Much to Maeryn’s mortal embarrassment, Terrance was starting to grin. “I have got to hear this story.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiMTYxODFjYzQ4YTQ2NjY5Y2RhMmQ2OTRkOTM2NDc1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Not seeing any other option, Maeryn reluctantly went up to her room to escape the conversation, coming back wearing the damned hat. Frankie cheered quietly on seeing it, and Terrance was visibly holding back laughter. Maeryn could feel her dignity shriveling with each passing second, and her face was going to burst into flames. Possibly literally, if she started channeling any mana. She stomped back over the table and ripped the hat from her head the moment she sat back down, casting a glare at everyone before landing on Terrance. “Not. One. Word.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlYTBkZDk0ZTI5ZDQ3YmJiNDQ3N2IyZWQyYTQ0NjAx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Me? I would never dream of it, Pir - I mean, Captain Maeryn.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyMjdiNDdmOTJhMzRjYjRhMjhmYzRjOGVkMjA5ZDA1"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Geovan stared at him for several long seconds before sighing. “Right. Can we get back on topic now, please?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyOGZjYjA5NWJkMjQ0MTZhNmI4ODUwMzFlNzc2OTAy"><span style="font-weight: 400">That sobered up her companions, and Terrance leaned across the table. “Right, the Undead situation. So, what’s the plan?” </span></p><span class="cjVjY2RmMWZkMmJmYzRlYTRhOTE4Y2U1YzcwYmYxOGUx"><br/>Stolen content alert: this content belongs on Royal Road. Report any occurrences.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNmOTNkYmM3NDc2NzQ3ODRhMzIxNzk2N2RhNzc1MDJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn leaned back, mind whirling. “We can’t ignore the facility. If an Undead is let loose in the city, even by accident, there’ll be unimaginable losses. If Mist came out of that door, I have some serious concerns about containment, too. It needs to take priority,” she thought aloud, gaining nods from everyone at the table. “But we also can’t ignore the contracts I’ve taken. I think… I think we need to split up. Frankie, can you and Dan take the family to and from Mount Peace tomorrow?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MDdmZmMwNzdlNjQ0ZTA5NmUxNjFhZGY1ZTk4Mzcy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No problem,” Frankie agreed, thumping her chest confidently. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwNzA0NjA5MWZiZTRkZDI5NmIzNjkwYWZhNDEzMjhl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good. Dan’s in charge in my absence. There shouldn’t be anything dangerous there after our last visit. Stay on high alert, though, just in case. Dan, make sure you’re prepared with fire in case of the worst.” The alchemist nodded solemnly, hands reaching to pat his many pockets, no doubt thinking of some concoction he could cook up. “Come straight back to Airspire when you’re done, and meet me here in </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Dancing Dragonflies.</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">” </span></p>
<p class="cnM1OTZlNjQ4NzZlZjRkNzRiYzQyZTYxNzQ2NjgxNzMx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn then turned towards Ernesto and Terrance. “The three of us will investigate the hidden facility, and if it comes down to it, kill the Undead. Ernesto, look through your Compendium tonight, see if you have anything that might help. Terrance, we’ll be relying on you to get us in.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMxZTIyMDM4MTc2NTQ5YjZiZGI2M2U3MzhkNzBlZDJk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Leave it to me,” the rogue agreed.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOTIyYTAzY2IxNjQ2MmJhZmYzOGJhYmZmNzUwMjhk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto merely nodded, his jaw set even though his eyes betrayed his nervousness. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjZDA2NWUzZmU0ZDQ4YjhiNDUyZWY1M2UxMDJlZWNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay, people. Remember, this is an investigation mission. If it turns out the facility is actually equipped to handle the Undead and they’re just doing some research on the Mist, that’s not something we want to interrupt. We only kill the Undead in self-defense, or if it’s clear that the facility can’t hold them long-term. Are we clear?” Maeryn looked between Ernesto and Terrance, who both nodded determinedly. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyOWUxZTFjZGU1NjQ2OTg5YWJlYjgwYTVmNTdmNTU4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Got it.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5NmRmMTg3MWM2NDQ4MzhiMmQ2M2E1ZWM0Nzc5NDJj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good.” Maeryn relaxed, and the tension at the table slowly fell away. “Let’s finish our food and get some rest, then. Our day tomorrow is looking longer than expected.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOWZkYTczZmU0MTQ4NTRiMzg4MDJlYjVhYmQ3MGJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a general grumble of agreement, and everyone dug into their food. Terrance ordered a bowl of stew from Gerald, who delivered it in a matter of minutes, allowing him to eat with the others. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiMThkMzljY2Q0YTRlZWM5YWE4OTYxMTUyZGNkOWY3"><span style="font-weight: 400">An hour later, as everyone started to head upstairs to their rooms, Terrance lightly touched Maeryn’s arm, getting her attention. “Hey, can we talk for a minute?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzMmQ0MWUyMWFlZDQ3M2VhMzE4MjJiNjBmNTM0YWIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, sure.” Maeryn followed him outside, and noted that while it was getting dark, twilight still lit the streets enough to see decently. There were a few people here and there, walking home from wherever they’d been, but they paid Maeryn and Terrance no attention at all as they ducked into an alley between two buildings. “What’s on your mind?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YzIwNTk5OTI0MDRjNjhiMzJkOTRiODI5YzFmOGMw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t put my finger on it, but… I get the feeling that there’s something you were holding back, earlier.” Terrance frowned uncertainly. “Call it a gut feeling, I guess. If you tell me I’m imagining things, I’ll trust you. But… am I?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzZmQ0M2Q4MTY5NjQzNzA5MzdjMWYxYjJmYTAyZmJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn sighed, finding herself unwilling to lie to him. It just wasn’t a good idea to lie to someone you needed to have mutual trust in. “You’re not imagining things,” she replied softly. “It’s just not something best discussed in public. I’m sure you’re smart enough to put it together, though. Think about it. I said that I saw an Undead producing Mist. How could I have managed that?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiOThlZjdlNDEwNTRmNDc5NjQzZmI4NTc2MjRjNmEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance stilled, his eyes narrowing as he put the clues together. “You’ve fought an Undead. Which means you’ve encountered a necromancer. You’re not one, Frankie’s not one, Dan’s not one… but Ernesto’s new. Is he…?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkN2Q4YWE4NTRiYjQzZjZhYjEzY2ViZDQyOWQzOWM0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“He’s not the one who raised it,” Maeryn asserted firmly, keeping her voice low even as she stared intently at him. “He has zero desire to use his magic that way. He doesn’t even know a spell to do that.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM2Yjg2OGFhYmIxMzQxOWRhZDBiMTJlNzkwOTk4ODNm"><span style="font-weight: 400">The rogue’s face twitched through a number of emotions, too quick for Maeryn to catch them all. But she did see fear and disbelief in the mix. “How does he want to use his magic, then?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYmExZDc1M2MzYTQ0NTJiM2VhYzMzNzU5NDc3Njlm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“He makes cheese.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5N2VhNjI1ZWMyYjQ2OGRhZjA4NDQ0ZDExOWM0NmUx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?” Terrance blinked. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxYjViMWY1MWNjYTRkYjY5YmE2NGRhYjA4NDRkYWJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Apparently necromantic mana is good for fermenting cheese.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjg0N2Y0YTk1OTRmOWRiYmU3MzQwOTNlZDhkMDE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry, what? He… he makes cheese?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiZGM0M2M1ZTQ5MDQzZDk4NmE0OWUxOTk2MzdhYTBk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“He makes cheese,” Maeryn repeated, her lips tugging upwards. Terrance’s answering expression looked so utterly baffled and lost that Maeryn couldn’t help the snort of laughter that escaped her. “Listen. Ernesto has no interest in raising the dead. He’s more focused on trying to find ways to use necromancy for quality of life improvements.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzM2QyZmNkM2U1NzQ5YTBhOTZjNjMyMGY2NTMwZDIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn went on to explain the circumstances behind Research Master Graves’s death, and the team’s plan to create inverted necromantic mana in order to purify the Mist. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiYzE1YWVkYmM3YzRiMGY4OTY5MzJiODQzYTYxYzg4"><span style="font-weight: 400">By the end, Terrance was nodding in understanding, though he still wore a terrible frown, and his arms were crossed in frustration. “Your plan makes sense, but I don’t know how much I’d trust a necromancer, benevolent or not.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhNjUxM2I3MWVmOTQ3ZmI4NDhlMWFhNzg1ODRiMDAz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“If he turns on us, we’ll take him down,” Maeryn assured him simply. “But I’ve seen him. Watched him. He’s more anxious than a mouse, and I watched him say goodbye to his Master. I’m confident he’s exactly who he says he is, and that he wants the Mist gone as much as we do. After all, it killed his mentor.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwOGZlYWNjNGQ3NjRlZmI5NTczNDRhZTllZDI0MWZm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There… there is some truth to that.” Terrance sighed, uncrossing his arms and untensing. “I don’t like it. I understand it, but I don’t like it. I’ll be watching him carefully.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0NTA2ZjI1NzQzYjRmNWZiNmRhMzg3ZTlmMTg0Zjdi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn nodded, knowing perfectly well that there was nothing she could say to change his mind. He’d see for himself soon enough. “Do what you have to do, but remember to give him the benefit of the doubt. Besides, you’ll be seeing how he does tomorrow anyway.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzZTkxOGY4ZDBlMTQ2ZGE5MTA5YjIzNTcxY2QyNWVm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There is that,” Terrance agreed thoughtfully. “Alright. I’ll leave it at that, then. And Maeryn?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDYzYzM0OTYyMTQ1YTVhYzY0NTcwMTE4NjExMzlh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOTY3ZTZjNjA2MzQzYjI5MDA2Yzk4YjAzYzE1NTA3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance looked her dead in the eyes, his gaze intense. “Thank you for trusting me. I know it can’t have been easy, considering how I just dropped in and out of your life without a word. I really do appreciate it.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYTUzNDkzZTQzYzQyY2ViM2Y5ZGExZGZjN2I5MjEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn looked back at him, her face serious, then she nodded her head once, accepting his thanks. “Try not to pull too many vanishing acts in the future.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3N2E5ODFkNGI1YzQzNDBhNzY0MWJkMDYzM2NkNDJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, I can’t promise that, but I’ll do my best to keep you informed when I do.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmOWNjN2FlMDk0NzQ3ZDA4YjEzNDQ4YWEzZDJkMGE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn chuckled and shoved Terrance gently, just enough to show her mild exasperation and amusement. “Good enough.” </span></p>
