<p class="cnM2MzU0NjNlZjZhMTQyYzU4MDkyNmVmODVkZjA4MGY0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><span style="font-size: 1.5em"><strong>B</strong></span>eeping sounds and the smell of antiseptics woke Lorna Weiss up. Her eyes opened to a dim hospital room in morning light. Tubes ran from her arm to an IV stand beside her bed. She tried to sit up but got dizzy and fell back onto the pillow.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMzdkOTBhNDI0ZTRjMDc4YTU5NDViOGEyMTZkNTJk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Nearby, Zhi-Xin Wu sat in a steel chair. His fingers typed on his Quantum Watch, green light glowing on his face.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyY2IzYTA4M2IwODQ5MGU5ZjQ2ZTNkNWEwMmIyODcz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Through her blurry vision, Lorna could see text floating above the watch, reflected in a small mirror behind Xin:</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ODZkMTIwNmM3ZjRhNjk4MmYwZmUyYjBlNjRiZDA5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">'Fenris strain cure'</span></p>

<p class="cnM1MDliN2ZlMzVmNzQ5ZDM4MzQzZjlmNWRiZDcwZjBl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">'Racial/ethnic differences in body language &amp; eating habits: Valoran, Nordling, Djinno, Imperial, Novian'</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOGYxMjlmNzEyNzRkZDViNWU0ZjUzY2RhYjBiMWMx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">'Valoran female / Imperial male dating: Hurdles to overcome'</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOTYwYjg3MDkwMTQzZGRhNTkxODg3ZTQxOTcxZmNh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The last searches made her chuckle softly.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxODg3ODQyMjNhMDRhOWFiOTRiZTk5OTE5ZTQ3YTk5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin noticed, his eyes widened and he quickly turned off his watch.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZTRiZWIxMTYyYTQ1NjI5NDI0NDYyMThmZmM3ZTkx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Lorna…you're awake," he stammered as he stood up. His hand reached out to touch hers, hesitated, then gently took her fingers. "How do you feel? Are you okay?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZWIxMDE0YTRjMTQ0Njg4NmM0YmIyMTc5MmM1YTNl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She noticed how different they looked. She wore a plain white hospital gown with her blonde hair loose, while Xin looked neat in his dark green hoodie and black pants.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNmM2YzAxZDIxZDQ2ODI5NWM0ZWRlM2JiMWRmZTFk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna licked her dry lips. "Water," she croaked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NDI0NGFkOGU2MDRhNzRiMzFhNjNjYzAzM2U2OWRm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Of course," Xin got up smoothly. He went to a panel beside her bed and pressed some buttons. The panel produced a glass of water.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MzVjY2VhYjhhNDQwYjM4MGEzZDg4MDc4YjMxOTVl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I would add lemon juice, but maybe next time?" he said as he handed her the glass.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NDY4ZDg5MWY4YzRjNGFiZGJiNTI1Yzc5ZjcyMjA4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Hmph," Sitting up, she took the glass with a nod, her fingers briefly touching his. She drank the cool water.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMzkyNGZkYjcwNTQ4YjZhN2RjODYyZDU0OWZkMGNk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As she drank, she watched him, noticing his clenched jaw and how his eyes lingered on her before looking away.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhODMzZmFiMzU3MDQ3Yjc5YTUzZjcwNTNiZjkxNTM0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Thanks," she said, putting the glass down and looking around the room. "How long was I out?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MzRlZWI2MmY0YTRlODI4N2RiOTlkYTA3NDczOTkz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Well, let's see," Xin leaned back, tapping his leg. "You've missed exactly two sunrises, one rainy morning, one full moon, and an entire season of 'Galactic Gladiators' reruns." He grinned and showed her his green watch. "But don't worry, I recorded the highlights for you."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNjRmMjM5ZDgyNzRlNDc4MGQ3N2U3N2FhNjUxNGQ3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She smiled, despite feeling tired. "So, four days then?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NDEwOTE3NjBjOTRlZTU5ZGI2OWMxMjRmMzUxNGVl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yeah," he nodded. "And in those four days, Diego has given me the promised compensation — plus a few things to upgrade my gear and build a small project."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MmE2Mzg3YzIzMjQ0YmNhNmMwMTVmNjdkOTc0ZDEz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"What kind of project?" she asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYmJmOTEyMzY4NTRiNjhhOGYyMzE2NzQ4Mjc4NTU3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The kind that'll help with the upcoming mission," he tilted his head.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjU3YzhhOGU3NDQ5MWY4MmQ2YTM2OWNiMmI0ZDM2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"So they let you become one of us without asking me first, huh?" she joked, careful not to move too much with the IV in her wrist.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYThiYWE5ZTk5ZjQ1OTU4MGJlZDAyMzViYjI2MzRj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Wouldn't want to put too much pressure on you, am I right?" Xin said, relaxing in his chair.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyN2YzYTg3ZmM0MzQ5MmY5NGI0YjJlNjk0M2E1MjY3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You saying I missed all the fun?" She replied, half-joking.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwN2ZkZjc1NjFkMjQxMWRiYzA3MjU3YzYzNGU1NmYy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Define 'fun'," Xin smiled.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZGI4M2RjMzNmZjQ1MjI4ZjBjNWFlN2JmMWM4YWY1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Anything that doesn't involve being hooked to machines," Lorna shot back.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiN2FlYWMxOWY3MTRhMmVhNjRjNWQxZWFhOWViNmM1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Then by that definition," he said, looking into her eyes, "you haven't missed a thing."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMjY4MTI5MzIwMDQ5YWJhMjgxNjRiMDQ1YTMxMjRi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Right." She could still feel her dream, making the hospital room seem unreal. She found herself studying Xin's face - so different from the Nordic features from her homeland. His olive skin, dark eyes, and slight accent in his careful English.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MWUwZDcwNTM4ZDQ2N2U5OTk0ZDAxMGZhYTZhNWI1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You seem lost in thought," Xin said.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYzNkZDk3MWQ5NjRhZWJiYmFmY2U2NDYzMWMwN2Mw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Just...remembering things," Lorna replied, touching the scar on her left cheek. "How old are you, Xin?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZjFkM2NiYjAxNDRmMTE5YTJhMWIzODU0ODc4MzUx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I'll be 41 this October." He sat up straighter. "Why?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZGRhN2RmNTFjYTQzNzE5NGE0Y2UyZTdlZjA0ZGEz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"My 29th birthday is coming up soon, but sometimes I feel..." she paused. "Sometimes I feel ancient. Like I've lived several lives already."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjYxNjk5Mjk1YjRkOTE5YmM5Y2VlZDU0MGVhODI5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Well, life's a rough journey. It's okay to feel exhausted sometimes," Xin said.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOTE3OTM2MTY2NzQ4NDk4YTE3Y2Q5YTRlZDk5YjA4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Is my face okay, Xin? Does it look...you know," Lorna looked down and touched her cheek. Her fingers felt the rough texture of a thin scar from the knife wound, memories of torture from Iron Roach and Kaori still fresh.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZjc5Y2Y2NDM5NzRlNjA4MDFkMjJhOWNkYjg1YjEy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Well, you're still the most beautiful woman I've ever known," Xin said casually, but sounding concerned.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZjkzY2E4NTkxYzQ0ZWI5ZTMwNGUwNGM0ODQ0OWEy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna felt exposed but not uncomfortable. She lifted her head, her hand still covering the scar. "It's alright, Xin. Tell me the truth."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlN2FjYWY0MjEwYjQ1MTI4NGI4ZmFlZGRiOGU1MGVl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Well, it…it's a thermal blade cut, right? The doctor said it'll take about a week to heal. Said you should take three Medi-Vap doses each day," Xin pressed his lips together.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZTc5ODM3NDE2OTQ3ODZhNWZlZTNlZTEzZTBkMDBk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Typical combat injury, then," Lorna relaxed and moved her hand.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNGY1NDA2YTBkZDRmZTg5ZTNhMmUxMjE4M2JlM2I4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Still…" Xin's voice grew angry as he looked at her scar. "If I ever come across whoever did this to you, I'll make them pay."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NjljMjJlNTlhOTQ2MDQ5MTA1Y2NjYWQzYzRjYjJl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna half-smiled and looked down, feeling her cheek strain. But Xin's anger made her feel better somehow.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmM2Y5OGY2NGJlNTRhNmU5NWQ2NDMxMzM0NDE1MzNi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The quiet was broken by loud chimes from Lorna's bedside table. Xin pressed the blue panel.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YTQ3NDA5NmMzMjQwZWQ5YWJlZDc1MTc3YTg4ZDJi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A hologram appeared — Doctor Nikki Chakraborty, with sharp eyes behind sleek glasses. Her dark hair was neatly braided over her shoulder, matching her older face and blue-white medical robes.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMGMwY2ZlOTE0MTRhZDBiMTJmZmM2Zjg1NDg5ZDM2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Lorna. How are you feeling? Need more time?" Nikki asked professionally but with some sympathy.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMmNmODc1ODY3NDQ0N2ViMTFiZDM1NzkyMzMxODYw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna shifted, looking slightly defiant. "I'm okay. It was just another mission," she replied.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1N2I3YzJkZjI0MzQ4OWM5MjU3ZDI5ZGZkOGFhYzkx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Good. Mr. Wu, if you could give us a moment?" Nikki looked at Xin.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMmUxMjcwZDE1MTRjZWQ4YTM1Y2YyYzk0N2Y2YmJj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin hesitated, fidgeting with his hands.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OGVhMmNiYTZiZDQzN2VhMTAzMzdkZjg2ODRhYjdl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"It's alright, Doc," Lorna traced her fingers on the bed sheet. "Xin can stay."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MDM3MjU1NjMwMzQ5ZDNhMjQ0MThiMTFkMWVmMzVj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Nikki's eyes narrowed slightly. She paused before speaking. "Very well. Be advised, Mr. Wu, this conversation remains confidential. I trust you know what that means?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDU5MGE0NzZhMjQxZGFiOGQxY2Y1NDIwNjIwY2M1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I do, Doctor. Thank you," Xin sat back down as Nikki's hologram disappeared.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNzc3MWQwYTY4YjRmODRhZmE2ZWUzZGQ3ZWQ1MjM4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The door opened with a hiss. Nikki walked in and stood on the other side of Lorna's bed. The IV tubes disconnected from Lorna's arm with a click.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NTUxN2I5ZGE4YTRkZjI4M2Q5YzFmNDc1ODNhMzZh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Alright, let's cut to the chase," Nikki said evenly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MDJhMmNjMGZiZTQwZTJhNGQ4YjY3ZDQyZTQ3MTZi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Okay." Lorna held the edge of her bed. Her blue eyes locked onto Nikki's, looking for hope.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MjAzMTdjMDZkNDRkODU4NGVjMTMyZTQ3MmYyZmMz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Combat-induced injuries aside," Nikki spoke clinically but not unkindly, "you've been infected with the Nucleus Virus. The Fenris variant, stage one."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjNkMGRmMzcyOTRjZDBiMzVlMjdlN2RmNjMyOTBl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna gripped the bedsheet tighter. "Am I turning? Into a Radi-Mon?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZmRhOGEzOTExMTQ0ZmJhYWY5YzI5NTRhOTYyNzU4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"No. We caught it within the 72-hour window. You'll remain human." Nikki glanced briefly at Xin before looking back at Lorna. "However, the Virus is permanent. Transmissible through any exchange of bodily fluids or Aether."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOWQ5MzZlOTE3MTRmNDc4ODFkYjA3NzU2N2U0NDZj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna closed her eyes, smiling bitterly. "So that's it then. No more...connections. Not without risking someone else's life."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NmRiNjRlOTlmNzQwZjY5MDQxMTZmOTFlZWIyYzM1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"There are precautions," Nikki said, "but given your work and the Virus's ability to transfer through Aether exchange, complete abstinence would be safest. Your aging process will halt, which some consider a benefit, but you might need medication for the psychological effects later."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMmE2NzAzYjllMjQ5Yzk4YzU2ZWM0ZTAyYjE2OTJj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Psychological effects?" Xin asked, shifting in his seat.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZTJiMTllNWRkMTRiOTM5NjAxMmQ2MTRiMjk4YTY4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Disrupted sleep patterns. Night terrors. Possible personality changes if left untreated." Nikki disconnected the IV stand. "The medical fees have been deducted from your salary."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMTZiOGEyODkwOTRhMzE4MzI5NjFlOGE2MmVhMjg3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"What?" Lorna's eyes opened wide. "I caught this virus for fighting—"</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYWJiYTNhZTA1YTRlYTdiZjRlN2I0MWY4M2FmY2Zl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"An engagement that Diego firmly advised against," Nikki interrupted, though not harshly. "I'll inform Director Otis of your recovery. Two days until you're cleared for duty."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NWIwNjA1NjQzODQ5MmVhZGY2MTZkMzBiNjcxZTI0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">After Nikki left, silence filled the room. Lorna stared at her hands, wondering how much more she'd have to give up for this job.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNmU4NWI2MWVjNzRjMDhhYjMxYjgxZmY3MmE1NDhh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Hey, it's not — insurmountable," Xin said quietly. "There are ways."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3M2YxZDdhNDUxZTQxZDRiNWRiNjA1NDAyZjNjMTU0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"To what?" Lorna laughed without humor. "To pretend everything's normal? That I'm not poison to anyone I touch?" She looked into his concerned eyes. "This job...physical intimacy was my escape. The one place I could just be...human. And now even that's gone."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MjU3NjBjNmE0YzRkMGJiYjA4YWVkMDU2YTEyODM1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin spoke carefully. "I understand. With the androids, it was similar. A space where control didn't matter. Where consequences didn't exist."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMTAxNGYzZWYzNjQ3MmU5ZTgxMjMzMzUwNmMwNWFl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna stared at him. "Androids? You're comparing my situation to...using sex bots?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ODc1NjM4MmEyMjQxN2Y4MjhkNGU4MGRmOWZjMjYx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"That's not what I—" Xin started, then stopped, pushing his glasses up. "There was someone I had. An android named Ume."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhODZhZjM2ZWM5NjQzZDQ4NmRjYTdkZDg3YTgxNmFl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Had?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOTA5OTY5NTI0NTRjNDliNTYxNmRhMjgyZDRkZDRj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"She's…with the Directorate now." His face darkened. "But before her, I tried the "pay to win" route. Leased Lily contracts. Three of them, actually."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYTNkOGU3MjU1YzQ0NTRhNDUxYjdhOTA4NmM2MDI4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Three." Lorna repeated, understanding dawning.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MTFmMTZkZWRiYzQ1MDdiMThhNWIzZjM2YWViMjdj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Surprising, I imagine," Xin said, his posture shifting slightly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MjRiMTQ0YWYwYTRjNjE4OGVhODZjZTQwMmQ1YzQ4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"No. I know what that's like." Lorna sighed. "What happened?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzhlOWVlMmRmYjQwZDE4N2IwZWVlNGU1YjI2ZGRk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I kept breaking the cardinal rule," Xin smiled self-mockingly. "Got emotionally attached. Made things awkward. The first one, Annette, requested early termination after I wrote her a love letter. Similar cases for Ying and Megumi…" He shook his head. "Anyway, that's why I switched to androids. At least with them, the boundaries are clear. Or they were."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMmVlNmZmYTllNDRkMDQ4Y2RiYzI0YWJkOTczNDg2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Until this Ume," Lorna finished. She looked at him with new interest, seeing beyond the careful exterior of the Imperial programmer.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZjMxYmZhNGI4MzQ2NjM5NWYxNTlmOWZlNzFlY2Jm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yeah." Xin met her gaze. "So I'd like to think I understand needing an escape, needing to feel human. Not exactly the same way, but...you know?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNDgxYjYzMzY2ZDQ3NzY4M2I5YzhhZjk0ZWVkNzM2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The confession hung between them, more intimate than expected.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZDc5NGVlMTAxNDQ0NjM5ZDc0ODU3YjIxYmJhZmVl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The door opened with a hiss.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyODA0ZWE3OWE5NTQ5ZjBhMWM1Y2RhODM0NjQ1YjFl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Diego walked in, interrupting them, his confident stride a welcome break in the tension.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZjU3NGYyNWQ5NjRiOTU4Y2JkMzY2NWNkNDdmNjc0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"¡Oye! Look who's finally awake," Diego grinned as he approached Lorna's bed. He carried a small tablet that flickered with data. "Ready to raise hell again, hermana?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NmU1NDRjODllYzQ4N2Y5NDVkZDBmMWM0YWVmYzVi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Almost," Lorna replied with a faint smile. "Just need to get out of this damn bed."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyY2RkYTMwZjE0MzQzYWRiMzBjZjZmNjUyYjUyYjBl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Diego nodded, then turned to Xin. "Got some news for you, amigo. We found that green beauty of yours." He tapped his tablet, showing a 3D image of Xin's car — or what was left of it. The vehicle was a mangled mess of twisted metal and broken glass, barely recognizable from the sleek car that had crashed through Terminal 5 to rescue Lorna.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNGMyMTAyNzEwNTQyODJiNTEyNzIzMTU4YjdlODUy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin's eyes widened behind his glasses, sounding relieved and surprised. "You found it. How?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MTRiZTkzNDY5YTQ5NWQ4NGU2YjYwNTE2YTk1OTY1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I have connections in places where official Alliance channels don't reach." Diego winked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZjAxZTgzMWMwZTQzN2M5ZTk2NjI4NTFkZTVmZGE1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"What's left of it, anyway," Lorna said dryly, looking at the hologram.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZmZmMzdjOTRhZjQzYmZiOWM0ZmUxMmZjNjYwYTgz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Hey, ramming it through a starport wall then into a cybernetic Golden Serpent wasn't in the user manual," Diego laughed. "But it's salvageable. Fusion core is intact. Got it moved to a secure garage in Stardust Command."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDQ1ODE4Y2VmMzRkMDhhZWMwNTkxMzc0ZGI5MDM5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin leaned forward to examine the damage. "And the dashboard is alright? The custom modifications I made?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNWM0YTkxZDIxMjQwNTE5N2Y0YzYxYzVhYTQ0NDQ3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Memory banks are recoverable. The rest..." Diego made a so-so gesture. "It'll take time, ese. Couple months, maybe more. Parts for these models aren't easy to find. And restoration won't be cheap."</span></p><span class="cmM3ZGE1NWUwMzM3ZDQ3NzliNDYzN2I2NmY3MDgwODY2"><br/>Stolen from Royal Road, this story should be reported if encountered on Amazon.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM5M2Q3ZTAzZGFmYTQ0YzliMzJiYTRiMzczMmI1MmQ5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"SIMU has funds for this kind of thing, right?" Lorna said suddenly, surprising both men. She shrugged, wincing slightly. "Why not talk to Director Otis?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZTMzYzgzMDk3YzQwNDFiM2RiNTc1M2I1YmYxNTIy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Diego's eyebrows rose, a knowing smile on his lips as he looked between them. "Well, mira esto. You're onto something."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NmJkZjc1YjhiMTQxN2ZhNzA1NTExZGQwZDcyMmRh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Xin's colleagues," Lorna said flatly, though she blushed slightly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOWQ2ZWVjN2Y0YjQxZWViM2Y3MmE0MGQyNzY1OGRm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Of course. I'll talk to the Director." Diego tucked the tablet under his arm and headed for the door. "Oh, and — the Atomic Summit's pretty heated today. Alliance and Imperium delegates nearly came to blows. Might want to check the news?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMmJmYTdlZjAxZTQ1MTVhY2MwN2E4OThmOTgzN2My"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">With that hint, Diego left, leaving Lorna and Xin alone again.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzY3ZTRmOWVhOTQ3NjliMjRiNTNjMzY3MmUwOTIz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Might as well see what the fuss is about," Lorna sighed, looking at the television on the wall. "Remote?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ODY2MTM3ZTFjMjRjYzg4MjAwYjlmMzYxNGJmNDBh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin found the remote on the side table and handed it to her, their fingers touching briefly. The contact sent an unexpected jolt through Lorna, making her pause before taking it with a mumbled thanks. She pressed the power button, and the screen came on.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZTQyNGVkNTgzYTRkYjA5YzU1OGVkNmE4YTY3NDcy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Atomic News Network logo appeared before showing a split screen. Lorna's eyebrows rose as she saw Diego on one side, looking formal in a crisp navy suit with the Alliance insignia on his lapel. On the other side was a Djinno woman with a heart-shaped face, full lips, and dark brown eyes. She had a bindi on her forehead, her black hair decorated with gold ornaments, and wore the red and gold robes of an Imperium official.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1M2ZhOTYxZjZkZDRlZWNhYjA4ZGIzOWRhZTI0NTU4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"—is nothing short of an invasion of sovereign territory," the woman was saying, her voice melodic yet authoritative like most high-ranking Imperium diplomats. "The Terra Alliance's unauthorized incursion into Taipei shows a flagrant disregard for international law."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZmY0Yjg1YzMzZjQ2ZTk5NjgzOTg3NTcwZDhlNDE2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Secretary Shazmeen," Diego countered, leaning forward with unusual intensity, "the Imperium's failure to uphold its obligations under the Svalbard Concordat forced our hand. Your government was entrusted with containing Primarch Skarn. Instead, evidence suggests you've been weaponizing this dangerous Radi-Mon for military applications."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Yjc4NWIzZDJmZTQ2M2M5NTg2MzQwODI2NmUzYzlj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"No wonder!" Xin exclaimed, chuckling.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MzFhOTczMjlmNzRiZWY5MjJhZThiY2I2NDU4ZmEw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Diego doubles as media spokesperson when asked to, yeah," Lorna muttered with a grin, shifting higher against the pillows. "I think that's his favorite part of the job. See how his Novian accent is gone? If the screen was off, I'd have thought it was a local Valoran speaking."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOWY1MGM3MTRmZjRjMjE5OGM4ZGEzNGNiMDczNzhj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Shazmeen looked indignant, though Lorna could tell it was fake. "These accusations are baseless propaganda designed to justify illegal Alliance operations on Imperium soil. We categorically reject—"</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OTU0NDkyN2RkMjRiNjg5MWJmNjk3ZjEzOWZiNmY5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Is that why multiple witnesses reported seeing Skarn fitted with Imperium cybernetic enhancements?" Diego interrupted, his casual manner replaced by diplomatic firmness. "Technology that bears the unmistakable signature of your military research division?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Nzc4NjZjZTFmZjRjZDZhNjIzYTZmMzJlZmM4ZTRj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Shazmeen's eyes narrowed. "Your 'witnesses' are nothing more than paid provocateurs spreading misinformation. The Imperium demands immediate sanctions against the Alliance for this unprovoked aggression!"</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NzQxOGUxNzIwNDRmNDdiYTBmZjk1MmYyZDJjNzc4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"So that's what Diego meant about the Summit heating up," Xin said, watching excitedly. "He's calling them out on what they did to Skarn, what they did to us."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NGExZGYyYWYzMTRkYTA4OTRlYmJhYTBjZTEwZWIw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"They're both doing their jobs." Lorna watched the screen, noting the confidence in Diego's posture and the calculated anger in Shazmeen's gestures. It was all theater, she knew—a political performance with real consequences. "Just doing their jobs," she repeated.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNTdmMDkwNTRhZTRmMWE5MGNhMDNlYmU1NTAyZWQx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You don't sound excited," Xin turned to Lorna with intensity. "The Imperium would use the Moondust Crystal to control everyone if they could. We're on the right side of this."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwODhkODkxM2I3ZTQ3NDZhZjNiNmU5YWQ0ZTIyOWUz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna studied him, noting the flush on his cheeks and the earnest set of his jaw.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZWM0N2EzMzZiZjRjZjk5ZjRhZDY0ZTFkYjM4Yzll"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I wish I could be excited like you about these things. You feel...younger, almost naive. I envy that." She shifted against her pillows, touching the scar on her cheek.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZmJjZWMwNDUxMjRiNjE4ZGIwNTUzZmNmNTMyOGUy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Hey, I'm a lucky Imperial, getting to live outside the iron curtain, right?" Xin scratched his head with a self-deprecating smile. "Luck. A sign that the gods have deemed our paths righteous and given us aid."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MGQwZjM4NmVmOTQ2YTM5ZmQzYWM1NTA1ODljMTI2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I don't know if gods exist at all." She sighed, looking away, memories of her last days in Scandinavia flashing in her mind. "If they do, it's like they enjoy watching us suffer."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNmM1MWQyYTZlNjQ1ZTQ5ZjczNDI3N2U4ZDE4ZmQ4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Gods or not, the Alliance and the Valorans' positive attitude is much more inspiring than…I don't know…the whole 'Obey your superiors and elders' that we'd teach back home." Xin held up a hand. "But I get it. It's okay to feel down on some days."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNDMwYWRiN2M3MDQzN2E5ZjI4YWY0NjM1NGU1MmUx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna felt her heart ache at his comment. If only he knew she was no Valoran. If only she could tell him. But would he even understand? The weight of her heritage?</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDhlMzVhNjBkYzQ4Y2Q5NGFmMTRjYzY1YzRhZWRl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I chose the Alliance because it made the most sense at the time," she said finally, matter-of-factly. "Not because I believe they're the good guys."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NGYyNmRlNjRiZDRiNzJhZTcwYzM4YzZlNDU4ZjUx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin's expression faltered slightly. "Chose? They? I thought you were born here?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMTc2NTlmYTNmODRmMTY5N2QyZjAwOWNmZGU1NTc4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Avoiding the questions, Lorna pointed at the screen, where Diego and Secretary Varma were exchanging veiled accusations. "You think the Alliance officials wouldn't use the Crystal if they got their hands on it? Every faction wants power."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOWUzNmVkOWVlZjQyYWU5ZWRmZDgzYWExMmE1MjY4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin was quiet for a moment. Then he moved from his chair to sit carefully on the edge of her bed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNGQ1OGRhOGE0ZTQ0MjJhMzFiMTczOWQ4MGQ4NzY4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Maybe," he admitted quietly. "But isn't it worth fighting for the lesser evil? For a chance to make things better, even if it's not perfect?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYzc2NmRiNzRkZTRhMWI4MDI2ZWUwZmE0NWM5ZmQy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna turned to face him, suddenly aware of how close they were. His earnest expression and furrowed brow made her want to both pull him closer and push him away. Her fingers twisted in the hospital sheets.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMmNkZjQ1ZWFhZjRiY2ZiYjgxNzZlYjJjNTQ5ZDVl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Maybe," she echoed, her blue eyes dropping briefly to his lips before darting away. "Or maybe I'm just tired of fighting other people's wars."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkODRlNjk0MGFlOTQ2OTA4YjFjZDAyZDY2MThkNjdl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin leaned back slightly, giving her space, but kept his eyes on hers. "What would you fight for, if you could choose?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOGEyMjZkNDI1NTQ3MzlhMGQ1NDgwMjVlZWUyMGVl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The question hung between them. Lorna opened her mouth to respond. "There's someone I've been wanting to find. My — " Her voice caught on the word she hadn't spoken in years.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ODFkMWFiOGZjYzRkODNhY2VkOGMwZmMzYTNmYjEy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The door opened with a hiss, interrupting her. Thomas and Emmanuel stood in the doorway, each carrying brown paper bags that smelled of greasy, delicious fast food. Thomas's cybernetic arms whirred as they reflected the light, his silver eyes taking in the scene knowingly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MDgyYWQ5ZmZiNjRlMTNiYzQ2MjJkMzYxOTc4Yjlh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Hope we're not interrupting anything?" Thomas asked, his metallic hand against the doorframe.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMWM3OTk3YTlhMjRlM2RiY2ZiOWY5NjUyZjMxN2Fi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Because we can come back later if you two need a moment," Emmanuel added with a grin, holding up his paper bag and shaking it. "Or we could share these burgers and shakes from Wendell's. Your call."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MDNmNzhhNzFlYTRhNThiZGMyMDgzZjQ3YmE4YmJl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Well, don't just stand there teasing us with those bags," Lorna called out with a smile.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OGExZGQwZDljMjQyZDA5OGQ0NWI5YzY2NDFjZjg3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Thomas and Emmanuel exchanged looks before entering and sharing the food.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NTQ2MzAzM2RhZTRlNzNhNDBiMGNjYzYzOTk2NDVl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The TV still showed the Atomic Accord Summit. A dignified Maridian man stood at the podium, his bald head shining under the lights. The caption read 'Chairman Kofi Mensah, Emerald Directorate.'</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMTFmZjVmZmY5NjQxM2ViMjU3YjcxMzI2ZjMxMDU0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Regarding the allegations concerning android unit U6-M9," a reporter asked, "how does the Directorate respond to claims of unauthorized acquisition?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNWEyMTI3OThlYTQxZGE5MDkwZmQ1ZWE2NjgxYWE3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Chairman Mensah answered calmly, his hands on the podium. "I'm not certain that designation refers to any android I personally know, but the Directorate maintains diplomatic channels with all nations across the Inner Sol."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYjMwZjI5YjFhODQzYTk4NDY2ZjIzZDBiMTMzNzlj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"And the reported confrontation in NIPU territory?" Another reporter pressed.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYWRiZjdmZmRiZTQ1ZWNiNWYwY2RmNzJjNTU3YTY3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The current climate of interplanetary relations is complex." Mensah's slight smile never wavered. "Just last week, we discussed territorial disputes with the Alliance on Jupiter's moons. The week before, concerns about the Imperium's dominance on Mars. Perhaps we should focus on these broader matters?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOGU5NzMwZTI4ODQ1MjQ4MzkxZTI2MGY5ODZjYTU5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna noticed Xin's fingers tighten on his chair's armrest, though his face remained neutral.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNDg4NDgzMzUyODRlYjM4Zjk1NjVmMDNhNzZkMjNm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Directorate sure knows how to play both sides," Thomas said between bites of his burger, pointing at the screen with his metal hand, "ever think about going back, Manny?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMTlhMmFhNjc4YTRmYjNiMDJmMDczOTE3OTFkM2Zi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Emmanuel snorted, sitting down. "Nah, I'm good here." He passed Lorna a vanilla shake. "Besides, Celine's probably taken my old spot by now."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NTcyNDAyNGVhMzQ1NmE5OTJjN2FmNDg4NzMyYWQy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Could've been running your own warband by now," Thomas teased.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNWViZmU5ZjI3NTQ0MGJhZTZkNjU5ODRiOTk5Yjlm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yeah. Could've been dead in a ditch too," Emmanuel replied. "You know how it gets out there. Especially with these Radi-Mon sightings increasing beyond the Belts."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNTA4NDRiOGZmYTRmNGJiMmIxMzliNzY5M2MzMjgx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna rubbed her temple, trying to stop the growing pressure in her head. Thomas noticed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MDcyMDA1ODY4MzRmYzZiYzRlMTA4NmM2YWRiMTRl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"We should probably head out," he said, standing. "Got that training session at noon, Xin. Don't forget – Director's orders."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2N2QwYWNlNTM2NjRmYjNhOTA5YzRjY2Y5NjNlOWRl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin nodded, checking his watch. "The basics of marksmanship, correct?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NGI1NDYwOTY0YTQzOWZiYjA3MTdiMjFiNjhmNTEw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Among other things." Thomas gathered the empty wrappers.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5M2MwNzg0YTNlZjQxYTE4ODVlODRlOGYwYjVjOGRh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Emmanuel stood, stretching and turning to Lorna with a grin. "Try not to miss us too much, okay?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYTY2ZWU3Yzg5MTQ2ZTI4YjlmNTNiMzVmNTQyYzhm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Just go," Lorna waved them off. "And thanks for the food."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZTEyZjM0Y2U3MzRlODI4NTNhZTM2NGIzZmU4MWVl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">After they left, Lorna stared at her half-eaten burger, her stomach growling. "This isn't going to cut it, though," she muttered, pushing the wrapper away. "I feel like I could eat three more of these. At least."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMGJlNmNmMDdkOTQ4ZWY4N2Q1NGFkZGZlOWM1NzY3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"How about some additions, then?" Xin replied with confidence. He got up and walked to a nearby table to get some items.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MDU3Y2MxMzM1NjRhYWQ5ZTViYmU3YjFhNzFmNjdm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">He returned and placed several plates of food on her bedside table. Three plates were set before her: steamed rice, slices of pork in soy sauce, and stir-fried cabbage. Next to them were two small porcelain bowls.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYjVhMzZkYWIyODQxMmJhNWU3ZGE5Mzk1Y2JmY2Q5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Did you make this?" she whispered, looking confused.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNzk5ZDVjZjdmZTQzMGJhYzY0MGEyNWE4ZjU2ZGM0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yeah, we went shopping last night. I decided to buy a rice cooker near Davis Street Station and whip something up." he replied with a small smile as he passed her a bowl of rice with chopsticks. "Wanted to try the Maglev Train, too, but 'maybe next time' was all Thomas said."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNjBiZDQyY2JjYjQ5NmU4OTdiZjBlMDM4MzQyM2Zi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yeah, that sounds like Tom." Lorna looked between the plates and Xin's face. She hesitated before admitting, "I don't know how to use chopsticks, though."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMmZlYTA4NzJiMjQ3ZTA4OWJiMWExNzE2NmZhYTFm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Oops! Give me a minute," he set the chopsticks down and opened a drawer in the bedside table to reveal some utensils. "Here you go," he said, handing her a spoon.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMjdjODJjNDYxNTQxYmViYWY5ZTk3OTVmYjcxZGYw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Thanks," she said, taking it with a nod.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZjlmNDVhOWI2ODQ5ZDg5ODQzNmUzMDcxZjk3YmUw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin used another spoon to put some braised pork over her rice. The dark, glossy meat glistened with sauce, smelling of soy, star anise, and something Lorna couldn't identify.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDgyNmI5ZGUzZDQ1ZGFiZmNmNmY1ZmM3MmMzMGY2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She looked at her half-eaten burger still in wax paper, then at the steaming bowl Xin had given her. The smell was foreign - sweet yet savory, nothing like the salty Nordic food she grew up with.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNGE1NTZkZmQwZTQ2OTFhNWU3Yzc0MmQ4MGQ4NTNk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"What exactly is this?" she asked, poking a piece of pork with her spoon. The meat fell apart, showing tender layers stained by the sauce.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNTkzMjJlMGRhYTQ0MzVhYjM4OGRkNDk1MzFiNTMw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Lu rou fan," Xin answered, then corrected himself. "Sorry - braised pork rice. It's a comfort food from my hometown. My father used to make it." His fingers fidgeted with his chopsticks. "I thought...maybe you'd like to try something different."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZDE2YmI3M2QyYjQ3MmRhNDkxYzIxZWY5NTVhYTg3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna hesitated. The smell was strong - almost overwhelming after days of barely eating. Part of her wanted to stick with her familiar burger.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NmIyYzU2YzUxYzRhMjM4Mzc2ZDI0NTk4Yjk1YjZi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The, uh, meat is cooked in soy sauce with garlic and..." Xin continued, speaking faster with nervousness. "There's a bit of five-spice powder too, which might seem strange at first, but— "</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZjAzMTY2ODk1MzRhODI4NGFiNTVkZmE4Nzk2YThk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"It's fine," Lorna interrupted, her tone softer than intended. She set aside the burger wrapper and took a small spoonful of rice and pork.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMjU4MjdkOTg0ZDQyNTVhZTc0NjY4MmMzZDU1NzRj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The first taste was sweeter than expected, with flavors of broth and hints of cinnamon and clove that strangely reminded her of Christmas in Bjørgvin. She chewed slowly, getting used to the unfamiliar taste.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZmZiODIyMjRjZDRhYTY4OGVkYzcxMDY0ZmI2ODA0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin watched her anxiously, forgetting his own meal.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOWE4ZjZjNWE1YzQxZGI4YTM5ZjY1YTUyZmM4ZmI3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">After swallowing, Lorna took another, bigger bite. "It's different," she admitted. Then, with a surprising grin: "I like it."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MGE2MzVlZjE1ZDQxZDA4YmRlODJjMzkxZDE3Njc4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I'm glad." Xin's shoulders relaxed as he smiled. He picked up his own bowl and started eating with his chopsticks.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OWMwYWZjNzNjZDQ0ODNhOTAxNTQ3ZWFjMzg3NGNk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The braised pork rice was comforting with each bite. The food's smell mixed with the hospital scents, somehow making the room feel almost homey.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxY2U3NWU1YzEzMjRlNTg4OWQ5NzI3YzFiNDczNzdi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">They ate quietly for a few minutes.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZjBjYWVkY2RjZTRiNWRhNWM0NjJkY2VhZjdiYjFl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna caught Xin looking at her, his eyes soft with empathy, and she felt something inside her relax. Vulnerability was dangerous, but with Xin, it seemed less so.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiY2YzOTM0MzY3ZDRiODdhNjlmNGZjMWM5MTVjMTky"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"So..." Lorna traced the rim of her bowl with her spoon. "This Ume was somebody special to you?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMyODhhN2YxM2Q3MzQ2MGU4NGM4NWJlYTdmZTBjMWE1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin's chopsticks stopped halfway to his mouth. He set them down carefully, adjusting them until they were perfectly parallel. "ZenFusion gave her to me as a 'reward.' Two years of performance metrics." His fingers tapped once on the table before stopping. "But she wasn't just that. She shouldn't be."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NTg0YjNhYjcxYTQ3ZDI5NWM3NzEzM2VkYTgzNDMz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">He stopped talking, his gaze distant. Lorna recognized that look - the same one she'd seen in her mirror after Oslo, when everything familiar had become strange.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMTZiMTAzNDBkYjQ1YzY4OWE0ZjY5YjU1MjdhNWE2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You tried to make it real," she said softly.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNDlhYTgyNGQ4YjQzMTI5ZjVjNzYyODc2NmY3YzU4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I gave her free will. As much as I could, anyway," His voice mixed pride and pain. "Months spent learning how android programs work. Broke through her programming, so she can make her own choices." A small smile crossed his lips. "I suppose she did."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZWJlNDgyYTJhMzQ4M2U5Mjg0NDRiMDkxNjlhOTA5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"She chose to leave you." Lorna noticed the slight shake in his hand as he reached for his chopsticks again.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MDZjOTBmMThmZTRkYzQ5NTE1OTI5NGVhNjUxOTJk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Thomas was with me when we saw her with the Directorate. A Scarab pilot named Jabari." he continued, focusing on picking up a piece of pork. "Living the life she wanted. That's what matters, right?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNWNmZjVmYTM1NDRhZTM4Y2FkOGQ0N2MxYjliM2Y0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"And what about what you wanted?" Lorna asked before she could stop herself.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZWEwZWEzMTE0MDQ0OGE4ZThiYWJhMTYzNjZkYmVk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin looked at her, surprised. Then he looked away, adjusting his glasses with slightly unsteady fingers.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZWYwYTY2MDY4ZTRiMTJhMjI2ZDc4ODk3YzkwNDBm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I wanted..." he began, then shook his head. "I wanted to prove that real connection was possible. Even for someone like me."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NjIyMjBkZmExZDRlY2Q5NzBiOGIxYzkxNzFiYzFl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The confession hung between them. Lorna found herself studying how sunlight played on his olive skin, the tension in his shoulders as he waited for her response. She understood now why he'd stayed by her bedside these four days.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ODE0ZjBkYzkzNjRjMmViMTk4ODgzMmViMDQ4Y2Ez"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Would you mind telling me about what happened?" Xin asked quietly, almost hesitantly. "At the Starport?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMjFlMDg2ZjkwOTQyNDk4N2YzYjgyMTllYTZiNDc4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna's spoon stopped against her bowl. Through the window, a military shuttle crossed the sky, briefly darkening the room. Her fingers went to her collarbone, tracing an invisible line. She glanced at another bedside table, relieved to see the Pendant of Mánagrát there, its blue jewel glowing faintly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMmNmOGFjODhlMzQxZTE5YjczZmU2MjE4ZTgzOWFk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Skarn," she began, then stopped. The name felt like ash in her mouth. She put down her spoon with a sharp click against the porcelain.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOWJhMzM0YTVkZTQ1MGVhZmRlNDFkM2NmMmEzODcw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin waited, forgetting his own meal. He sat still - patient, focused.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YjM3ZmI4OWI4MzQ5ZTZiZmIxMGQ0MmU2MTRlOGNl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I thought I could take him." A bitter smile touched her lips. "But it was my Psytum Sword against...whatever the Imperium put inside him. Nothing I did could scratch his hide." Her hand moved from her collarbone to her throat unconsciously. "He made me swallow..."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDNhOGNjNzkxOTQ2N2I4YWJkNzkwZmM2YjRlOWZi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The words wouldn't come. They didn't need to. She saw understanding darken Xin's eyes, his fingers curling into a tight fist against his leg.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTNiMDQ2NWRlMjRlOWVhODc0YTc2NGJiZWFiNWEw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"That's how I got infected," she finished, her voice steady despite her trembling hand. "He made sure of it."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZjRiNTU2MGY0MzRiYzY4OWIyNjg0NjdjOWU0NTYx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin carefully set his chopsticks across his bowl. "You survived. You got back up. That's what matters."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNGMyZTliNDAxZDQxM2Y5NWY2MDVlMjk3MDkzYjM0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Is it?" The question came out sharper than intended. "Look at me now. I can't even..." She gestured at the space between them.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTI2YTM2Y2Y3ODQ2NzhiNDM3MTU1MzgyYzcyYTY4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I see you," Xin said simply. No pity in his eyes, no retreat. Just recognition. "Someone who walked through hell and kept her soul."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNWE0NDMyMTUwNDQ3Y2VhZmYyMzg3NmUxZWM1ZjFl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Something in his presence made her chest tight. It was different from Emmanuel's protective hovering or Thomas's careful distance. Xin saw her scars and didn't flinch, didn't try to fix or fade them. Just acknowledged them and waited, letting her choose how much else to reveal.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyN2E5YjYyNjZhZDQ2MjZiMDEzMjVhZjljMDE1YTJj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna picked up her spoon again, focusing on the simple pleasure of warm food. Each bite helped ground her in the present, away from darker memories.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MmI4NjFmZTY1YzQyOGE5MDlkNDI3YTQ2NzIzMTRm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Actually," she said suddenly, her voice surprisingly light, "I should be asking what you need." She gestured at his green Quantum Watch. "The SIMU — we're like a dysfunctional family, and you're stuck with us now."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNWVlOTM2YjMzMzRjMjU4ZTg5ZTg5MTdlYjU4MjM5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin blinked at the change in tone, chuckled, then matched it with visible relief. "Well, Thomas is teaching me the basics. Though watching recorded sessions on my watch isn't quite the same as actual practice." He lifted his arm, the watch's green light reflecting around them. "Especially with a Gauss Rifle."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMDY0ZjY1MTc1ZDQwM2ViZWM5MmU0MTJhNWUyMGRm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Those are basically artillery pieces, perfect for tough big boys like him," Lorna snorted, some of her usual spark returning. "I'd start with something that won't dislocate your shoulder." She paused, looking at his slender frame.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMzViOTRiNTM0NzRkZDRiYzcyNzZhMmRkODUyMzMz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yeah?" Xin joked. "I was wondering when the recoil would send my arms flying."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNThlNDk3YTVlODQ5YmNhZDMwMGExZTMwYTMwMTk0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"A 10mm would suit you better. Good stopping power if you know how. Besides, you already have one," she said.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MzcyNDI4ZWRiZTRmM2RhNTE1M2FjNDAzMDY0ODk1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You think so?" his eyes lit up. His fingers tapped against his green watch.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZTdiODZkZmQ5ODRjOGJhZDdhZDcyMmJhOGFiNzc0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Among other things." Lorna tilted her head, remembering his driving during their escape. "Your driving isn't bad either. Ever tried a Space Rover?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZDRlOGRlYmIzODRjZWFiMTY2NTIyNTgwOTk1MDg2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I heard ZenFusion used to make those Rovers. Before the Imperium came and made the company theirs." He adjusted his glasses. "Though after what happened to my car, maybe I should stick to hacking?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMTA0N2Y0NDk2NjRlODQ5ZmMzNDhhODZmYTQ3M2Y5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"No," Lorna said firmly, surprising them both with her forceful tone. "You have good instincts. Just need to refine them." She caught his gaze, held it. "I could teach you, if you want."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNjk5YzZkMGQ4NDQwMTVhNjU5YjNiMGY4MzlmYjky"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Something changed in Xin's expression, a mix of gratitude and determination. His shoulders straightened slightly. "I'd like that. What can I offer in return?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMDViMWFmY2Y2NzQ3ZTk4NDMzMmZlMGFlMjYzYjBh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You already have," Lorna said softly, gesturing at the meal he'd prepared. Then she added with a small smirk, "Besides, we need someone who'd care to study the Moondust Crystal when we find it."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOGVkZjNlYTZjZDRkYjE5MWZkNmYzYzNjYTY4Nzhk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Assuming it doesn't fry my Quantum Watch first," Xin replied, tapping the device with a wry smile. "Whoever took over that server added new encryption that nearly crashed my QPUs, you know?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Mjc3YmY4NzY2MTQxNTdhYmFjYjg2MWM4NzEyNzQw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Is that what happened back in the Amber Moon Spire?" Lorna raised an eyebrow and laughed. "No wonder that Bloodtrooper got you!"</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYmU4MWRlMjNiOTQxZjViZWFjNDM3Y2E5NzkyMmU0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Their laughter mixed in the morning air. Through the window, Evanston's skyline glittered in the sun, catching the blue jewel of her pendant and casting a faint glow across her hospital gown. The path ahead would be full of challenges. But this time, she wasn't alone with her secrets.</span></p>
