<p class="cnMwYmRkNDJkODIzODQ0ZTBhNDJiMDIyZjc3MmEzMjk5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><span style="font-size: 1.5em"><strong>T</strong></span>he morning sun streamed through the Engineering Library's windows, lighting up old wood panels from the Digital Era. Fusion generators hummed beneath clear floor panels, their blue glow mixing with sunlight. At a research station, Xin sat typing while Lorna watched from the side.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YTNiNWU2ZmUwMTRiMjNiZDgxZjU0MzAxOWIxMTEw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Any luck?" she asked, leaning forward. The Pendant of Mánagrát caught the light at her throat as her beige trench coat shifted. Håkon perched on a nearby shelf, his blue scales shimmering as he watched the library.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDRkZWI0MGE0MzRiODU5NTc5ZmNlZjYyN2I0M2Mw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yeah, the override code works." Xin said, adjusting his glasses. Kuma - Emmanuel's Kinetic SMG - rested against his back, its polymer surface softer than it appeared. "Now to find where in California they've hidden this next shard..."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NzQyNGI2NjgwODQwOTE4NThlYjNkMjQ2NTJjYTc1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Earlier, I found forty-three references to 'moondust' in my searches on another terminal," Lorna muttered as Xin scrolled through results. "and exactly zero mentions of where Watrous might have hidden anything."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZmU1NjVhNzkxOTQzY2RiYTkxMjg1MGMxZGIzNjkx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I'm not sure Watrous could hide a Moondust shard. He's looking for one, too, remember?" He turned to her, speaking softly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZjE0YmNmMWZjYzRjNjNhNzE2NGI4OWFkOTRkM2Zh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You're right." She ran a hand through her hair. "I feel dumb in front of computers."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NWFlYjcwMGNmZTQ1YWQ4OGU1M2JhZjMyM2RkYzBj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Hey, that's what I'm here for." He reached out to touch her hand gently. "You're great on the battlefield."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNjAwMjRlMDkzMjQzMmI5MGM4NjNhYzE2YjQyZWUx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Håkon trilled encouragingly at Lorna.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNmE3MzdlODM1MjQwZjA4MmEyYjJlMDUyYjZkMDkw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She smiled as Xin withdrew his hand, returning his attention to the terminal.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOTQwZTk5Yjk1MTQ0NTBiODkzZmM4NDhjMmI2OThl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A shimmer in the air preceded a holographic projection - Chief Executive Reeves appearing beside them in his golden business suit, one hand behind his back. He held a lit cigarette.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OGZiYWMwNGM0ODRhMDg4ZWNhNzFhNWFjNjk2YTI3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Having trouble with our databases, Agent Weiss?" The man asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNTA1NDgzMThmMDRkYWJiZGI4YzUyMWZlMGU3NGM1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna's shoulders tensed. "Mr. Reeves. I thought you'd be coordinating your Wardens outside."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YjZhNDExNDAxNDRjYjk5OGYxYTQ0ZmFlZjdhYWMz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"And miss the chance to assist our new allies?" He gestured at the terminal. "Stanford's quantum repositories can be...particular. They were designed to protect GSR state secrets, after all."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYWFiYzUzYzE5NzRjMzE4OThkYjY3MGE3OWQ3ODAw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Any tips?" Xin asked, pausing his typing.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNTk0N2VkOTgyMDQ5Zjc5MmVhY2FhMDA0OWVhOGM0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Try accessing the 'Visiting Scholars' partition. Password is 'Eureka-1849.'" Reeves said.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMDAyN2QwNjQ0MTQwMDU5ZjkxOGMwOWFiNzY0MDVh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"On it —" Xin's fingers flew across the interface. A new directory tree appeared on the display. "That worked. Thank you."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOGFjMGRiMzU4NzRhMDZhODc5Yzc4NGZiNDgxZWE4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The GSR values cooperation," Reeves said, though his eyes remained calculating. "Though I'm curious why you'd look for Professor Watrous. The Moondust Crystal shares minimal connection with such individuals."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZWZlOTY4MWNhYjQ0OTk4NTUxMDU3MDRjZGIzODUx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"He escaped Stardust Command," Lorna replied. "We have reason to believe he's after the same thing we are."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZmE5ZjQ5ZDgwNzQ5YWNhNjVlYWE4ZTYzY2RmN2Ey"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Ah. The Fenris Horde he serves." Reeves' expression shifted. "Mac was brilliant before his transformation. Close to understanding how the Radi-Mons integrated consciousness with their tech." He paused. "Cross-reference his papers with 'Yosemite excavations'."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZDI0MGZmMGJhMjQxYzE4YTEzNTBlNzhlZDgwMjFk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As Xin typed the new search terms, movement caught his eye.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMTM2MzRmNWMxODQxNjRiMDU5ZTRiZjVhMzhkNTVi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Håkon had crawled down from his perch and positioned himself beside the keyboard. The young Diabolisk hunched his back, copying Xin's posture perfectly, and began tapping his tiny claws on the table in rhythm with Xin's keystrokes.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmY2I4OGM1Mzg1YzQ2NTFhNmM0NzdiMDIwMGFkYTRh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Look at him," Lorna smiled despite the tension.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjODVhN2E0MjQ0MTQxZmY5MGM2Y2JjZmNmMjQ5YTM5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Håkon chirped proudly, his claws clicking faster as if he too was searching the database.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5N2FjOTJmNjFkNTRmYmZhMGNlN2VhMDhkODIyODcw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Want to learn how to code, boy?" Xin grinned. "I'd need Pawan here to help with the lessons."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTZhNDM5NzdlMjQ4MjZiYjk2MDk4MTMzY2IwNmM4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Didn't bring your drone?" Lorna asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMGU3MTA2M2M5ZDRkNzk4YTY3NGEwZjE5ODE5YzUw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Left it back at Stardust Command. Was working on some upgrades for…medical sensors." Xin stroked his chin before resuming his typing.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOGRmOTVhMDE0ZjQwNzliOTQxMjc0MWEzZTFkYzRk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"That tab there — that's the one." Reeves said, highlighting a section on screen with his cigarette. "Watrous published this last November, three months before leaving for Chicago. 'Theoretical Applications of Nirboh Artifacts in Modern Computing.'"</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YTBiOWQ3NmJkYzQ5NjY4MTBmOTRkZTM5NGE1NjM3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Uh…Nirboh?" Xin raised an eyebrow. When he paused to read, Håkon paused too, tilting his head at the same angle.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YWVhYzUzMWUyZDQ2MWY4NjJmYmU5MWE0N2IwYzkw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"A rumored alien race that used to live on Neptune's moons." Lorna shrugged. "Many just call them Neptunians. No one's ever seen them, though."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MGNhM2VlOTZiNjQ2YTA4Nzg1NzQ5NmFjODdmODc3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Our scholars believe that the Nirbohs created the Moondust Crystal — then constructed Osram the Moon to conceal it from the Earth civilizations." Reeves gestured with his cigarette, the smoke rendered clearly in the air but without smell.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYjk0NGMzZDk3OTQwOWJiNDg2MWM4NWU1Y2I3MDQw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Moon is artificial. Right." Lorna remarked sarcastically, shaking her head. "And the Sun is placed in the sky by the ancient goddess Sol."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NWVmYTNmYzE1MTRiY2RhODcxN2ZjMGI1ODUwNTlj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"There were argument that the Moon is too large to be Earth's natural satellite, though." Xin said, pushing his glasses as his eyes scanned the abstract. "Here's something. Blue-colored unknown mineral housed at southern Yosemite. Serial number NH-2247-SH."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OGM2Njk5N2NhYjQ5NDJhMDM5OThjMTViM2UyMTZh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Think that could be our shard?" Lorna breathed, leaning closer. Her perfume - lavender with a hint of something else - momentarily distracted him. "Suspected Nirboh Artifact, discovered 2247."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MDUyZDZhMGQyMTRhZjE5MmZiN2QzNDk5NTIxMDM5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">" — Immovable object, reason unknown. Labeled 'Sensitive Info', confidetial level 'High'." Xin read out loud as his finger traced the screen.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYzcwNTRhMDRjZDQ2NzdhMWRlMzAxODMzOGI0YTg1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The entire valley has been...problematic since certain parties began experimenting there." Reeves confirmed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTAxYjgwNzA2ZDQ0N2E5NzdhNTUwMzFhOGZmZjFl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Problematic?" Xin pressed, but noticed Reeves' expression had changed - less helpful politician, more like calculating businessman.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZDUwZWZjYTYwNDRjODNiNWQ4YzlkMjAxYTI4NGI5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Classified information. Even for our new allies." His smile didn't reach his eyes. "But I can tell you the GSR military lost an entire platoon there in '86. The official report blamed equipment failure."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MThkMmExMjdjMDQxOGI4ZDFhODk4YzhiNjFmZjli"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna and Xin exchanged glances. "And the unofficial report?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM0Y2UzZjQ3NjdmZjRkYzQ4OTU1NWFkODJlM2VkZWI4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Doesn't exist." Though Xin's sharp hearing caught something. Reeves' tone suggested it very much did. "Continue your search. I'll provide what assistance I can."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDZhZjcwN2Y1NTQ4YTBhZWEyMTZlODA5YjYxM2Fh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As Xin dug deeper into the classified files, more pieces emerged. Photos showed Watrous younger, still human, standing beside a blue crystalline object the size of a toddler socked into the ground. One that seemed to shimmer even in still images.</span></p><span class="cjM3NzZjMDg2NWNjOTQ4YTg5NjJlYzM1OGFiNDU4YTFj"><br/>This story has been stolen from Royal Road. If you read it on Amazon, please report it<br/></span>
<p class="cnM4ZDRmZjhjYTZjMDRhY2Q4ZTJjZWFkYTRjY2RhNzU4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"That's our shard, alright." Xin pulled up a financial record on another tab. "Three weeks before Watrous went underground, he ordered specialized equipment. Resonance scanners, bio-neural interfaces, and..." he frowned. "Sixty gallons of synthesized Helionite?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNzVhYzFhY2FjNzQ4MzU4MzA0MmUyMGE3ZjQxMzI2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"He was planning to feed whatever he summoned," Lorna concluded. "The Fenris Horde loves that stuff."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMGI3ZGViYzQ0ZjRiNGQ5YjY4NWJkYTA0ZDBlYzVh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Before Reeves could respond, Håkon's playful chirping turned into a warning trill. The young Diabolisk abandoned his typing game, scales darkening to deep blue as he pressed against Lorna's arm, tiny claws digging into her trench coat's sleeve.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MjE4N2MxNjllMzQxZDA4ZWNlNGM2NzVlMDFjNzQz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"¡Madre de Dios!" Diego's voice echoed from two floors up. "We've got movement in the ambient signatures. The sensors are going loco!"</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YzA2OTQzODkyODRiMTRiMWZmNTM2NTM0OTIxNjU4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The terminal screen flickered, lines of code racing across it faster than human eyes could follow. When it stabilized, a massive three-eyed Kraken filled the display, its brown flesh glistening, arms writhing.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZjQyOWJmODEzOTQ2ZjhiM2NjY2YxMjM4YzZkNDg3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Professor Watrous and our newly converted scholars have shared much knowledge with us." the creature's words appeared as text before being voiced through the library's speakers. "We've learned to navigate your information systems as easily as the ocean depths."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMGQyMTU2YTk1ZDQ4NjliZjYzOTE0NzFjYTQ4YWZm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Like hell," Lorna muttered, hand moving to Baldr at her belt.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMDA2YWY1OTg0YTRjNGRhYjc3NmM4NzIzYjU3NDhi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Ah, Primarch Skarn's prize," the Kraken's central eye focused on her through the screen. "He speaks of you often, Lorna Weiss."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYjg1OGI0YmQ0ZDRmYzJiYTQwOTg5MzM4MGMyMTk3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna's face went pale, her hand unconsciously moving to her stomach. Xin felt a surge of protective anger.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NTQyNDY4OTM2MjRhODBhNDA5OWY0ZDU4ZmNiZmIy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Shut up," he snapped at the screen, fingers flying across the interface to start data transfer to his flash drive.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NmI2NjUyOGYxZDQ3ZjQ5Y2Q5YjE5NzViNDA2ZWE4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Kraken's attention shifted to him. "And the mate-surrogate. Perhaps one worth converting to a Draug, as well?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMGMxY2ZlYmVhYzQwZjY5NzU0MWQxZjFlZjRlZWEz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"In your dreams!" Xin's hands moved faster, running defensive protocols while starting the download.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOGRjZGYwY2RhMDRhNTVhYWY5N2E4ODc5N2YxYmRm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Reeves!" Lorna's voice was firm despite her pallor. "Can your systems help?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZDM3NDhmMWQwODQ1YTBhMGY3NjRmOWJhYzM1NGQy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"My projection has no admin access," the hologram said, stepping back slightly. "But being a technician in my younger days, I can guide you."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwODFlOGUyMDBhNTRkM2JhMTNlM2IxODgzNjc5YjRh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Guide us?" Xin asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMTBiY2IzMzJkODRmNTc5NzRlOGY0YTdhN2EyOGEx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Kraken will try to corrupt your download through packet injection. Set up mirror nodes, command prompt 'lambda-seven-seven.' It's an old Digital Era trick." Reeves said before drawing on his cigarette.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOTI4YTEyZDY4MDRlNzg4ZTBiNTFiNTdlODcxNTIy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Glass shattered on the floor below, the sound echoing through the library. The stench of decay wafted up through the climate control systems - rotting flesh mixed with something chemical and wrong. Through the clear floor panels, Xin could see Bone Fiends emerging from maintenance tunnels, their exposed vertebrae clicking as they moved.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZGZjMTliZjZlYjRkNDU4NzIyNzMzYWEwMjFjOWU4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Outside, the golden-armored Pomo Wardens opened fire, their neural disruptors creating nets of blue energy. But more creatures emerged - Skuggrs with their insect forms.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YzgwMjdhNzAyMzQ2NmFhNzA3MTYxYjhmMjgwM2U2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A young Warden, barely out of training by the look of him, tried to dodge the Skuggr's acid spray. The corrosive stream caught his shoulder, eating through the golden composite plating.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNzQyNzQ0NTBmOTQ2ZDk4ZDI2NDI3ZWI0MTUwYjY3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Eric! Get him some Medi-Vap!" his squadmate called out, dragging him behind cover while still firing one-handed. Another Warden rushed forward with what looked like a can of neutralizer spray, but a second Skuggr burst from the wall behind them, delivering a pincer attack, streams of acid bile dissolving metal as their giant mandibles bit into their prey. The two Californians never made it.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNTRjYjBhYzdkMjQ0Yzk4Mjg5NGU2NjllMGFmMTJm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Through the transparent panels, Xin watched as another Warden - her golden helmet gleaming with integrated sensors - coordinated her squad with crisp hand signals. "Sectors three through seven, establish overlapping fields!"</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZWEyNjBlZGI2NTQ4MGJhNTE3YTA3ZWRmZTlkNDky"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A neural disruptor hummed as the nameless woman laid down suppressing fire, the blue energy nets forcing a pack of six Bone Fiends to scatter. Two other Wardens moved in synchronization, their training evident in how they covered each other's blind spots, balls of photon energies shattering the Fiends.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDMwYzM5MGE2MTQyZmFiNjk0NGFiZGNlZDZmOTRk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Thirty percent downloaded!" Xin reported, using Reeves' mirror node suggestion while typing furiously.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNmUzYzgyZGJiNDQ2MGRiMTdjYTZiODMzMWMwYTE5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Kraken's arms pressed against the edge of the screen, as if testing for weaknesses. "Admirable. But we'll secure the data while you perish."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYjg5MjFmZWRmYTQ3NDg5OGZiZDQ3YjNiZDU2NmNi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Håkon had taken a defensive position now, no longer playing but watching the stairs with reptilian intensity.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNGJkOWZiZWM1YTQ3YzBiOWZmMTM1OTU1ZjhjOTRh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna stood up fluidly. She drew the Psi Shield Device from Xin's jacket pocket and fitted it to his ear without asking. "<em>Vacuus Arcanum Custos</em>," she murmured in Ordovox, the Void spell activating the shield.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YjkwZDFkYzlhYjQ0OTBiNzE5ZGMwNjFmNTAwYWZj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Thanks!" Xin replied, glancing at her.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOGVjNzBkZjUyODQxZDY5NDAxN2M3Y2NkYTAwMGRi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Keep working, I'll handle the rest." she said, drawing Baldr from within her trench coat. The Psytum Sword's quantum blade hummed to life, casting blue shadows across her face.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZGY3MmU4YTVmYjQ2YmU4YzZmZTE0YTFlN2ViZWE3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Actually, the mirror nodes are self-replicating now!" Xin got up from his chair. His fingers flew across the terminal one last time. A progress window appeared, showing the download proceeding on its own.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OWZmZTZhNTRmNjQxYWY4MDk2ZGE1NjgwYTFiNjk2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The screen split into multiple partitions, each one showing identical progress bars advancing in parallel. Even if the Kraken could somehow corrupt one stream, the others would continue.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOWM2NzllMmFjNjRmNjg5OWNjOWY3ZGFmYTFhZmYw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Smart!" Lorna's approval made his chest swell with pride.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ODJiNmE0OGMwYjRhNGNhYTZiMzM1NGVjMDc3M2Ex"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I'll help with the fight." He said.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NjZlNmU5OTExNjQwOTliNTJlM2JiZGEyODg4NDE2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Your Kinetic SMG, then." she nodded toward Kuma, the white compact machine gun on his back. "Remember what Manny and I taught you. Breathing control, center mass, squeeze don't pull."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MGVjMjBmZmZmNzRhM2JhOWMwYWVjZTc5YTcxNGU1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">He grabbed the weapon, nodding. The grip felt familiar now. "Got this side covered."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNzE5NzJlOWFhNDQyYmY5OWRjYjBhNzM3NzNkMDY5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Good." She drew Váli with her left hand, checking the magazine. "Because here they come."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZmUzMzU1NjVjYTQ1YzNhMjJlNTgxZTQ2NGM3OTVj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The first wave hit. A Bone Fiend burst through a maintenance panel twenty feet away, its canine skull wreathed in darkness. Xin raised Kuma, breathed out slowly and squeezed the trigger. A seven-round burst caught the creature center mass, electromagnetic rounds punching through its ribcage. It dropped instantly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YzY4ZTBjMjc0MjRiY2Q5Mzc2YjcyMDI2ZDQ4YjQ2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Another emerged from the same panel - Xin adjusted his aim left, fired, watched it fall. His groupings were tighter now, more confident. The hours of practice from last night were paying off.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Mjk1M2M4NWYwZTRjZDk4MjYxNmIyZmE3NzIwNmZi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Nice shooting for an engineer," Reeves observed. "Probably spending too much ammo, however —"</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMmVhYzM2NzYyMDQ1YzFiNWVkNWJjYjM4ZWFiNTJi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Duck!" Lorna shouted.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYzNiYTI3ODI3ZDQ1NzdhM2IyOWJiZmIwZTNkYzZi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin dropped as a Skuggr's acid stream sizzled overhead, melting through an irreplaceable section of 20th-century wood paneling.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NDc2OWI4ZDg3MTRlY2ZhN2RjMmI0YzMxNWYxZDdl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Raising his left hand, he pointed a palm at the Radi-Mon and chanted in Devavāṇī. "<em>Śūnyatā Śāntih!</em>"</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZGExMDcyN2E0ZDQ2YjY5ZGRkMjQ3MzZhZjcyZWJi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Skuggr stumbled back as green energies wrapped around its torso, visible cracks forming on its shell as it spat out an acidic stream to retaliate.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZjdjZGQzMDRhOTQzNzliMjk0NTQ4NWI1Zjc4ZTM4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Nervously, Xin dodged left, came up on one knee, and squeezed the trigger hard to put eleven rounds through the creature's head. The creature fell.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNWY5Njg2ZDdmMjQ3M2I5Mjc1NjBlOWVlZDUzZDRi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Beside him, Lorna moved through the library, using columns and reading desks as pivot points. Baldr carved through two Fiends in a single flowing motion, leaving azure trails of energy. Váli, her 10mm Magnum, sounded twice - precise shots that dropped a third target before it could close the distance.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3M2NlNTg2MWYzMTQ0Yzc4MzU1YjVmNWYyMGQ3MWZj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Fifty-three percent!" Xin called out between bursts of gunfire.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0Y2Y3MjhlZWQxNTQxNTNiNTU3OGQ4OTI4ZTEyNzIw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Suddenly, a figure rounded the corner - not charging like the Fiends, but walking with purpose. Its partially melted flesh still bore recognizable features beneath the corruption. The university ID badge hanging from its neck read 'Marcus Chen, Computer Science', and the eyes that fixed on Xin glowed with intelligence. This was no mere zombie.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NzRkNzhlZjgxZjRlYzI4N2I1Y2NkZGJiNzI3MmE2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"A fellow programmer?" the Draug's voice rasped like grinding stone. "Your knowledge will enhance the collective."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZjFiNWNiZTc3ODQwMDY5NGJlNDdjMDlkNTAzMmQw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin raised Kuma and fired - six rounds. The bullets struck true, but the Draug merely staggered, dark ichor seeping from wounds that began closing immediately.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNmU5NjVkYjFmMDRjNWM4ZWRlZDk3NmM4MDgyMTM3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"<em>Járn-önd!</em>" The Draug exhaled, and the air itself became weapons, sand forming around it to disintegrate the subsequent bullets that Xin fired.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTY2ODM2N2RhMjQ3OTFiMDA4M2ExOGM1ZDkyY2Iw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Then, blades of compressed sand formed from the barrier, slashing toward him.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNjYxMmU4YWIwOTQxZTJiM2RlMGE5YTY0MzUxODUz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">He dove left, feeling the attack whistle past. His Psi Shield flickered as one blade grazed it, draining his Aether to prevent what would have been a severed arm. Heart hammering, Xin came up firing, trying to buy time.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwM2NlZjE5NDVhOTQyZWU4ZTliZDRmMzkxMDEwYzA5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"<em>Śūnyatā Śāntih!</em>" He attempted the same nullification spell, focusing on the Draug.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YTU1MjQzMmMyODRmNTI4NDUzMmZlODkzYTU0NjRm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">But the spell's green light struck the creature harmlessly. The Draug laughed - an ugly, wet sound. "Newly awakened. Your Void calls to mine, but you lack depth." It raised one partially skeletal hand. "<em>Beinaklifr!</em>"</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YmVhYTQxNjJmMjRiNmI4OTM2NGRjN2Q3MDMzZjU5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Ghostly fingers erupted from the floor, grasping at Xin's ankles. He jumped back, but one caught his shoe, its grip crushing. Panic flared as he realized how outmatched he was. The Draug advanced, each step deliberate.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZTUzMmZjNDFkMTQ1MWQ5NGVkODRiZDNjMDBjY2Y4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I won't give up!" he managed to gasp, raising his gun once again. More bullets. He squeezed the trigger hard, prepared to emptying the magazine.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MzllM2ZkMDliYTQ1Mzc5YTI0MGJmOTUyMjI5Yzlh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Draug walked through the shots raining down at him before raising a mutated arm to intone in Jǫturmál. "<em>Kyrrð Ginnungagaps!</em>"</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYjAwYTBlMmFmYTQ3Njc4NTU4NzhhNTVjMDdjMWM4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The world went silent. Not quiet - completely, utterly silent. Xin's shots made no sound. His breathing, his heartbeat - nothing.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMTM5MzIzNmI2MDQ5ZTFiNjNmYmE5MzkyNmRkYTgy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Draug's fist caught him in the ribs, lifting him off his feet. Only the Psi Shield saved him from broken bones, but he felt his Aether reserves plummet. He hit a bookshelf hard, old books cascading around him.</span></p>
