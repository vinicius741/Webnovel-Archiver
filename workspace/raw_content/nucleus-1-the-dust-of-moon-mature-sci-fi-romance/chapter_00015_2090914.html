<p class="cnMyMDA3MjkyYTAxZjQyMTY4ZjAyMzBmMTA1ZjlmNmZl"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Platinum Crescent Plaza, 28 Avenue de la Victoire, Central Business District, Abidjan, Ivory Coast, Emerald Directorate territory</span></p>
<p class="cnMzODQ5YzlmYWY1NjQ5ZTU5NTkwMzllMWI5OTI3ZWRi"><img alt="Nucleus: The Dust of Moon" src="https://nucleusseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ch14.png"/></p>
<p class="cnNhMTE4NDdjMTNiYzRkZTA4NWQ5OTA1NDJkMTZkZTRm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"<span style="font-size: 1.5em"><strong>A</strong></span>lmost there," Jabari Adomako piloted his Scarab mech through the streets of Abidjan, the cockpit filled with blinking lights.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTI0YmRmNjk5YjRlMmI5MjU2NjQ3MjRlNjM3M2Y4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The city sprawled beneath him — a mix of lights and shadows. Skyscrapers rose high above, their neon signs pulsing with the rhythm of the midnight economy.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNWJhMjJjZGQ2OTRlNWM5ZTNjNjJmZWFiNDk5ZTA2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari's Scarab moved with precision, its six legs finding grip on the urban terrain. From his cockpit, Jabari had a good view of his surroundings. Pedestrians looked small from his elevated position.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYzM0MDdiN2U1MzQ1MjliMTUzYjFhYTE3M2ViNDhi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">At the intersection of Independence Boulevard and Houphouët Avenue, the traffic control system brought him to a halt — even military mechs had to respect civilian infrastructure.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTE2MGEwZmU1YzQxZTFiNzYyM2NhMWY2OTdlZGEw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Moving one to the control panel, Jabari flicked on the radio, the cockpit filling with the late-night broadcast of Radio Côte d'Ivoire. Static crackled before a smooth voice emerged.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZTMxZDQ2Njc5NzRiYjU5Yjk0YWUwYTk3Mzc1NzJk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"—and that was 'Moonlight Over Yamoussoukro' by the Lagos Synthetic Orchestra. You're listening to the Midnight Frequency, where we keep you company through the dark hours. I'm your host, Kweku, and before we continue with more neo-Afrobeat fusion, let's check in with the news."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNWI1MWJlMjVjZTRmY2NiZmY3YzFkNDcyMGEyNGFj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The music faded, replaced by a more serious tone. "Breaking news from our East Asian correspondent: chaos erupted at Taiwan's Amber Moon Spire earlier today as unknown operatives breached the ZenFusion facility. Imperial sources claim the attack was orchestrated by Terra Alliance agents, though the Alliance denies involvement. Witnesses report seeing a blonde woman in beige trench coat entering the ZenFusion facility —"</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjU1OWIxMjExNzQyOTA5MWFhMjFmM2YxNjlmZWY2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari's hands tightened on the controls. A blonde Alliance operative in Taiwan? His mind flashed to the news footage from days ago — that same blonde woman with the Psytum Sword in Chicago. Whatever she was involved in, it was escalating.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Mzk5ZjA3YzA0MjQ5MDFhNDMzODJjZDFjZjkyNjNl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Imperium of Dragons has issued a statement calling the breach an 'act of war,' while ZenFusion's stock prices plummeted by thirty percent in after-hours trading. More on this story as it develops."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTg1YWNjZTdlYTQwN2VhZWRjYTMwNTc2YTgzZGE1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The traffic light shifted to green, but Jabari lingered, listening.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYWM1MGJlMzg2OTRhNjRhZjBlOGMzM2MyMDUzMDQ2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"In related news, speculation continues to mount regarding the so-called 'Moondust Crystal.' Dr. Celine Kamara representing the Kimaris Warband spoke with us earlier today at the University of Accra."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NjBiYzU0ZGU2MDQzZDg4N2M1ZDg4YzQ4MDc3OGZi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A recorded voice, feminine and sharp, filled the cockpit: "What you're suggesting is unprecedented clash of goals between factions who are usually at each other's throats. When the Alliance and the Imperium suddenly mobilize resources toward the same goal, it suggests something far more significant than mere Zephyrium deposits. As for us — I am not at liberty to say."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmODZjMzdjNTUyMDQ2ZTdiMDdkNWFkOTE2Yjc4ZDQx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Thank you, Dr. Kamara. The Directorate's official position remains that such artifacts are purely speculative. However, our sources indicate increased military activity around key lunar installations. Now, back to the music with 'Binary Sunrise' by—"</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NjhkYTE3YTU5NTQxYzZiY2E0ZGE2NzlmZjQ3ZTUx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari switched off the radio as the Scarab resumed its march. The pieces were falling into place. That Alliance woman, the facility breach in Taiwan, the Mooondust Crystal everyone seemed to be chasing.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NDBlODZmNDUxYzRiYmQ4MDFlYTc3ODhkODcyY2M0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As Jabari's mech entered Platinum Crescent Plaza, he noticed the contrast between the old and new. Holographic ads for Medi-Vap and Indra-Sprite flickered beside murals of ancient warriors and elephant herds.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NjUyNGU2YWJmNTQxYTU5OGMxNGQ3OGE4NTEzYmQy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A figure stepped forward from the shadows — a guard in the green-and-gold uniform of the Directorate.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NjFjNjBjZGVmYTQ3MzhhMmJlNTZkZmYyNTAzY2My"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Platinum Crescent security. State your business," the guard demanded.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjA3MDhmMGY5ZjQzZjZhZTQzNDBlMzNlN2U4MDA4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Scarab's speakers amplified Jabari's reply. "Jabari Adomako, Lieutenant, reporting to the Kimaris Warband."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMWUyOWJlMGI3YTQ1MDNhNWI0ZTUwYjM2MDEwY2Vm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"So, you're the one Prince Laurent picked?" The guard scoffed. "Couldn't wait until morning to show up? Don't plan on sleeping?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMGUzNzliOGFhODQxZTVhMDY4YWQ2NzlkNGMxOTVh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I apologize, sir. My orders were to report in as soon as possible," Jabari explained. Then, he recognized the guard. "Ahmad, is that you?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OGM3ZWY5MmM5YTQzOGVhMjA3YzRkNDM5OWMzYzhl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Glad to see you remember a depot mate, buddy. Truth is, I was told to let you in no matter what time it was," the guard admitted. "Your Kimaris superiors are still awake. Working on some difficult cases."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZTI5Njc1NGY0NDRjNWU4OTEzODQwM2E0Mjg2Yzc0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Difficult cases?" Jabari asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOGQxOTMxMzRmZTRjYmFhZTYyMmQ0MDQzOTE3Y2Uy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Laurent himself. Gone missing. Went on some wild goose chase, so I've heard."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZmRkYzVmZjM1MDQzZWRhZDM2YmQ5Yzc5ZWViYmIz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Missing? As in?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDUyZmFkMmJkNzRhN2M5ZjIwYzE0NDc4M2Y5MmI5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Madam Celine can tell you more. Be careful where you park that Scarab, alright?" Ahmad said, stepping aside but still scanning the darkness.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZGVhN2Y4MWY1NDQ5ZmRhZGUwMWVlZjRlZWNlMWRh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Right. Thanks, Ahmad," Jabari nodded as he continued forward.</span></p><span class="cjBlNDc2OTlhZjRkMTRlNzJhNjVhZThhNjQyNzlhODg0"><br/>Taken from Royal Road, this narrative should be reported if found on Amazon.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNlOTE5ZDgyYjExZDRjMzhiMTFlYTIyNmRlM2UwYWIx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As the Scarab moved deeper into the plaza, Jabari's sensors highlighted several large containment units near the parking area. The sickly green glow of Helionite leaked from their seams despite the shielding.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMDMxMzczZDc0YTQ3NTA4OTcxNDYyOTVmODFhOTUx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Ahmad," Jabari called through the comm, "what are those containers doing here? That's a lot of fusion waste for a civilian plaza."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YTQ2MzhiYzY3YjQ0ZjhiOTlkMGNiNWYwYjFlYjA2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The guard glanced at the containers and sighed. "Emergency reroute from the Central Processing Plant. They had a power surge from the Summit at Golden Hall. Maintenance promised they'd be gone by morning." He shook his head. "Not great, but what can we do when them higher-ups make decisions, right?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMmMwNmU2MTBiYTQ5MjU4NGRkM2ZjOTNkNDQwMmVl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari frowned at the readings. The Helionite concentration was significant enough to register even through the containment. Basic training had taught every cadet that improperly stored Helionite was practically an invitation to...</span></p>
<p class="cnNkM2Y1MjhmYzg1NTRlMmI5ZDI5ZjAyYzAwZGMxOGI3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Suddenly, the air was filled with chaos; starting with an ominous tremor. Jabari's hands tightened on the Scarab's controls as the earth shook beneath them.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Y2RlYTQwM2IyMDRmMDM4ZWNiMWIwODAwM2ZlMzFi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Radi-Mons! Look out!" The guard's voice crackled over the comm-link, panic in his voice.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjkwMmU3MTUyNDQ2ZDU4MThmMzY1N2NiYzQxYjhm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari's heartbeat quickened, but his mind cleared. This was different from the simulations – this was real. People would die if he failed. An image of his grandmother's broken body flashed through his mind, strengthening his resolve. In reality, there was no room for overthinking – only action.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZjhkZDBiZmJjNTQyNmQ5YzBkZTgzODA5YzkxNDY2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Here they come," he replied, his voice steady despite his racing heart.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZWI1NTYwMmQxMDQ4ZWE5NmRkZWJmMjkxZTlkMmZk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Over a dozen Bone Fiends, their wolf-like forms twisted mockeries of life, erupted in a shower of debris, surrounding the plaza. Their skeletal frames moved unnaturally, drawn by the Helionite's call.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MTVmNTgzNGFlZTRkYmJiZDNlM2U5ODc2YWIxMjY4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Meanwhile, a shadow spread across the sky above. A massive form descended slowly. Three enormous eyes blinked open, revealing a creature unlike anything natural – a Kraken. The creature was a mass of long arms surrounding a bulbous body, like a mutated octopus the size of a bus.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZDFkZGI0NjYyMzQ3Yzg5ZGFhN2M4Yzg4MDI5NTI0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Skarn shall awaken!" A deep voice boomed from the creature. "He who is both devil and divine! The Blue Garden of Sinners shall bow to his power!"</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNjM5Y2QyMjg5MDRhMGQ4MDM2YzhkYzNkYjVlNGEx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Ahmad's face paled as he looked up. "Shango's Schlong, it can talk?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZDEzZTRiMDkzMTQzNjU5M2QwZmU0OWY5NTE0Njdi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"That's what Krakens do." Jabari said as his mech faced the monster. "It's here to coordinate the Fiends."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNjA0YjEyZTliZjQwNzY4M2ZlYWJmMGFiNDZjMzBj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Plaza Guards! Rally at the gate!" Ahmad raised his rifle as more guards emerged to join him, all opening fire on the Bone Fiends.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MDk0YTU2MDcyODRmZmE4YWY0MTEwZjE3ODE0ZThh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Leave some for me!" Jabari called, calculating his shots. The lives around him – Ahmad, the other guards, civilians in nearby buildings – all depended on him now. This responsibility didn't paralyze him; it focused him.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NjhjYzRlZWQ4ZDRjMDdiMzc3YTRiZTA5NjVhOGMw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Around the Scarab, multiple Ologuns in green exosuits formed a line, their Plasma Rifles firing at the Bone Fiends.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMDM0N2VjNTY5NzQxY2NhZDJlYzczODY5MDZjY2U5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">For every monster that fell, another took its place. Above, the Kraken cast down its green ichor. It fell like a curtain, trapping the guards like statues.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZjljNDY5YTc4ZDQxMzA5ZDhiNjM0MzIzZTUwZDJj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"No!" Jabari shouted, memories of his grandmother's death surging forward. The same helplessness threatened to overwhelm him, but he pushed it down. He was not that frightened child anymore.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOGVjYTgzZmYxMjQ4M2U4YzJiM2RjZDEwOTA0NjE4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">His fingers moved across the control panel, bringing the Scarab's weapons online. Armored plates on the mech's head slid open, revealing its gun.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNWY5NTFjMGExZjRjMDk5MGE4YWEyMzZiNjA5M2Vh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Plasma Spitter, engaged!" he warned the guards as he aimed at the nearest Bone Fiends.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ODdlNzE2MDQxNDRlMGU5ZDAxNTQzZTFiODY1ODA0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">But his racing heart disrupted his aim. His first shots went wide, hitting the row of fusion-powered cars parked along the plaza's edge.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOTI5NmNhNTk4OTQwZjJhNzczZDUxM2E0OTEzMmVm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The vehicles exploded in fireballs that threw shadows across the plaza. Alarms wailed, and lights flashed, illuminating the battlefield.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZmMxZmFiZjI0MjQwYjVhNDkzNWU1NTZiOGRiZmUy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Lion's loins!" Jabari muttered, the swear doing little to calm him. He took quick breaths as he fought with the controls. He hadn't made such a basic error since his first days of training.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzE0ZjFlMjBlYjQwY2Y5Y2QzMzY5MGNlMWUwZTA2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Bone Fiends surged forward, sensing weakness. They swarmed the trapped guards, tearing at them with inhuman hunger. Blood spread across the plaza.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MDg4NjU1MWYwNzRjMmM4MjM3ZjlkODczYmI1NTMx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari watched, his heart heavy. Was this happening again? People dying while he did nothing? Just like that night in rural Ghana, when the Bone Fiends had torn through their village, when his grandmother had pushed him into a storage cellar and locked it from outside, sacrificing herself.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Mjk5NjA1NmMzMDRhMmQ5NzkwOTY2ODM0YTlmMzll"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">But today would be different. Today he had the power to fight back.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTg4ZGU5NWVjMjQ2YjliMzM1YWQyNjE0ZWM4Nzli"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari's Scarab rose up as Bone Fiends climbed onto its armored legs. Their claws scraped against metal as Jabari drove the Scarab forward in a charge.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYzZiOTE1YThlODRmYjhhZTY3Zjk1YjA1YWJjMGEy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The ground shook under the mech's weight. Its legs crushed the Radi-Mons beneath. Bone shattered against steel.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOGI0NDUwZWQ1ZDQ1YzlhNTU3Nzk4MDE0MGI3MmU4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"For the Directorate!" he growled, pushing aside his fear. Jabari focused on the Kraken hovering above, its arms spread wide. He moved his hand to another weapon control.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YzRlZDYxNDY0ZTQzMzZhZTY2OTYwZWNmNGQ0M2Zm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Sun Moon Cannon powered up, panels opening on the Scarab's head. A beam of golden and blue energy shot forth, cutting through the air. His hasty aim wasn't perfect, but the blast hit the Kraken.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZTRhODkyYjUyYzQ0ZjlhMjEwZTQxNzU2NmU1YThj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Losing two arms, the creature let out a pained shriek. Wounded, it floated higher and retreated, leaving a trail of glowing blood. "Savor your small victory, Earth-Dwellers. The Day of Oblivion will come."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMTlhZTcxYjRlMDRiYjI5ZTRlYWYyZDQ1MzBhZDBh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Silence returned to the plaza as the battle ended, leaving behind destruction. Ahmad, battered and covered in the Kraken's green goo, approached the Scarab. His voice was hoarse and tired.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNDNmYjAxNGJkZTRlNDRhZmFhYzQ0N2ZlMDAyNGY5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Anansi's ass, Jabari!" he scolded as he limped forward. "Look what you did to the parking lot! What kind of Scarab Rider are you, shooting at a damn parking lot?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMyN2UyZTFkN2NkMDQ1YTBhYWEzOGE4YzZmNzZmZjNi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari opened the cockpit, climbing down to face Ahmad. "Sorry," he said, regret in his voice. "I got distracted. Remembered something I shouldn't have in combat."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NTdkYzEwNTliMzQ2MjViYzhiZTg1MDI3MzA4YWI3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Ahmad studied him, recognition in his eyes. "The Kumasi Incident? I heard about what happened to your grandmother. Half the cadets at the depot knew."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZjMxOTdjNzY3MzQ0ZTliMzU2ZTA2ODE3NDE0ODli"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari stiffened. He never talked about it, but of course, word had spread. "Yeah," he replied quietly. "It was a small village outside Kumasi. I was…nevermind."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MzdlZjY5ZDdiNjQwZGZiZDk0N2YyNTNjNjhiOTVj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Well, at least I'm still alive to write up a report on this," the guard said more gently. "If it weren't for you and your Scarab, my men would be Radi-Mon food now. Just like..."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNmViOTlkZmMyOTRjMTc5M2ViZmMwMzU5M2MwMzYw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Just like my grandma," Jabari finished. "That's why I'm here, Ahmad. So what happened to her doesn't happen to anyone else."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYzQyN2UzYTY0YzRmZGVhMGJkZjg1N2ZmYjQ2M2M0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Ahmad nodded, respect in his eyes. "Power down your Scarab, Lieutenant," he said, pointing to a golden skyscraper towering above them. "See this golden skyscraper? The Topaz High-Rise. The Kimaris Warband is waiting for you on the sixty-sixth floor."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMWNiMDk2MjA0NjQyOTliMWQwNTk5YmUzMzc5NGU1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I thought that might be their HQ." Jabari looked at the skyscraper.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Yjc1ODhmYmU3ODRiNjc5N2IwNjQ3Njg4OThmYjI2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Go on now, I'll take care of everything else."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTdiNWIxZTA1ZDQyNzc4ZmQ3ZDE0ZTM0MWFlNTk2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari nodded, encouraged by the understanding in Ahmad's eyes. The Scarab powered down with a hum as Jabari headed for the exit.</span></p>
