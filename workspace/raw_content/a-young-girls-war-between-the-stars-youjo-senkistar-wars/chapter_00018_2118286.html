The impostor’s body flickered and changed, dispelling like someone shut off a hologram as blaster bolts passed through where Bo-Katan’s chest and head would be—revealing Tanya standing in her place, those bolts having gone well over her head. That didn’t matter now though—she was revealed, and now the others had rallied, taking up firing positions as they now had the enemy clearly in their sights and out from in the middle of them.</p>

I pulled his belt on over my robe and used his own knife to punch some new holes through it to resize it for my waist. I kept his blaster and holster on it and found a second holster for the blaster I’d taken from the redheaded Kryze girl. The armor, I lumped together and stuck his helmet on top of, before dumping it in the ship I’d be taking. Then I went over the battlefield, repeating the process—indulging in the time honored tradition of looting the dead.</p>

I needed to practice more using the multi-saber techniques Ajunta Pall’s projection had been teaching me, in concert with my shields and other abilities. If I had picked one and stuck to it, or only used one flying saber, I would have had more mental bandwidth for more shields. The problem with that was, without the shock and awe of being able to intimidate them by projecting the feelings from my own memories of the Great War, along with taking out so many of their number so quickly with the extra swords combined with a blaster, they </span><em>would</em><span style="font-style: normal"> have rallied and just worn me down.</span></p>
