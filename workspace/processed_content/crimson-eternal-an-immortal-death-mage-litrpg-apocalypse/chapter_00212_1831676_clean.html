   Because someone did that a few weeks ago. On a post where they could just click the word here to see the art, they went and made a support ticket to get the Royal Road staff to tell me that the art was broken on a post I already knew the art was broken on. Because the reader couldn't comment on the post to tell me. Bothering the staff in the process for no reason.
