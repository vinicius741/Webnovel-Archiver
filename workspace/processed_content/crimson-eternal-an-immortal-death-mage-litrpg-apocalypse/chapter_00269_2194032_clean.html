  The instant the universal notification rings out, every last person in the universe freezes in place. Then the memory block on those who have lived long enough to know about the previous birth lifts, and pandemonium immediately spreads through the people. Whether it’s from those with their memories unsealed or those who are told about the Demon King by those with their memories unsealed.
 </p>
<p>
  All of the smaller nations who were fearful of the Grands and other top Alpha Tier nations that were preparing for military action quickly come to understand their purpose. Meanwhile those citizens of the top Alpha Tier worlds begin to put in complaints to their nations about their memories being sealed.
 </p>
<p>
  Only to be told by their nations that it is the System’s own doing. That the System seals the memories of all those below a certain level of the Demon King until the Demon King’s birth and a decade after their death.
 </p>
<p>
  But not every user of the System panics at the news.
 </p>
<p>
  All four of the Horsemen show different reactions strongly varying from those of the regular users.
 </p>
<p>
  Death ignores it all to go back to sleep.
 </p>
<p>
  Pestilence finds the fallen demons intriguing enough to begin capturing a few for use as test subjects in his experiments. But he simply ignores the existence of the Demon King other than that, having already known about his imminent arrival to the universe yet also having not cared about it.
 </p>
<p>
  War leaps for joy as he immediately cancels all of his planned wars and begins searching the universe for the Demon King to force him into a duel.
 </p>
<p>
  And Famine slams his fist into the armrest of his throne while gritting his teeth in anger before sending out the full force of his army in search of the Demon King. The man himself despising the idea of anyone else trying to lay claim to the Horsemen’s superiority within the universe.
 </p>
<p>
  Meanwhile the Demon King himself emerges on top of a massive planet that hadn’t been there before his birth. A planet made entirely of demonic energy. The energy responsible for his birth in the first place.
 </p>
<p>
  The Demon King of this generation has black and purple skin with two draconic horns, two draconic wings on his back, and the occasional hint of black and purple scales across his body. And when he slowly opens his equally draconic eyes, naked as the day he was born – which was moments ago – a cloak made of demonic energy appears over his body.
 </p>

  Stolen story; please report.
  <br/>

<p>
  A few seconds pass as the Demon King looks around at the demonic planet beneath him. One covered in a thick black and purple mist with billions of fallen demons of all sorts appearing within the mist across the planet.
 </p>
<p>
  Eventually the Demon King raises his gaze from the planet and looks out into the universe. And through his ability to link with all of his fallen demons, he immediately takes a look at each of the Horsemen in turn. One after another.
 </p>
<p>
  A grimace appears on his face, however, at the sight of War and his current actions. As inherent memories belonging to his predecessors and all of their dealings with the Horseman of the Apocalypse flood his mind.
 </p>
<p>
  From the times they were all chased wherever they went by the battle maniac in the Horseman’s attempts to force them into a duel. With some of those attempts even succeeding and leading to the ends of two previous Demon Kings.
 </p>
<p>
  As for when he sees Pestilence, he merely feels slightly irritated by the sight of the Horseman already beginning to experiment on his fallen demons. But he otherwise decides to ignore the White Rider, as he understands from his memories that the White Horseman never bothers with the Demon Kings beyond a potential visit to study their body once he is finished with his demons.
 </p>
<p>
  When he turns his attention to the Horseman of Famine, he feels his irritation rising again. Because the mere sight of the Horseman with the superiority complex gives the Demon King a headache.
 </p>
<p>
  The Black Horseman has always been one of the biggest thorns in the past Demon Kings’ sides, even if the man has never directly challenged the Demon Kings to a fight personally. Instead sending his own starving armies out to fight the demons of the Demon Kings. While also turning the demons into Famine’s own soldiers.
 </p>
<p>
  The Demon King eventually sighs and shakes his head before finally turning his attention to the newest Horseman of the Apocalypse.
 </p>
<p>
  The only Horseman that didn’t exist during any of his predecessors’ rules.
 </p>
<p>
  But no matter how hard he tries to search, he can’t find Death.
 </p>
<p>
  The Demon King narrows his eyes and continues searching over the course of an entire day as the demonic world beneath him gradually stabilizes and the mist spreads in a more even coat across the world. And even with all of that searching, he still fails to find her.
 </p>
<p>
  Then he finally realizes why he can’t find her.
 </p>
<p>
  Because the fallen demons, unlike himself, can only see things through life force.
 </p>
<p>
  And it is highly possible the Horseman of Death doesn’t have any life force.
 </p>
<p>
  He frowns at the thought of there being a Horseman out in the universe that he can’t keep track of. But after a few seconds, he decides to put his worries of the Horseman of Death out of his mind.
 </p>
<p>
  After all, the Horseman of Death was only born nearly two hundred years prior to his own birth. And the Horsemen are born at level one like regular humans.
 </p>
<p>
  Unlike the Demon King.
 </p>
<p>
  So even if the Horseman of Death tried to attack him, they wouldn’t be able to do anything to him.
 </p>
<p>
  With that thought in mind, the Demon King spreads both of his arms out and opens his mouth. Then every last fallen demon in the universe repeats his words for everyone to hear.
 </p>
