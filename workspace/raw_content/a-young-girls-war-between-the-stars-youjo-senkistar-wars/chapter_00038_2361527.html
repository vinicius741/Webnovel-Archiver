<p class="cnM2MjRlOTJjOTk2YjQyMzdiOTdiYmFiOGI1MDBhYWJm" style="margin-bottom: 0">The Serenno sun beat down on the open-air docking bay and turned the sheet-metal floor into a low-grade griddle that shimmered with heat haze. The air stank faintly of scorched durasteel, engine lubricant, and ozone discharge from the nearby traffic lanes. Work droids wheeled past in sluggish routines, and somewhere back, repulsor-lifts thrummed as they carried starships between levels.</p>

<p class="cnM2NjkzZWU1YWYzMzRlMmNhN2IwNTdjYzA1OGJiYTg0" style="margin-bottom: 0">The mechanic, Cindy, looked like the kind of woman you’d find on a pin-up poster lounging half-naked on a swoop bike: a busty blonde in oil-smudged booty shorts and mustard-yellow leather jacket crop top, topped off with a much abused and faded red cap. Neither hid the long strings of the salmon pink bikini she wore underneath. The weather was indeed hot, but showing this much skin was too much. Her entire slim midrift was showing for Force’s sake!</p>

<p class="cnNlMThjNTA1NDdhMTQ0ZmRhNDYwNTgzYTVmZjllNjFi" style="margin-bottom: 0">My eye twitched as I wondered if the workshop sent me a booth babe instead of an actual mechanic because of how much I'm a big spender. Completely understandable from a business’ perspective, but as someone who was familiar with a marketing department’s playbook, it didn’t fill me with confidence with the quality of their services rendered.</p>

<p class="cnMxNDY2Y2Y0ZDFlMzQwMmU5YTc4MzM1OGFjNDIzNjQ2" style="margin-bottom: 0">Her finger tapped the tablet for the next item. “The transponder flips off with a switch, right on your dash. Same with the running lights. You wanna disappear, you disappear.”</p>

<p class="cnNkNjljYWYxYzVkMzRiYjFhMzY0ZmU2NTBjODA2ZGMx" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Anchors top and bottom,” she went on, tapping the tablet again. “Mag clamps tuned for low-grav insertions, hull-conformal design so they don’t snag on a hard break. I personally handled the penetrators—bites into composite plating like a Serenno spine-wolf on a piece o’ meat. The rest of the ship’ll fall apart before the anchors give.”</p>

<p class="cnNiYTk5ZjQ4YmY2ODQ4ZDU5OGVmN2FjMjFhMWVmMzZm" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Perfect.” I peered under the hull, nodding at the subtle housing mounts and microthruster ports nestled in the seams in the platings.</p>

<p class="cnNiMDYxOTQxM2NmYjQyOTA5MDQzOGNmYWVkYTk5OTY1" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Port’s also hotter for your astromech,” she added. “We upgraded the socket to sync better with your tin can’s neural core. With that kind of connection, you take a hit hard enough to knock you out, and your droid can fly you home on half a nav array—assuming the sublight motivators aren’t in pieces.”</p>

<p class="cnNhNDMwODkyODNmMTQwZDM5ZjNmZDdmOWM2NzQ0ZjY2" style="margin-bottom: 0">Finally, I signed my name on the bottom to confirm receipt and handed the pad to her. “Excellent work. I look forward to seeing this quality on my other ship.”</p>

<p class="cnM4OTczYWE4NjQxYjQzYTU5ZTBmM2M3MGMzOTVhYzE0" style="margin-bottom: 0">Glancing over at the<em> Rusted Silver</em>, I continued, “This isn’t a slight against your work, nor do I believe you to be untrustworthy. However, I need to use my astromech and I don’t feel comfortable leaving the ship open where anyone can walk in without someone to watch it. I will be gone most of the day, so I need to know if that’s feasible.”</p>

<p class="cnNkNmI4MzE5ZmIwZTQ1MjM4NGVkYWU1YTI5OGI4ODQ0" style="margin-bottom: 0">The blonde woman nodded, reaching up and scratching at her cheek, leaving behind a black grease streak. “We’re done with the interior work for now. Have to go back to it eventually, but for today, we can focus on exterior stuff.”</p>
<p class="cnNhNzYxMzNhNzM3OTQ4YTg5NjI3MGJlZjA3OTJjZDg4" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM1NmM1NDVjMmRmMDQ0ZGE4NmMyMjVkOWY4ZjAwZjYy" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Thank you. I appreciate your understanding,” I sent her a smile.</p>

<p class="cnM3NzNjZWQwM2JjODQwZWU5OWE1NzBmYzJmOWJmM2M5" style="margin-bottom: 0">Cindy nodded awkwardly and we made our way over to the <em>Rusted Silver—</em><span style="font-style: normal">her to recall her droids from inside, me to get my vac suit and armor on, arm up, and collect Arthree.

A set of controls on the armrest allowed a panel to open below the pilot to take care of the biological necessities a long flight would incur, including a small sonic scrubber for handling hygiene. </span><span style="font-style: normal">There was a small chilled storage compartment that could hold food and a bin just above it that would warm it, while on the other side was a fresh water reservoir equipped with a retractable straw for drinking.</span></p>

Even with the inertial dampener at full, between the planet’s gravity and the ship’s sudden acceleration, I found myself shoved back into my seat. It was impressive, I had to admit.
