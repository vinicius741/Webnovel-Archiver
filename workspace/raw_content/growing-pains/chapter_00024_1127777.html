So I snuck off at the first opportunity to pester Flash into another race after a quick detour. Too bad for me he was busy somewhere else.</span></p>

<p class="cnNjZGM3MDE1NWFhYjQ1MTk4MjI3NmE0ZTZlODYxYWIx"><span style="font-weight: 400">I dealt with Birdbrain enough to tolerate him and Kid Flash was just a less cool Flash. Aqualad was a new addition since the king of Atlantis joined the Justice League, but he was quiet enough that sometimes I barely noticed him.</span></p>

You made it sound like you would be gone for years.”</span></p>

<p class="cnMyNDNkZjdiNjQ5MzRkYzk5ZjlhYjdhMmVkYzIyZDdm"><span style="font-weight: 400">I rolled my eyes at him. “If you can’t fly, maybe. For me it’s just getting on and off the island and then flying for a couple hours.”</span></p>

<p class="cnNlZGZmOTlkNDRlMzQ0NWVhN2Q0MzczZjMwN2M4NWUy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Robin shrugged. “I’m eleven.” He said like that explained everything. Which it kinda did.</span></p>

<p class="cnNjZGJjYjU5ODY1YjQ2Nzc5OGQ0NjAwZTdkMGMzYzMw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, Speedy. Explain to the class what a girlfriend is.” Kid Flash jumped in.</span></p>

<p class="cnM3NTZkZjdmMzRkMjQxNzM4Nzg4MjQ0MGRmYzg4NDgy"><span style="font-weight: 400">I grinned and sat back to enjoy watching the sparks fly as the two redheads started trading insults, which eventually spread to include Birdbrain because he couldn’t control his mouth and Aqualad futilely trying to calm things down.</span></p>

<p class="cnMzNzY2M2RkNTNlNDQzMWFhZTY1MThiZjEzMTk3MTkz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mushroom treatment?” Kaldur asked. He was pretty good with surface expressions, but every once in a while he got stumped. I guess that one didn’t translate well.</span></p>

<p class="cnM5ZGI3MmI3ZjlhOTQwZDJhNzVlMjRkNjIyZTFmZDNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Being kept in the dark and fed bullcrap.” Kid Flash explained and then frowned at the archer. “And you really think our mentors do that?”</span></p>

<p class="cnMwZDNmNzYyNDMyYTQ3YWViYTM4ZjZmYmQ3ZjIzMjNk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s good for her to have ties to others her age.” Wonder Woman commented. “The main point of taking her under our wing was to give her a safe place to learn to integrate with Man’s World. Not isolate her on Themyscira.”</span></p>

<p class="cnNhNTU0MGE0ZmZhMTQ0NDA4NmNmZDAwMTg3M2NmNmEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Califa wasn’t the kind of person to stay in one place for very long. Her jaunts across North America made that obvious. And while she had met and somewhat befriended several heroes in that time, she had also made contact with criminal organizations that wouldn’t hesitate to take advantage of her thrill-seeking personality for their own gain, as seen by her involvement with an underground fight ring.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjIyMDdkN2E5OTRlZmU5ZmQ2ZTA5OTRkMzU0ZGZj"> </p>
<p class="cnM5ZmI5MDQ5NWIwMzRmMGVhY2Q2ZDdjODQ3ZjRhNzRj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Batman had already confirmed Lex Luthor was interested in the young Saiyan. And if Luthor was involved that no doubt meant several others were looking to exploit the girl as well.</span></p>

<p class="cnNkZDIwMzY1ZmJhMTRiNDU5YzJkNDExZDkwZjE4Mjlj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though the US Army had tried to keep the incident quiet, many other organizations had heard about the destroyed prototype. A few people were using that incident to secure more funding for their own projects while others were using it to call for harsher responses to alien threats.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYjM0NDg5NDVlNjQ1OWZhMzQ0ZDdlNDExYmUzNjI1"> </p>
<p class="cnM3OTljNmU5NTUwMzRmYzc4NDAzMmUzMzYwMWU0ODcw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Not to mention that several news outlets were starting to float anti-alien rhetoric as fronts for groups like Humanity First, CADMUS, Blue Cosmos, and others like them. It was lucky that Califa had almost immediately taken down a H.I.V.E. cell which took a lot of wind out of the sails of many of the more aggressive of them, but it still highlighted the need to teach the Saiyan at least how to identify the common sense others expected from her.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMDYxZjgwOTY2MzRiZjk5NjVlNmRkNDEyOGI3YWJk"> </p>
<p class="cnNlM2NlOTEzNDcxNTQ4MWRiYTc5N2Y2MDliNDdiMWFk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your mother didn’t have an issue with allowing Califa to leave the island?” Batman already knew the answer, but Themyscira had been heavily isolationist for hundreds of years. It didn’t hurt to clarify.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4M2YxMjAyYzAzYjQyNzJhYzU4OTU4NWQ3ZDYwZWQ5"> </p>
<p class="cnMwYjlhOTA0MmI3YzQ1NWJhNmRkYWYyYjllNDlhNmJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Wonder Woman shook her head. “Mother has decided we cannot shut ourselves away from the rest of the world anymore. I doubt many of my sisters will be interested in leaving for quite some time but Califa will be free to come and go…provided she listens to her teachers, of course.”</span></p>

<p class="cnM0NjcxNWU4YTAzNjQwMjZhMjM1NWY2ZTIxNjQ2OThh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Considering the martial nature of the Amazons, Califa would either be the best student they ever had or would be too busy challenging her teachers to fights to learn anything.</span></p>

It’ll be nice to have some warning before she demands a rematch for once.” Superman joked before looking back in the direction of the kids. “Though, don’t you think we should step in? A jewelry heist right before she leaves won’t be a good look.”</span></p>

On it was footage from a security camera at a themed mini-golf course, large glass decorations made to look like gemstones dotted the walls. Suddenly a familiar monkey tailed girl entered the frame and plucked one of the decorations out of the wall before flying off. “I’ll take care of the damages.”</span></p>

<p class="cnMwZTQ0NmZiY2I4ZjRlZTQ5YjMwNzRkNmVjZGU1ZjAz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Wonder Woman frowned. “Are you sure? Even if the gem is fake, Califa doesn’t have much regard for property damage. It could get out of hand.”</span></p>

<p class="cnNmZTg1ZDU3YjY4ODQxMTliOGVlNzZmNzA2MTc3Njk1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Califa tends to limit herself to match whoever she is fighting.” Batman disagreed. “As long as the sidekicks control themselves there won’t be an issue.”</span></p>
