<p class="cnM5NDZhNzgxOGZkOTQ0ZjZhOWM5OTMyMWNmOGI3MTMx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Upper Pines Campground, Former Yosemite National Park, Contested Territory</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZmU5Y2E1NzI5YTQ5YTFiZjZmNTdmYWEzNWI1MzM3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><em><span style="font-size: 1.5em"><strong>A</strong></span>zure light pulsed through darkness. Xin floated in a void where time meant nothing, where reality bent like code under a hacker's touch. A figure materialized in a white lab coat - elderly, weathered, with piercing blue eyes that matched Lorna's exactly.</em></span></p>
<p class="cnMzNjQyNGM4MjNhOTRiZDlhNmZhZjAyMDRmZjFlYWY4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><em>"Each fragment can sense the others," Harald's voice echoed from everywhere and nowhere. "And the whole hungers to be complete."</em></span></p>
<p class="cnNkZGNlYzdmMDFkYzQ4ZjZhNzdmMTZhNmJiNDU3ODdh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><em>The old man held up a crystalline shard that burned with cold fire. Behind him, shadows took form - Krabbas with golden eyes, Vyomendri's younger face, Tanha's violet beauty. They all reached for the shard.</em></span></p>
<p class="cnNlZTIyNDdmZDY0YTQwMDM4NWM5NGE2OTM4ZjgzNTM2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><em>"You carry my daughter's trust." Harald turned those weathered blue eyes on Xin. "But when the Crystal calls, will you answer? Or will you let her soul be consumed?"</em></span></p>
<p class="cnMxYmQzNjI4NjVjYzQyMWQ4YTY2YThkOWQ4MDc0ZGI5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><em>The shard in Harald's hand suddenly shattered, each piece screaming as it flew apart. One fragment shot straight at Xin's chest—</em></span></p>
<p class="cnNjNmQ0NDNjNmJjZjQ4NTQ5YWE4Zjg2MTRhMjE0YWMw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin gasped awake, his hand clutching at his heart where dream-pain still lingered. Sweat cooled on his skin despite the tent's warmth. His Quantum Watch read '08:18'.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYmVhNjEwNjk1MTRmM2U5MGY0NzkwMjIzMWNkOTNi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A soft chirp pulled him back. Håkon perched on the edge of his fold-out bed, sapphire scales catching the morning light filtering through the tent's fabric. The young Diabolisk tilted his head, studying Xin with those bright eyes, making a questioning trill.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNzQ1ZWU5ZGZiMTQ2NDA4Y2U3MjI1ZGI5ZTUzMDIy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Good morning, buddy..." Xin whispered, not wanting to wake Lorna yet. His voice came out rough.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OGJkZTc2N2Q0ZjQxMjVhMjgyMzA4NDlhOTNhYzgz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Håkon chirped again, softer this time, and carefully climbed onto Xin's chest. The Diabolisk's weight was nothing, but his presence felt solid. Tiny claws kneaded gently against Xin's shirt as Håkon settled into a protective crouch.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NjNjMmE5ZmQ4MzQwZWZhYjM3YzFjZmNlNjFiMWUx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">From the next bed, Lorna's breathing remained deep and even. In sleep, her face had softened from its usual hard edges. One arm draped over the side of her bed, fingers nearly touching the empty wine bottle from last night.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZDUxNmZkYWRjMzRjZDU5YTliMDgzNDQ0Yzc3MGJl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Space Rover's systems hummed, maintaining temperature despite the unnatural cold outside. Through the tent's ceiling panel, Xin could see frost patterns crawling across the pines — too deliberate to be natural.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhY2VkZWExMTJlYjQ0NGE4YzgwMWY4NmNkZTBiODky"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Håkon opened his mandibles in an exaggerated yawn that showed rows of developing teeth. Thanks to the Helionite he'd eaten last night, the Diabolisk's breath smelled faintly of sulfur and, oddly, mint.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMTY0ZGE4YzliZjRkNTJhZWE0OWMwZGNmNTgwODRj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Hungry already?" Xin kept his voice low. "Let me guess - eggs?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNWNkZGQzNjI5ZjQzYzc5OTAyYTgyMmI2OWEwM2Q1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Håkon's entire body wiggled with excitement, his tail creating a rapid drumbeat against Xin's ribs. The Diabolisk's scales shifted from sapphire to a brighter cyan.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkODg2ZGRjODg3ZDRlZjdiYzYwNjZiNmM4NzVkNzk3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Okay, okay, shh." Xin gently placed a finger against Håkon's snout. "We'll get breakfast soon. But first..."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NmI1YzczNDUwMjQ4ZDk5YWI1ODBiNTcxMDMzNjNi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">He carefully lifted the eager Diabolisk and set him on the heated floor. Håkon's disappointment was obvious - scales darkening, shoulders slumping like a child denied dessert.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYWI1NTUwZTBjMDQ5NTliMGYxYjJlYjYwNmU0NzI5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The sound of running water drew Xin's attention. Through the semi-opaque partition separating the tent's hygiene station, he could make out Lorna's silhouette. She was already up, steam rising around her as she stood under the sonic shower.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNTI2NGRjMjEzYTQzOTg5ODY1ZjM2MzcwZGEyMmIy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">And she was singing.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMmQ2NGFlYzhkZDRlYmQ5OWJhZDNhMGJmNDI4ZTk3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The melody drifted through the partition - the same Nordic lullaby from last night.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MjU5NDhlNjA4ZDQzYzM5YThiY2YzYzcxODgzNGRk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin found himself frozen, caught between the intimacy of the moment and looking away. The shower's dampeners weren't designed for singing, and her voice carried clearly:</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOWM0OTFiNzRhODQ5MWQ5YmE1YjMxZjUzNTUzYjEz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Og når morgenen gryr... skal vi finne vår vei... gjennom is og gjennom ild... til der håpet alltid dveler..."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMTFmYWQxZDMxMjQ3MGNhNGY3ZWY2Zjg3OTlhMTcz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Håkon had gone completely still beside him, mesmerized by his mother's voice. His scales had shifted to a deep, resonant bronze Xin had never seen before.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNjE5ZDc3ZWE4OTQ1NzQ5MTY5YzYzNzZlYzQ2YWVi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The shower shut off. Xin quickly busied himself with checking his Quantum Watch. Through his peripheral vision, he saw Lorna's silhouette reaching for a towel.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMGI0ZGQ2NGZkZjQzODQ4Y2Y3Y2QxYjgxNTQ5MTUz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Morning," she called out, her tone suggesting she knew exactly how long he'd been awake. "Sleep well?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NjhjMmY5ODc0MjRmMjNhY2IzNmRjMzk2Mjc0MzAx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yeah. You?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMTQ2NDk0MWExMTQwNDVhMTY0NDA0ZjEyOGEwNWY0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"No nightmares, if that's what you're asking." The partition slid open and Lorna emerged, already dressed in fresh tactical pants and a deep blue thermal turtleneck. Her blonde hair hung damp around her shoulders. "Though I heard you two tossing around."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjNlY2FkOGY5MTRhMDQ5NzEzMDQ4MWQ4YzA5Nzlm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Before Xin could respond, Håkon scampered toward his mother, chirping urgently. He opened his mandibles wide, pointed at his teeth with one tiny claw, then gestured dramatically toward the kitchen area.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZWI5M2Q5MDRlNzQyOTY4MzU5MTZhYzY2ZTkzNWZl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Someone's hungry," Lorna observed, kneeling to Håkon's level. "But what do we do first in the morning?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MmZlOGRkOTY1MjRlYjk4ZGNiMDk3ZTE0YTRiYzVh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Håkon's expression turned sour. He took several steps backward, scales now darkening to the stressed deep blue that matched Lorna's turtleneck.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDc1MDU3MjZkNDRiMzY4N2IxZmM1MWNhNGJkNTFl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Come on, boy," Xin tried, moving to the small cabinet where Lorna had stored their supplies. He pulled out a metallic case labeled 'HAKON - Oral Care' in Dr. Nikki's handwriting.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYzcwMGZjMGJlMjQ2ODI4ZTU5ZmJkNGFkZGU3MDhl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Inside was a white miniaturized sonic toothbrush, its handle sized for a Diabolisk's anatomy. The brush head glowed with a soft blue light when activated.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YTk3OGRjZjFjNjQwZTM5ZmY1YWZkZTU5MmVhOTM3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">But Håkon eyed the device with deep suspicion, backing up until his tiny tail hit the tent wall. A low, rumbling sound emerged from his throat - not quite a growl, but clear displeasure.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZGMwY2E1ZjU2YjQzYzBhYTZkNmUxODQ1NWI3NDY0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Hey," Xin said, an idea forming. He crouched down, meeting Håkon at eye level. "How about this. If you brush your teeth—scrambled eggs for breakfast. Extra fluffy."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MTlmOTJkYmUyYzQ4ZjJiZjMyYWQ5ZjU5Y2Y0Njcx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The change was instant. Håkon's scales brightened, shifting from deep blue to an excited mixture of cyan and yellow. He bounded forward, vibrating with enthusiasm, tiny feet creating rapid percussion against the floor.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZGMzODAwNjU4MTQ4YjhiODJkZjY4MmQ0ZDhkZjdi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna laughed, running a hand through her hair. "Well played, Xin."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZWU3YTYyNTgxMjRmNTliY2ZhODIyYThhNmNiYTBk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I have my moments." Xin activated the mini toothbrush. "Okay buddy, open wide?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYTE1NjFmOGQ3MDQwNDRiZjYxNDQzYTk1NzZkOGU3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Håkon complied eagerly, mandibles parting to reveal rows of small, sharp teeth. They felt slightly larger than last week, Xin noted. Growing slow, but growing nonetheless.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNjJkZDk2NWVlMDRhYWNhMGEwZThlZjc4NWEwOTgz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Good boy," Lorna murmured, one hand resting on Håkon's head for comfort.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYTI2YWE4N2QwMjQyNTE4ZGZlYzE5NjUzNmI0M2Zm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The brush's sonic waves worked differently than human models - calibrated for Radi-Mon physiology. Håkon's eyes widened at the sensation, but he held still, clearly focused on the promised reward. His tail wrapped around Xin's wrist, seemingly for reassurance.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYTFkYjdmMDQ5YTRmODA5ZTBiZjdhMTAwMjliNWNi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Doing great, buddy," Xin praised, carefully working around each developing fang. "Now…almost done."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmM2QyMDBkNWEwNTRjZmQ5MmE0NWNiZWY4M2JlMWU5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A sudden chirp from Håkon made them both freeze. But it wasn't distress - the young Diabolisk was attempting to hum along with the toothbrush's frequency, creating an oddly harmonious duet.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYzBhMmQ0ZTE3ZDRlZWFhN2I3NTMwZTUxZmE2ODQx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Is he... singing?" Xin asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMjEyZjJiNGVmZDQxZWFiOTUyMjc3NzQ3YWYxYzJi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Want to be like mamma?" Lorna's fingers traced gentle patterns on Håkon's scales. "His pitch needs work."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NWU0NGMxM2VhODQwYjY4OTQzNjc3YTRlZjk2YmRm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Thirty seconds later, Xin switched off the brush. "All done. That wasn't so bad."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MjM5ZjgyMTYwNDQ5MDRhNDNlNzFhMmYxYjNkMTdm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Håkon immediately performed a little victory dance, spinning in a circle before fixing Xin with an expectant stare.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMDZmMzBkM2ZlYTRmMGE5N2ViYTdhYmI4ZjhhZDQx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Alright. A deal's a deal." Xin stood, his knees protesting slightly from crouching. "Scrambled eggs coming right up!"</span></p>
<hr/>
<p class="cnNhOTBkNDgzMDU0MzQ5YjE5Mzk3Y2YwNDZiOTgwZDI2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><strong>09:09, March 20, 2295</strong></span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZjJhNDkxMjgxZjRmZDBhNjAwOTBjNTVmNTg1YTIx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Space Rover's kitchenette featured a Tactical Meal Preparation System - military cooker that looked like a sleek metallic box but could produce hot meals in under three minutes. Xin activated it, the device humming to life.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NGMzNWNiYTBkYjRmODI5NWM2NmFlNjI0ZTZlODRi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Space Rover TMPS ready," the system announced. "Select meal profile."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MjFhZThiNDgxOTQ3Y2U4OTQyZmViNzFjYTk1OWQ4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Custom breakfast," Xin commanded, pulling ingredients from the compact fridge. "Scrambled eggs for two adults and one child, honey ham, and—" He glanced at the pre-cooked rice, venturing with an Imperium-oriented term. "Two onigiri."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MDE1Y2NlMDYwNDQyMjQ4ZjJhZDM4MjBiYzJkOWE2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Confirmed. Two-point-five portions of Terran diner eggs, Valoran honey ham, and two Imperial Islander rice balls," the TMPS announced.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MmYyMDE3NDhlYjQ0NzRhMjZjZWRiY2ZiMTk2YTNh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Sounds good." Xin couldn't help but smile at the last phrase used. "Imperial Islander, huh?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDM3MGM5NjcyOTQzYTE5M2Q5NjlhZDU1ZThkZTM2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"As a Terra Alliance appliance, this unit is required to be precise in meal specification while maintaining cultural diversity in mind." The TMPS replied.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlY2Y5NzQ2ZGJmZjRlMWU5ZjU3MWUwNmZjYTgxYWQ5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Håkon scrambled onto the counter, positioning himself for optimal viewing. His scales had shifted to an anticipatory golden-blue, eyes tracking Xin's every movement.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYTViMDRjYzQ5YTRlNTg4ZGEyNjE0MzJlZGRhNDBh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"No touching, okay?" Xin warned gently as he cracked five eggs into the TMPS's preparation chamber. "Hot surfaces and all."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYWVkOWI5ZGE4NjRiNDE4ZjY1M2RiNmY5YmUzOWIw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Diabolisk chirped acknowledgment but leaned closer, nostrils flaring as the scent of cooking eggs began to fill the air. His tail swayed energetically, matching the TMPS's mixing cycle.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMTA4NzY1MjdjZDRjNWZiY2VlNTM2MWY5NWY3OWQ2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">From the living area, a holographic display glowed as Lorna turned on the television, tuning to the Atomic News Network. She stood with her arms crossed, still barefoot but otherwise mission-ready, watching the morning broadcast like battlefield intel.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNWQ0NTdjY2FhOTRjOGViY2M2ZDMyNmExYjJhMjg1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"—markets showing unusual stability despite the lunar incident earlier today," the anchor's voice drifted over. "Imperium representatives maintain that the disturbances were merely satellite malfunctions, though independent observers report sightings of Directorate and Sand Lotus forces, plus Radi-Mon packs under unknown mind control—heavy casualties on many sides—"</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOWI0NzliNWI5NzQ1YTY4MDIxYzA4NGQ0ZmI5Zjk1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Lunar incident," Lorna muttered, shaking her head. "That's one way to describe a faction battle."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiY2ViMWNiYTA0YzQyYjFhOTk1MmEzMjgxNWEyZjJk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The holographic display shifted to grainy satellite footage and intercepted combat recordings. Xin glanced over from his cooking to see familiar figures flashing across the screen.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzE5Zjc1YThkZjQ5MDRhNDg3Y2E2NzdlNDVlNmM5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"That's..." His throat tightened as Dilinur Altai's distinctive features appeared, her silver Psi Fan glowing crimson against the lunar surface. And there - a smaller figure with amber eyes and steel-gray combat suit. "Ume."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NzgzM2QyNDk2NzRhYjdhZDYyMGE4NDdhZjc0NGJm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna moved closer to the display, studying the footage. "Is that your android?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMyM2VlY2IzMGQ3OTQyZjc5YmU1YzgxZTFhODI2NTQ2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">More images cycled through - Imperial Bloodtroopers, a Directorate Scarab mech locked in combat. Then the feed switched to a different angle, showing a Maridian man in a damaged pilot suit clutching what could only be a Moondust shard. Azure light leaked between his fingers as he stumbled toward a Scarab mech, supported by a young woman with a sleek bob haircut and white-orange ceremonial robes.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZjQ4OWRjYzI1ZjQyMDVhNzY0OWI5OTQyYzFiODU2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"That must be Jabari," Xin said quietly, recognizing the Directorate military bearing. "The one Ume chose."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NDQ2NWU2NjU2NjQ4MDRiYzViNmE4ZGQ2NGNjNDU3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"And a Sand Lotus priestess, by her outfit," Lorna observed. "High-ranking, too."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MTM4OGI2NTllOTQwM2E4OTVjMjU0MTQ5MjBlYmM0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The footage grew more chaotic - explosions, psionic barriers flaring, bodies floating in low gravity. The news anchor's voice continued with forced calm: "—casualty reports remain unconfirmed, but sources suggest significant losses among all participating forces—Chairman Kofi of the Directorate's agreed to a press conference—"</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZmYxNWM0YTgwOTRjMDY4ZDJjYjdjOWZhY2JlZDQ3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin turned back to the cooker, hands steady despite the turmoil in his chest. The eggs needed attention. Breakfast needed finishing. These were tangible things he could control.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYjdhOGM4MjMzZjQxY2E4NDU5OTZiZTAzNTM0NjQz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You okay, Xin?" Lorna's voice came soft.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMjUxMDllMDE4MDRmY2I4Y2VkZTEyNmZjNmIxOTYy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yeah." He managed a weak smile. "Strange seeing her again. Even like this."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZjZiMjNkM2ZiNTQ4MTY5NzZmNGZiZGE4ZDM1NjBl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">On screen, Ume fired a plasma weapon at Dilinur with desperate fury, her android features twisted. Dilinur deflected with casual grace, and even through the poor video quality, Xin could see her lips moving. Whatever she was saying made Ume freeze mid-combat.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYWI1ODMwNzlhYTQzMzE4MjU5NzQ0M2IzNDI4NjYx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"She seems different from most androids," Lorna noted carefully. "Very…human expressions."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyODcwYTgyODRmODQ3ZDQ5MWEyOTkzYzJjYzMyOTg3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yeah. She's like that." Xin focused on the eggs, watching them transform in the TMPS's precise heat. "I gave her something important, but I never taught her what to do with feelings."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZTkzNTIwOTU4YjQ0MTQ5NjcyMDM2MTE3NjFlYThl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The news switched back to the anchor, the combat footage minimized to a corner window. "—Imperium sources claim the incident was a terrorist attack, while the Directorate maintains they were conducting a lawful recovery operation—"</span></p>
<p class="cnM0N2NhODY1ODRhODRlOWI5YzE5ZDhjOTM1NzI2ZWU4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The TMPS chimed, beginning cooking sequence. Infrared coils activated, flash-cooking the eggs while maintaining perfect fluffiness. Håkon watched, transfixed, as the eggs transformed from liquid to solid in seconds.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMGVjMmI2NjZjZjQzMDA4YjM1YWY4N2IzODUxYTRi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">That's when it happened.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOGEyYjdiYzBhNDQ1MjQ4M2VlMTZhOTBmMTg4M2Qw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Håkon's excitement peaked, scales brightening to an almost phosphorescent gold. He chirped - then suddenly his tiny claws glowed with warm amber light, Jǫturmál emerging from his mandibles more like a trill. "<em>Sæla!</em>"</span></p><span class="cmE2OGE4MDVhZDdjYjQ2ZmJiZjU5ZWY0NDY2ZTVjOGU3"><br/>Royal Road is the home of this novel. Visit there to read the original and support the author.<br/></span>
<p class="cnMxYjk5YjA2ZTQ1MTQ0MGE4YmMxMWNjMzUxOGJhNjJj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Before Xin could react, a pulse of energy flowed from the Diabolisk into the cooking eggs.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZWQxMDRjMmQzYzQ3MGRhYjBmMmZlYmNjOGRkNmEx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Oi, Håkon!" Xin started, then stopped.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzk0MjQyOTFkMzRkYThiNTEyOTcxOTcxNmFmZTg0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The eggs weren't burning or exploding. Instead, they seemed to be... improving? The proteins restructured before his eyes, becoming impossibly fluffy, taking on a golden sheen that had nothing to do with the yolks.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YmY3ZGMyMzcwZTQxMTE5NjI5M2IyNDllNDAxZDZk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Did you..." Xin stared at the transformed eggs. "Bless our breakfast?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMGRhYmRkNDE5NjQyMzJiYTczZmZhNzMyMWRiMzdl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Håkon looked enormously pleased with himself, scales cycling through proud golds and bronzes. He did a little wiggle dance on the counter.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMTEwYzJlOWFlYjRhZTI4ODA5YmJkYzYwZGFmYTY1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"—in other news, the Terra Alliance announced new defensive protocols for all major cities," the broadcaster continued. "Citizens in North America are advised to report any unusual animal behavior or unexplained temperature drops—"</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYTRiOGVmZTAwZjRhMWNhNmRjOTc5NmY2MmU0NjIz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Xin?" Lorna called without turning from the display. "Everything okay in there?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NmVhMWIyOTNlMzRlYzlhMzFiNGZkNTAxMTlkNDdi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I think so!" Xin used a spatula to transfer the somehow-perfected eggs to plates. They practically glowed with warmth.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NWE2OTJiYjQ2YTQ5Yjk4NWQxMGI2ZWEyMDczNTE3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"If the cooker's broken, we can call Diego."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNDZhM2M2MGIzYTQ0NzJhYTIwZDIxOTJiNzYwYzBi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The cooker's fine. Håkon cast his first…" Xin met her sapphire eyes, choosing his words. "…cooking spell?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNjcyNzQxY2ZmMDRhOTM5NTI5Y2NmMTRjMzEwNGU5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">That got her attention. Lorna padded into the kitchenette, eyebrows raised. "He what?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZTZlN2NkNzI1YzRhOWI5NGEwMGEwYWM3OTNhOWZl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Leaping down from the counter, Håkon pranced between them, trilling, clearly expecting praise.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YjZlZmZkM2U3YTRjZjBiMzgzNzMzNzFiMDcwY2E1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The eggs look..." Lorna paused, searching for words as she eyed the TMPS. "Really good, actually. Like restaurant quality."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MzhkYjVhMDNkMTRlMWRhZThlODI2M2IyNjMyNzdj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Ham preparation complete," the device announced. "Beginning onigiri assembly."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Yzk3MDlmYjJhYzRiNThiOWIyZjRhOGRkYjNiYmNh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin set the ham aside to cool while watching the machine's precision rice-shaping. "So our son can heal hearts and cook, too. Quite a resume."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZjgzYjUwZDBjMTQ2ZDE4YzI3Yzg4MjgzZTE5YzM3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Our son," Lorna repeated softly, a smile tugging at her lips. "I wonder how much they'd pay him."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NDU4MWFhMjhhNzRkNTQ4M2E4NjFjYzdhM2NhMzhm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The news switched to weather: "Unseasonable cold fronts detected across California, particularly in the Sierra Nevada region. Meteorologists remain baffled by ice formations that appear to show crystalline patterns—"</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMWY4YjY3ZjNjNTQwMmI5MTkzMTYzNWZiMzI4MDg1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna's expression tightened. "They're moving faster than expected."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMzI5OWY3YWI0YjRmNzY5MGM0MzBlNDViYzZkNjc3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Jokull?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMxODM1ZmE5NWZjMjQ1NzJhMDU4ZmY4ZDU1NGQ4NjU0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Or Fenris. Maybe both." She glanced at Håkon, who was now approaching the ham, rearing up on his hind legs and lifting his claws, attempting to 'bless' it with similar enthusiasm.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2N2QwNjE0YjA4NjQ4MDc5YTIyODQ5OTZmMTBkOGQz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Easy there, little chef. Save some magic for later." Xin patted the little Diabolisk's head gently.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MzcwODBlYWYzZjRhMDJhM2MyMmU3YTczOTE1NTZi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Håkon yielded, dropping back to all fours, making a satisfied trill.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MjcxNjczOWNhOTQ1NjFhYWZiZjhlOWU5NTgzMDU0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The TMPS completed the onigiri, each one perfectly triangular with seaweed wrapped around the base. Xin assembled three plates, though he made Håkon's portions smaller, cutting everything into baby-sized bites.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYzFkMDE4MGNjNDRiMjdhMjAxNzBkMjIwN2I2M2Rh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Table?" Lorna suggested, already moving to the small dining area.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYmQ1ZjVmZmM2MzQwZjI4NTcyZTUyMzgxZmFmOWNj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">They settled around the compact table, Håkon positioned between them on a makeshift booster seat constructed from old Alliance field manuals. The morning light caught the frost patterns on the windows.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhN2QwMmE5YjUxMTRiNjZiMThhMGM3MDZjMTVlYmEx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"—just in, we're receiving reports of communications blackouts in several rural townships," the news anchor's tone had shifted, carrying concern. "Authorities assure us these are routine maintenance issues—"</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMjJlZGVhMWJlNzRlZmFhOWE5OGFkYzNkZDM4NTk4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin lifted a forkful of the enhanced eggs, pausing as warmth spread from his mouth through his entire body. It wasn't just the taste - though that was exceptional. The food carried something more.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNjZlZmViYmVhMjQzNDFiOTcwZDcwNzRjZjM3OTM1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Buddha's mercy!" he breathed. "These are incredible."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNjA3MjY3MzVjMTQxNDZiM2M2ZWNjMjZmYTAyY2I5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna tried hers, eyes widening. "It's like...comfort food but literally?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNWYxMTVlMDI1NTRmYTc5MjhhOGQxYzBjNjAwM2Q2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Between them, Håkon trilled, scales shimmering with pride. He opened his mandibles expectantly, and Lorna obliged with a small forkful of eggs.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MDNiMGVkNTE5NzQ4ODA4ZTM0ZWE4NTI0NGFkYmUx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Here, little chef," she murmured, watching Håkon's obvious delight. "Though we should probably teach him not to enchant everything he sees."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YWVmZTU1NzkyYTQxODVhZTIwODdiNWRlOTFhMTQw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Might come in handy," Xin countered, preparing another bite for their eager Diabolisk. "Would the Alliance pay for that tech? Field rations that boost morale."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZTM3M2M5MTkxZjRkMGI5N2QxZDIxMDMxNDRlNTA3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Don't give them ideas." Lorna's tone carried an edge. "Bad enough they want him for his other abilities."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZTQ2ZGM3YzYxZjQ0NDI5YWNmNmRhZTRkYmQ4YWFh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">On the display, the weather map showed expanding blue zones across California.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOTBmMTFkODIwMjRhNjRhOGIxZGQzOGE5YWFmNDU2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Håkon chirped for more food, making what could only be described as puppy eyes. Xin nodded immediately, offering him a piece of ham.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDFiMzI2NjNhZDRhYzc5YTJiYjVlZmVkMmEwNDhk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You're spoiling him," Lorna observed, though she was already preparing an onigiri bite for Håkon. The little Radi-Mon poked the rice with curiosity before munching on it, nodding happily as he chewed.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzM2FhNGNlYWEzOTRkZjhhZDI1NWNkZmZlMDQyMDRk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Hey, you're feeding him rice, too."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZmJiYjQ4NGM0ZDRiZjVhMTIyMzI2OTJjYmI5ZWQ2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"That's different. I'm his mom."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NTRlNDU3MGM0MzQ3NTE4YWVkZDM5ZjllZjI1ZGIy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"And I'm his dad. Spoiling rights?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMxN2QwYTM2M2E1YjQzMTk5YzgwMTA2NjY4ZmU5Nzgy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Håkon seemed oblivious to the undertones, focused entirely on enjoying food. His scales had settled into a contented golden-bronze, occasionally flickering brighter when a particularly good bite arrived.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMGNiNjJjNWU4NzQ1ZjQ4MmJhNDE0MDMyODdlODk1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Moments like this are rare in our line of work," Lorna said quietly, her eyes on the news but her hand gently stroking Håkon's back.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYzE4MjYzODUyMTRmM2ViOWQ4NWJlZTY2ZjAwZDk4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Every morning could be like this," Xin suggested carefully, left hand placed on the table. "If we wanted."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MmYwZTY3N2ExNjQ2NjI4NzZhMzg1M2E2YWJlY2Ez"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She turned to look at him, something vulnerable flashing across her features, her left hand reaching out. "You really think that's possible? With what's coming?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMTg1ZTI4MGNjZjRhN2U5YjM1ZWFhYjBhNjkwYTkz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Before he could answer, Håkon moved between them. He stood on his hind legs, placing one tiny paw on each of their hands. His scales shifted to a deep, warm gold, and for just a moment, Xin could swear he felt something - not words, but emotion.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDg5M2NhMDMyYTQ4MGI4YTUxYmNiYWRmNDQyYTQy"><em><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Safety-Pack-Home.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNkMjlhNWMwN2FjNzQ1ZDViODQ5MDU1NGE5ZGYxNDll"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I think," Xin said slowly, "our son is voting yes."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MTAxZmNlNGY2MjRhY2FiYjc5ZWZhZTUzYTcxOTk3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna's laugh was soft, touched with wonder.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwY2NjOTg3M2NiNDRjZDRhZGQ3NDY5ZTk1ZDcxY2M3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin grinned, the moment precious. "Hey, Håkon, want to try blessing the coffee next?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNWQyYTA2OWFkYzRlZjc5OTkwOTcyM2U3NzA0YjM3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Diabolisk's enthusiastic chirp was answer enough, though Lorna quickly intervened.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOWFhMzExYmI2MzRmNzQ4MGEwOWI1Yjc5YjhhMTE4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Another time," she said firmly. "I'd like my caffe latte un-enchanted."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NmY5NDc0OWU1YTRjY2Q5NTBjOWYzM2RmNTE0MWVj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">They continued their meal in comfortable rhythm - feeding Håkon, sharing quiet observations, pretending the morning wasn't growing more ominous by the minute.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ODg4MGMwZTM3ZDRmZDRiNWYxNDUzOTViNjkyMzVm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The display flickered in the living area, the news anchor's voice growing more strained. Suddenly, the broadcast cut to static before being replaced by a priority transmission—Diego Rodriguez materialized in life-size clarity.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOGE2ZDNlY2U4MDQwNGFiY2FkMDZkNzVmM2Y4NGYy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">He stood in his signature ballistic business suit, the fabric's defensive weave catching emergency lighting from what looked like Stanford's Jensen H Engineering Center. His Gauss Rifle rested against a nearby console.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZjI4ZWVhYjIwZDRhNDNhMTUxMTc0ZjI2MGUzZTIy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Buenos días, though I wish it were under better circumstances." Diego's calm demeanor couldn't mask the tension in his shoulders. "We have a situation. Fenris and Jokull launched coordinated attacks at 0700. Chicago, Austin, Boston, and here in Stanford - they're hitting everywhere."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MWI1N2IyMmQyYjQyYWJiNjZiMTEzNDYzMzc0NmFh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Diego, what's your status?" Lorna swallowed her bite of rice, already shifting into operational mode.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOTE2YjAzYTk5MjQ0YTc5YTkwNTYzNmU2YjAyYThi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Stanford's holding. Campus defenses are up." He pulled up tactical displays as he spoke. "But it looks like they're tracking Moondust radiation signatures. Anyone exposed lights up like a Christmas tree on their biological radar."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZTNlNTU4NGY4OTQxN2Q4ODg1YTIzYTgxMWNiYjk5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Håkon chirped anxiously from his booster seat, scales darkening to deep blue.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMDc4ZTFiZjI2NDQxM2Q4NzZjZmMxNDdlNGE2MzM5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"That means..." Xin's breakfast suddenly felt heavy in his stomach.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YjBlMGQyNWIwMTRlNGJiY2YwZTVjZmNkZTgzNTQ3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Sí, all three of you are targets. Lorna—" Diego's expression grew serious. "Your pendant's about to become muy importante. With the Moondust activity lately - whatever went down on Osram."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMWI0NzBhMzBjMTRhOGE5OGNiOWE5Mzk5ZWYxYzhj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Imperium and the Directorate had a fight over a shard." She needed no more explanation.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YWU4YzAxNDI3MjRhMzI5ZDZkODVjMTE4ZDc1OGZi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Sí. Your shard will resonate stronger than ever. You'll need to wear it." Diego nodded solemnly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NmJmNzYwOTVmNzQ4MDU5M2ZkMGJmMzEzZjc4ZDFl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna's hand went to her throat where the pendant usually rested. "It's in my coat pocket."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NzYyMDY0OWYwMzQxYzk4Yjg5MWViMzZhOGUyMmJj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Put it on, ahora. It'll help you track the Mount Lyell fragment." Diego glanced off-screen as something exploded in the distance. "I called Stardust Command. Prepping the StarWhale. Should be overhead in forty minutes. Get to Mount Lyell before—"</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MzljMDYzN2I2OTQ1ZmU4NTlhYzFkN2UxZTViNTQx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The building shook. Through the projection, they saw Diego steady himself, rifle already in hand.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMjdiODYxODczMzQwNGVhZjgyNGNmZmU5ZmJhMDUx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Contact! Multiple Skuggrs at north barrier!" someone shouted.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNzI0YzM2ZTk1OTQ3OTk4ZDEyMzAyMTA3MWQ4YTE4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"That's my cue." Diego checked his silver rifle's charge. "Get moving. I'll ping when airborne. Cuídense!"</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDBlZjYzMWVjMjQyMmFhYWFhOTUyZDM2NzY1MDg5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The transmission cut. In its place, the emergency broadcast returned - aerial footage of Chicago burning, massive shapes moving through smoke-filled streets.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YzdlYTUzNWVkNTQ4MTNiMWZlMDhiYjc1YjIyNzhi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Pack. Now." Lorna was already moving, abandoning her half-eaten rice ball. "Xin, start the breakdown sequence. We leave in two minutes."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZGFkNGIwYTNmNTQwMWI4ZmM5ZjY5NGRkNTYxNTQw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Checking his Quantum Watch quickly, Xin's fingers flew across a panel on the wall, initiating the Space Rover's transformation protocols. "Okay. Ninety seconds for full conversion."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjZiOGVjMDNhNjRhYTM5OWEyZmEzM2RlNDkzODU0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna grabbed her beige trench coat from where Håkon had slept last night, then dug through her pocket for the pendant. The moment her fingers touched the silver chain, sapphire light erupted through the fabric. She pulled it free, the blue crystal fragment pulsing with intensity.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNGUxODYwOWQ1YzQ2NTI5MGViMWE2NzMzZjlkNTBl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin breathed. "Diego wasn't kidding."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMzBhNWVlZGVlYTRkMDZhYzQwNWU4YjBkMmYwODFj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She clasped it around her neck, the light dimming to a steady glow that nevertheless painted the tent walls blue. "It's never been this reactive before."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzJhZTgzYzg4OTQxZGI4ZmIyZjE0YWMxNTQ2MDk5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A deep rumble shook the ground. Not mechanical - organic. Predatory.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMmI0YWIyNTI5NDRjYjY4MzI5MTcxNGVhODQ3NmY0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Mamma!" Håkon leaped from his seat, scrambling to Lorna.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYTdkNWVjNGQyOTQzYTBiYWMyNjEwN2QxNTRhNTI5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Shh. It's okay." Lorna knelt down to gently scoop him up with both hands before walking towards Xin. "Help pappa work, okay?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMDM5NjFiMGJiNTQ2ZjliN2YxODgwYTc4NDZjZTBm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Conversion at sixty seconds," Xin reported, watching the tent walls begin to retract. Their breakfast lay forgotten on the table - eggs growing cold, ham untouched.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YTQ3MzgxZDk1MzQwNjY5YjRkOGJhZjhmMTAxNjY3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I need to move around for a bit. Can you?" Lorna let Håkon sit in her palms as she held him up.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OGM1YmQ2NWFmYzQxMzA4M2Y1ODhjMDliNjcyNjUw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yeah. Come on, boy." Xin complied, turning slightly to let Håkon leap from Lorna's hands to perch on his left shoulder. That Lorna was taller than him made it easy.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNTQ1ZGUzNmM0NTQ2MTc5MDU4MDY2NTJjZWU2NWMy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Through the walls, shadows moved between the trees. Too many. Too large.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTNjNzE5NTgyODRjNjFhZDA5NjU4OGIwY2UyMmY5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna drew her 10mm Magnum Váli, checking the magazine. "Show time!"</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNzJjYTgxMGVmNjRiZDQ5MmMxNTc0OGIyY2RiYmNm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Have fun!" Xin's hands worked frantically as he secured their breakfast to one side of the table, pinning it against a wall where the cooker was to prevent the food from falling onto the ground. Håkon held on to him, his tiny claws digging firmly into his clothes' fabric.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMmZlMTRjOWY0YTRiMTBhMjA0NmE1ZjRiNDVlYjE2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A Krabba burst through the tree line, its blue shell twisted with crystalline growths that somehow resonated with the light from Lorna's pendant. Behind it, more shapes emerged - Bone Fiends with claws and teeth, somehow leaving trails of ice wherever they stepped.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOTllZTAzMDVkMzQ0YTk4NDY2YjJhMDk3OTEyMjhj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"<em>Glacies Lunae Fulgur!</em>" Lorna's left hand blazed silver blue as she cast through the retracting wall. The lunar spell struck the lead Krabba, gravity crushing it into the frozen earth.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0M2ZjMWZlNTRkYTRjMDY4ZmEwNGZhMDQ1ODA4Yzg4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Forty seconds!" Xin grabbed Kuma, slinging it across his back while watching over their breakfast. He opened fire on an approaching Bone Fiend, the creature screaming as bullets hit its head just before the transforming Rover's floor retracted.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NDU2YzA5MGVhMzQ3ZGViMWJhMmY5ZmNkZDFlM2Mz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">More creatures poured from the forest. On Lorna's neck, the Pendant of Mánagrát's light drew them like moths to flame.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMWU4ZGVkY2I3ODQxNTNiZDE1MTdlMWQ4ZTg3NTBm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Come at me, fuckers!" Lorna shouted, firing the 10mm in her right hand. The rounds punched through a Bone Fiend, but two more took its place. "<em>Glacies Lunae Fulgur!</em>"</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYmU3OTRhNWM4MzQ2YzBhOWEwNWFkNWViMmMzMDA1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Another creature crumpled under intensified gravity. But they kept coming.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYjRhOTA1NWE5YTQxYmFiZGE0MzE5YmM2MGI1Y2Mz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The tent walls continued retracting, revealing the Rover's armored hull beneath. A Krabba lunged through the opening, claws extended toward their breakfast table. Its mandibles clicked as it stood near the blessed scrambled eggs.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNmRiMmE3OWIxNzRiMWI5MDdiY2E1ODg4ZDFmNDZi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"<em>Skjöld!</em>" Håkon's shrill voice rang out from Xin's shoulder, his tiny form glowing with indignant fury.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZGYzOTc3NWI2ZDQ5NGViYTI4OGY2ZjQzNzVjNGUz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A shimmer of lunar energy materialized between them and the Krabba - a barrier that sent the creature stumbling back in surprise. The spell shouldn't have been so potent, but Håkon's outrage at the threat to his precious eggs had awakened something primal.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YTBjZjU3N2UzODQ1NjlhZDNlZTc4NDMzYTk1ZGFm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Nice one, boy!" Xin raised Kuma, emerald light gathering around his left hand. "<em>Bheda Atisīmā!</em>"</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NGFlN2FhNjM1MTQyYTc4ZDhkNWEyZThiMTFjYzQ2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Verdant energy wreathed the SMG's polymer barrel, each bullet now carrying amplified destructive force. The rounds tore through the Krabba's crystalline shell like paper, creating expanding craters with each impact. Instead of golden ichor spraying everywhere, the creature simply...dissolved. Green particles danced where it had stood, then vaporized completely, leaving no trace.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZmJlYzExMzFiNzRmZTI5YmQ2NjVjZjljZjA5NjY1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Not a drop had touched their breakfast.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MmY1M2Q2YWFlNjRjZDViZWYyNGQyNzMyNjdkYzJk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Nobody touches our eggs!" Xin declared, amazed at their coordination.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZmZjZWZkMzU1NDRmNDg4NDFlM2RjMThhYTlhYzc2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Håkon chirped triumphantly, his scales shining in combat-fueled deep blue.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTA1MThjYjY4ZDQyM2JiMDY0YTkxY2RmZmEwOTJm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"These must be their scouts. Larger waves will follow..." Lorna emptied her pistol, reloading with practiced speed as she turned to Xin. "How much time left?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYWI2Mjg2MzVmNzQxNDliYWI0M2VlNGViZDA5MjVk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Fifteen! Get in!" His response was instant.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NjJiNDc5NWFjODQ0ZmQ4MzlmMTM0Njg2NjNkMGIx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The driver's door unsealed. Xin dove inside, Håkon descending from his shoulder to perch on his lap as he sat in the driver's seat. Lorna backed toward the vehicle, Váli barking. Silver blue light flashed as she alternated between bullets and spells.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlM2RmYjkyZjQzOTRlNWFhNWViYzUxYjI3NDgzMzU3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Ten seconds, Lorna!"</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZTVlMGI5YzQ0NjQ5YWE5OWZhZjU4YjMwN2Q4Mzdi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She spun, holstering her gun and sprinting for the passenger door. A Bone Fiend lunged, claws extended. Her pendant flared, and suddenly the creature recoiled as if burned.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYTdlMjA4MzFmNjRiNDBhMGQ5ZDA5ZWEwOTUzNTNl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The door sealed behind her just as claws raked the hull. The final supports retracted with pneumatic hisses. They had wheels again.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZmE5MzAzMzI4NTRkNDZiMDkxNDE1ODBjMDYzOWRk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Drive! Drive!" Lorna buckled in as Xin hit the ignition.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZWFlMjY1ODdhMTRiMDJhY2M1NmQ0ZTBkZmQ5ZWQ2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The fusion engine roared. Xin threw it in reverse, tires spinning on frost before finding traction. The pursuing Bone Fiend leaped onto the hood - Lorna's pistol shots sent it scurrying away.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OTRmZjJlMmMzMzRmZjI4NDNiNzU3NGNjZDNhZjI1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Hold on!" Xin yanked the wheel, executing a J-turn that would've made Lorna proud under different circumstances.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MTM5NDk4YzQxYzQyYzM4ZDc4OTcwMWNmOThlMGVh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">They lurched forward, scattering the Fenris and Jokull Radi-Mons. Frenzied shrieks and roars followed them, but the Rover's superior speed quickly opened distance.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZmUzMTQwZWU5YzQ1YzNiM2NlNjIxMzY1NzZiZWQz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">In the rear display, Xin watched their campsite disappear beneath writhing bodies.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNTc4ZDlkZTI2NjQyODVhN2QwZmFmZDQyMGIzNzRl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"That was..." Xin's hands trembled on the wheel. "...quite a workout."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Y2Q0NWI0MDkzNjRhODBhM2ZhYmMyMTcwY2JiNjc3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You did good." Lorna checked her gun's ammunition and the Psytum Sword in her other pocket, professional calm reasserting itself. "Both of you."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzE0NzVkOWEyZDQ1MDhhMzdlOGY1YjgzNmU2ZGE4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Håkon chirped from Xin's lap. Then, his scales slowly returned to their usual blue-bronze hues as he attempted. "Gooooo-goood-jaaawb!"</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMGQyMmNjNTY3NjQ0OGQ4MTQxYTEyNzNkMTk5MzY5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Good job?" Xin glanced down, then at Lorna. "Did he just speak English?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMmVjOGZiYmYwMjQ4YThiNzc4MGRiOGRmMTZjODBm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Eyes on the road." But she was smiling. "We'll discuss his vocabulary later."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMDgwYzExOWI4MDQ0YzRhZTZiYjZiNTAyNjc3OTRl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">They drove in silence for a minute, adrenaline slowly fading. The pendant's glow had settled to a steady pulse, less urgent but still insistent. North. Always north. Toward Mount Lyell and whatever waited there.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZGFiMTM3MTY3NjRjM2I5MjY5NjhlZjdhYWNjNzhj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You know," Xin said suddenly, "we never finished breakfast."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOGY3ZTA5YmZkNDQyYTRhOWU3YjE3YWY4OWEyNGUx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna snorted. "Really? That's your concern?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTY3NWVjYzU4OTQ4MmNiYTE2ZjY3MmU5YzYyYzYy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I'm just saying, those were perfectly good eggs. Blessed eggs." He reached behind the seat, activating the Rover's auxiliary systems.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMmE1ODNlZmQzNjRiZTZhMjQ3OTdmZGNkZGQ2OGQ5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The compact coffee maker hummed to life.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZWZhZTNlZGRhMzQ4MDZhNTdkMTA4YWVmODNlMWVk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You're making coffee? Now?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYjZhMGM3ZDkwNTQxMGRhZWJjMjE5N2MzNTE5ZGY3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Latte, yeah. Figured you could use one." He kept one hand on the wheel while queueing the order. "After all that, we deserve something normal."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMjBlOGU0ZjJkYzRkMDViYzQ2YzM0OTI2N2QwNmEx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The machine worked its magic, filling the cabin with the aroma of fresh espresso. When it finished, Xin carefully passed the cup to Lorna.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMzkzNmYyYjExMjRhYTY5NzM5OWMzMzZjYzNmNTMx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She accepted it with both hands, inhaling deeply. "This is insane. We just fled an ambush, and you're serving me beverages."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhODNkNWZkMmQ2NDQ5MTg4ZTAwYWEyYTdhNWM1MzE2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Hey. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day." He grinned, some tension finally leaving his shoulders. "Even when it's interrupted by Radi-Mon hordes."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYWNhYmM5YTIzNTRhNzJhMzZiNzM0ODg4ZTFiZDc2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Excited, Håkon stretched from Xin's lap toward the cup, mandibles clicking hopefully as he eyed the steaming beverage.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZTQ3ZGI2M2E3ODQ2YTJhMTRkNGZhZTNlYWFhMzQ3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Maybe when you're older, boy." Lorna took a sip, sighing contentedly. "Much older."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMDEwMTI1ZGQ3NjQyOTBhZGYyNmEzYWFkMGQ5ZDFh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Space Rover continued north through Yosemite's transformed landscape. Behind them, distant shrieks echoed through frozen valleys. Ahead, Mount Lyell waited with its secrets.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYzQwYzBiZDQ1ZDQyYWQ5NmMxZDEzMTc2YjEzYjg5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Fetch the ham for me?" Lorna said before taking another sip.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YmE5YjBlYTQxYzQxZDhhMDNiYjc1MjI3NjUwZGJj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yep!" Xin reached behind with his free hand, pulling out their secured breakfast plates. The ham had gone cold, the onigiri slightly stiff, but the blessed scrambled eggs still somehow retained a hint of warmth - or maybe that was imagination.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTA2NjdhNDY3NTRiOTlhNzQxMWQ2NGUwMzhjNTZm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Håkon trilled excitedly at the sight, uncurling from Xin's lap to carefully climb onto the center console. Xin placed the smallest plate within reach, and the young Diabolisk immediately began munching on his portion of eggs with satisfied chirps.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyY2ZhN2YxNDEzZTQwMTc4ZDA0MDkwY2ZmZTlkZDI3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna picked up a piece of ham with her fingers, biting into it thoughtfully. "Cold ham. Not exactly five-star dining."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZDhhZGRjZTU5NTQ5NjM4MTEwM2I1OTgxNjBmOTFk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Tastes good to me," Xin said, grabbing an onigiri one-handed while keeping his eyes on the road. The rice was definitely cold, the seaweed a bit soggy, but somehow none of that mattered. They were alive, together, and the morning sun was finally breaking through Yosemite's corrupted clouds.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDFmYjFhYzI4NzRjMTliYTI5OTA0NDE2MTFiYzZl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Next breakfast," Lorna said, watching frost patterns web across the windshield, "we eat faster."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZDUwOTdjMzNjNzRkMDI4MDc3MDBjNzgxODMyZjg0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Deal." Xin reached over to squeeze her free hand. "But I'm still having Håkon bless the eggs."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MmQ5ODIxOWNmNDQyMWZhOTA5YTMyNzUxNzU3OTU1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Their laughter pushed back the morning's shadows as they drove toward whatever next challenge awaited at the mountain's peak.</span></p>
