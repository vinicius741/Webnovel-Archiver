<p class="cnM2OWM5MmFjODc4YTQ2M2I4YzI5YjdlN2I2OWQ1YmEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">The days passed slowly but surely as Stonewing</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">made its way steadily towards Zephyr. Everyone more or less kept to themselves for the trip - Dan and Ernesto only emerged from the lab to eat and sleep; Frankie and Peter stayed in the cockpit for the most part, keeping each other company and sleeping in the chairs when they needed to; and Terrance and Parlor rarely emerged from their rooms at all. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1MWEyMDRmM2EwYzQyYWRiNjhmYmEwMjIwYjhkZDg1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance didn’t mind explaining his perspective on the third day of the trip when Maeryn asked him over dinner what exactly he did all day. “It’s nothing too special. Just meditation, stretches, and dexterity exercises.” He waggled his fingers in front of Maeryn expressively. “You know how I picked that lock back on Airspire? That kind of thing takes a very light touch, and a calm mind. Get too anxious, and your own heartbeat interferes with things. Meditation helps with that. The more I am aware of my own body, the more control I have over myself, you know?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NjdjMjZkMTgwMzRlNzZhNThiOWZiODA1ZjgzMjAw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s…” Maeryn shook her head, speechless for a moment. “That’s really admirable. How long have you been doing that?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5Zjg3YmNhY2ZkMjQzMzk4YjNlNWUyYTZhMmJiMTFl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance looked away. “About as long as I can remember,” he admitted. “You know how I said I was kinda pushed into being a rogue? I meant it. I can’t really remember a time I didn’t have a routine like this. Only thing missing is sparring, but we don’t really have the space to do that on board.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmZGE3OTJjODgwMDQ0NjFhZTdjOWZkYjA5YWE0YTFk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh.” That was… a lot sadder than Maeryn had expected. “I’m sorry.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZGI1MmM0YWUwYTRlY2M5NmY2OWIxMDU1YzBjNTRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine. I’ve made my peace with it. Besides, I like being good at what I do.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwNTVmMDU0YzI2NzQyMTVhN2QwMDg3Y2YyOWVkYTZh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It sounds kind of lonely, though,” Maeryn muttered. She jerked her head up a moment later as an idea occurred to her. “Do you maybe want to try meditating and stretching together sometime?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyYmM0NWVhYzNjZTQzZjViMGRlODVkNTA2Zjg2NTQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance blinked, clearly taken aback. “I, uh… maybe? I mean, having a partner would make some of the stretches more effective, I guess. But you do realize that you’re going to be sore for days until you get used to it?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmY2M1NmQzMWMzNDQ4YzRhYWUzOTk0ZDkzNmU4MWRi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn shrugged. “Wouldn’t be the first time I had to acclimate to new exercises. Hunter, remember?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhOTc5MTQzODYxMDQwZWM4NTMzYTVjOWJkMDkwMDYw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“True enough. Then, tomorrow after breakfast?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhYmY2NDQ3OWYyMzQ0Zjc4ZTcwNmRkNzliNTdkYjUz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sounds great.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlYjAwYjQ0MjJkNjQyOWJiYWRkNGFiMmQyNGUzMGRj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Starting on the fourth day, Maeryn found she had almost no time to be bored at all. Breakfast, followed by stretches and meditation with Terrance - and he hadn’t been kidding about being sore afterwards, her calves and glutes ached fiercely after every session</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">- then a light lunch, an hour’s practice on her guitar, a couple of hours’ study, dinner, and then checking in on everyone before collapsing in bed from mental and physical exhaustion. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2YTBiYjMzNDc5ZDRhZTNhMmQzYTgxZjU2M2Y4MDg0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn was almost glad when they finally approached Zephyr if only for a change of pace late in the afternoon on the sixth day. Her first impression: Zephyr was big. Really, really big. Bigger than Airspire by far. It seemed too large to call a city, even. Honestly, Maeryn had no idea what monstrosity of steam and magics allowed the capital to stay aloft. It was no wonder a lot of Geovans thought that the Zephyrians were responsible for the mana shortage; Maeryn herself was sorely tempted to ask Dan to see if they could measure how much magic Zephyr consumed. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5NGE5YWE1NDQ0NjQyNjdiYTcyYjJkNTY2NTMwYTg1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Was Vert even this big? Maeryn had her doubts. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDY4NjBiYTIwNTRkMjA4NWM2YjkyYWJmYzAyMjk4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Zephyr looked as though the Zephyrians had just scooped a giant chunk of the ground out of the planet, smoothed out the bottom into a vague oval shape, and made it fly. A giant palace marked the exact center of the city, surrounded by extravagantly decorated buildings. All of those inner buildings were wrapped behind a wall, and everyone on the outside was divided into dozens of districts. Enormous farms, warehouses, what had to be a school for airship professions, the airfield itself - everything was big about this place. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1NWFiN2Q0Zjg4OTRhNmViOGI5ZDk5ZWNjZjNhZGEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn was still trying to shake off her awe and intimidation when they came in for a landing. The visibly armed guards approaching Stonewing</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">alongside a pair of administrators quickly got her attention, however. One of them - a bald, heavily tanned middle-aged man with no facial hair at all - wore the same uniform Lyra had worn back on Cloudreach, so Maeryn surmised that this was the Skymaster and his assistant. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5Y2QwZTVhYjc3MDQwZDM5NDhkY2I4MzA1OGQxYjVh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your name, your airship’s name, and city of origin?” the Skymaster asked boredly. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlOTFiZmVmMDQ0MTRhYTY5ODc4YjE0MDVhOTYyM2M2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Captain Maeryn, Stonewing, and we just came from Airspire,” Maeryn replied</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MWJmY2M3OGY4ZTQ0YWE4NmYwMGJhN2I5MjgyYzQw"><span style="font-weight: 400">The assistant - a teenage boy with strawberry blond hair - quickly jotted down the information on a paper on his clipboard. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxZWI2Y2U1MjNiNzQxNWZhZDFjMDEyZmZhM2E4NmVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Reason for your visit?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjYTRhOTNmN2UyMDQwOWQ5NWEzYjliMWJjYjY3ZmQw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Escort mission for Samuel Parlor.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMxZjhkODQwNzEzNzRjMjk4OTQyM2M1NGUxNDdkYzhl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Parlor… Parlor…” the Skymaster repeated softly. “The name’s familiar. Boy, are we expecting any Parlors?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZDNhMGZhY2FmODRmNjNhNGUyZDc2OWI1OWVlNWQx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sir!” the boy squeaked, quickly flipping through his clipboard. “Yes! Yes, sir, he’s on the list!” </span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDg1OTEyZWRkOTQwZjZhOTcxNTZkZjMzYWEzODE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Very well, then.” The Skymaster waved his hand dismissively, apparently losing all interest. “The boy will get your paperwork sorted. Hurry up and get off my airfield.” He stalked off to where another airship was landing, the guards following him. Maeryn watched as another assistant - a young lady this time - hurried to meet him from the giant office at the edge of the airfield. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzMDJhOTYyNTUwZjQ0NDk4OGVmMjc5YTUzYzM1ODBk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh. Pretty busy today.” </span></p><span class="cmU3Y2Y4M2RkOTkyODRlY2JhMzI0NDlmNjRkMmM3ZTUz"><br/>If you come across this story on Amazon, be aware that it has been stolen from Royal Road. Please report it.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNmYWMwZjAwZTQ1YjRjMTZhNGQwNzFiMmZjNDc4MDU2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s always like this,” the boy admitted. “Right. Um, so, how long are you staying?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjMGEwMGMyNzY2YTQ0ODZhYWUwODFjZjhhZDJmNzMy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Three days.” Samuel Parlor’s voice came from behind Maeryn, and she almost jumped at how quiet he’d been. “With option to extend.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3MWU4MjcwOTY5ODQ1ODc5YzEyOTFlZDIwNWQwNjU4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, sir. Anything to declare?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OTA2MThiOGZjMjQzZDg4Y2M1M2Y1MDdiOGRhZjk0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing from me. Captain?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwYTNjMzZhMGYyMTQ3OWNiZDI1NDM3NDk1OGI4MWJk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn shook her head. “Nothing here either unless you’re counting alchemical materials, which won’t leave the ship.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYmRmYjI1NzM5ODQzZTlhMGRjNDcwMDk1NjI1OWNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s a no,” the boy muttered as he quickly made a couple of marks. “Permission to inspect and perform any necessary repairs?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YTI5YTI4NGZmMDQxNTBiYTkyYTg1N2Y5YmQyYThi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Denied!” Frankie chimed in loudly from inside Stonewing. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiNDA3NGIwN2Y4YTQwNjQ4ZWY2Njc2YWNhZTA3ZGYz"><span style="font-weight: 400">The boy blinked, then looked at Maeryn. “Um, Captain?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NzYzN2IzYWRiNDRjYmViN2I0ZDFiOTQxNThmZmY5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s my primary engineer. I better listen to her. So, no.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0MGQ4MzY4Y2NhYzRmYTU4N2M4MjIyZmVmYzg3Nzc3"><span style="font-weight: 400">The boy chuckled. “Yeah, better not to anger the person who makes your airship run.” He finished making a few more marks, then nodded briskly. “That should be it. Enjoy your stay! I gotta go turn this in and get ready for the next one.” He dashed off without giving them a chance to say anything more. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0YWM2MjY3MzkyZTQwM2U4NTNiYmMzOWU5NDRlNmQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Parlor nodded briskly and began striding away, leaving Maeryn and her crew to hurry after him. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkOTkzMjgwYjliMTQxZTc4NzA1YWQ4Njc3MTI0MmVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">The nobleman moved through the streets like he’d grown up on Zephyr, walking quickly and confidently until they reached a massive building with giant letters declaring it </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Varia Hotel &amp; Suites</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. “This’ll do,” Parlor said matter-of-factly, opening the door. Then he paused and looked back at the crew. “Wait here. There’s no point bringing everyone inside if they don’t have room.” And then he vanished into the building. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3YjgxZWY4MWQ0MDRlNjI4ODZiMjEwZjkxM2ZhZTlm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“A place like this can run out of room?” Dan muttered disbelievingly. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1YjE0NmQ4ZWVmYzQzMGM5ZTZkNTM4NTNmYTlmYzVj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance snorted. “Of course it can. If the rooms are big enough. This is obviously a hotel meant for the rich and famous.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiMzUyMWJkODI4ZDQ4MTRhNzFmNjA2ZDdlNjVkYTYy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are we really going to stay here?” Ernesto asked in wonder. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2Yzk5Yzk3YjZiMTQxYTZiOWJiOGEwN2JlNTcwYTgy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe. We need to wait and see, I suppose,” Maeryn answered, effectively putting a halt to the conversation. They stuck out enough as it was, and she didn’t want people overhearing them being completely out of place. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZDE0Y2I5YjIxYTQ5MmE5YTk3YTY2YzU1NDc2ZWZh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Parlor reemerged from the building several minutes later, holding three keys with tags on them. He handed them over to Maeryn promptly. “There are three rooms, each with two beds and basic amenities. I don’t care how you divide them amongst yourselves. Breakfast is free, and you can order whatever you like from room service for lunch and dinner. If I need you for whatever reason, I’ll get a message to the front desk, so you should check in regularly. Any questions?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYmRlYjJhMDUyNzRkYzhhM2FjYWNjZjA3N2MyYWQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn blinked, but shook her head. “No, I think that covers everything.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMxYWNmOThkN2FjYjQ3OGM4YzhlNGI4MDA5OTBlZDE3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Very good. Then I’ll see you when my business is complete.” Parlor nodded at Maeryn respectfully, then turned on his heel and strode away, leaving them behind. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlNmNjNWUwYWE5MzRkNmFhNGVhNmVjZGJjN2RkZTY1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“... Wait. He’s not staying here?” Frankie asked disbelievingly. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzZmE5YmQzMGYyNzQwNWNhMWM0NjZkNmU3N2Y4YzYx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course not.” Terrance sighed, clearly done with the day just from the sound of his voice. “It’s the basics of noble appearances; you don’t stay at the same place as the help. He’ll be finding an even fancier place further in.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3Y2Y4YjgxZGQwMzQ2YzQ5MzhhOWJlZDNmOGU5NTVk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So it’s just a ‘I’m better than you’ thing?” Frankie huffed in indignation. “Rude!” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyZjBlNmY0ZTNmNzRjOGJiNWY5OGM4MWM3NGU2ZjZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance shook his head. “There’s a lot more to it than that. Yeah, there’s some classism - okay, a lot of classism - but it’s also to keep working folks from being unduly impacted. You don’t get it, the world of nobility is cutthroat. The richer you are, the more powerful you are, the more you get targeted by people who want what you have. By keeping his distance, he’s protecting himself </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">and </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">us.” He took a deep breath and released it slowly. “It’s really, really complicated. And stupid at times. But I’m positive he wasn’t trying to insult us.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmOWI2MjIyZDJkYjRkYTJiY2E5MzAzYjQyOWYwYTRl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We can discuss it more later. Right now we’re outside and drawing attention,” Maeryn cut them off decisively. “We need to figure out how we’re dividing the rooms and go see what we’ve got. Anyone have a preference on partners?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzMDQ2ODg4NGMwMjQ0ZjRiZmY5MWI0ODVlNDYyNWUw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ernesto’s with me,” Dan immediately answered. Ernesto’s little nod of acceptance made it simple, and Maeryn passed them one of the keys. They immediately walked inside, disappearing from view.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMjUzMTgxYmM2ZjQ4NDc4MjU1NWM2MmYxNGU1YzM3"><span style="font-weight: 400">When no one else volunteered, Maeryn raised an eyebrow and glanced around. Terrance was watching Frankie, his lips twitching as he barely bothered to restrain his amusement. Peter was also looking to her for guidance. Frankie herself looked rather on the spot, glancing between Peter and Maeryn. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2M2U2Y2JmMDdjODRhNDU4YzEwZWIzZTlmYTQyODIy"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was then that the hunter understood: Frankie had to decide whether to partner with her boyfriend - even if they hadn’t become an official couple yet - or play it safe with Maeryn and leave Peter to Terrance’s debatable mercy. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzZDM4MzI2NTIzMzRhZTc4N2NmMGRiZDI0MGZhMjA4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn repressed a smile, and decided to save her friend this time. “We’ll split by girls and boys to make it easy. Frankie, you’re with me. Terrance, you’re with Peter.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5MmI4OGYxYTFiZTQzNmViZDNiZTgyNGIwNGM5YTkx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Works for me.” Terrance idly snagged one of the keys from Maeryn’s hands. “Come on, lover boy.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyZThhZjA0NjZkMTQ3MWY4NTM5YzFkMjE5NmUwMmNk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-what?!” Peter’s face flushed bright red even as he followed Terrance inside. “I’m not…!” </span></p>
<p class="cnNkM2ViZmVjNTAyNDQzOGY5ZjVhMzg4OTFhNTIxZmE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Frankie also pinked, and glared slightly at Maeryn. “You know how I said that he might be a good friend to you? I take it all back. He’s awful.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZmYzYjNkMDMzMjQ0MjI4ZTVjYTk2ZmYzMjg4YTY5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn chuckled. “Come on, Frankie. Let’s go check out our room.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhZGU0NDI1NTNiYTRkNTA5ZmE5Y2JjYmJlOGM2OGI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">The engineer followed her inside, still grumbling under her breath. Maeryn inhaled sharply upon entering - the place looked </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">lavish</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. A beautifully sculpted spiral staircase wide enough for eight people to ascend at a time, a floor that was so clean that it reflected the lights that decorated the walls, a dining hall larger than Stonewing itself… even the receptionists were dressed in clothes more fine than any Maeryn actually owned. Everything about the place screamed “high class”, and she abruptly felt distinctly out of place. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3YzJmNjhlMjc3OTQ4OGFiOWUwMzBmNzdiNTc0M2Rj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Which, she guessed, was the point. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwOTlmN2VhMzYxMDRmYjZiM2VlMzk2ZTJiNjJjMzg0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn spotted Terrance and Peter heading up the stairs, and headed that way as well, glancing at the tag on her key. “Room 401.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZmU2ZDBlNzVkNjQ1YzU5MmE3N2Q2Mzc2OGNkMWJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s more than four hundred rooms here?” Frankie breathed. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1ODY0NjVjNzJmZjQ1Y2JiZGUyYTAwMzViNzlkOGFm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe? But if I were a betting girl, I’d say that the first number means what floor you’re on. Let’s go.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwYTY2ODYzYjZmODQ5ZmJiMjEzZGUyODRmZWQxZWZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn’s supposition paid off - they were indeed on the fourth floor, at the end of the hallway. The room itself was significantly less grand than the rest of the hotel, but there were only so many ways one could upscale a room with two large beds, a fancy dresser and closet, and a sparklingly clean bathroom. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxZTVkNjNhYTAwMzRhMmM4MjVlZTg3MWVkNzc4OWE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Frankie looked hesitant to even sit on her bed. “I… think I should probably shower before I touch anything,” she muttered. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDk1NWFmMDZhNzQzMjA5ZDNmNTA4Y2U1ZTk2ZGE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not a bad idea,” Maeryn admitted. “Afterwards, we can figure out what we’re doing while we wait for Parlor to finish with his business deal.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5YjkyZTE1MzM5NDRlMGVhNzM2MzhlMWVmYjg3MjA0"><span style="font-weight: 400">They’d only be on Zephyr for three days, if everything went well. That wasn’t enough time to explore everything, but there was one place that Maeryn was dead set on visiting: the airship academy. </span></p>
