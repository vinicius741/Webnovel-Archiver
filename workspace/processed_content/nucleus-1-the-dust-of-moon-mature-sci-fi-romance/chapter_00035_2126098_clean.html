   </span>
   eeping sounds and the smell of antiseptics woke Lorna Weiss up. Her eyes opened to a dim hospital room in morning light. Tubes ran from her arm to an IV stand beside her bed. She tried to sit up but got dizzy and fell back onto the pillow.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Nearby, Zhi-Xin Wu sat in a steel chair. His fingers typed on his Quantum Watch, green light glowing on his face.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Through her blurry vision, Lorna could see text floating above the watch, reflected in a small mirror behind Xin:
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   'Fenris strain cure'
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   'How to heal thermal blade cuts'
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   'Racial/ethnic differences in body language &amp; eating habits: Valoran, Nordling, Djinno, Imperial, Novian'
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   'Valoran female / Imperial male dating: Hurdles to overcome'
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The last searches made her chuckle softly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin noticed, his eyes widened and he quickly turned off his watch.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Lorna…you're awake," he stammered as he stood up. His hand reached out to touch hers, hesitated, then gently took her fingers. "How do you feel? Are you okay?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She noticed how different they looked. She wore a plain white hospital gown with her blonde hair loose, while Xin looked neat in his dark green hoodie and black pants.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna licked her dry lips. "Water," she croaked.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Of course," Xin got up smoothly. He went to a panel beside her bed and pressed some buttons. The panel produced a glass of water.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I would add lemon juice, but maybe next time?" he said as he handed her the glass.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Hmph," Sitting up, she took the glass with a nod, her fingers briefly touching his. She drank the cool water.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As she drank, she watched him, noticing his clenched jaw and how his eyes lingered on her before looking away.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Thanks," she said, putting the glass down and looking around the room. "How long was I out?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Well, let's see," Xin leaned back, tapping his leg. "You've missed exactly two sunrises, one rainy morning, one full moon, and an entire season of 'Galactic Gladiators' reruns." He grinned and showed her his green watch. "But don't worry, I recorded the highlights for you."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She smiled, despite feeling tired. "So, four days then?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yeah," he nodded. "And in those four days, Diego has given me the promised compensation — plus a few things to upgrade my gear and build a small project."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What kind of project?" she asked.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The kind that'll help with the upcoming mission," he tilted his head.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "So they let you become one of us without asking me first, huh?" she joked, careful not to move too much with the IV in her wrist.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Wouldn't want to put too much pressure on you, am I right?" Xin said, relaxing in his chair.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You saying I missed all the fun?" She replied, half-joking.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Define 'fun'," Xin smiled.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Anything that doesn't involve being hooked to machines," Lorna shot back.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Then by that definition," he said, looking into her eyes, "you haven't missed a thing."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Right." She could still feel her dream, making the hospital room seem unreal. She found herself studying Xin's face - so different from the Nordic features from her homeland. His olive skin, dark eyes, and slight accent in his careful English.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You seem lost in thought," Xin said.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Just...remembering things," Lorna replied, touching the scar on her left cheek. "How old are you, Xin?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I'll be 41 this October." He sat up straighter. "Why?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "My 29th birthday is coming up soon, but sometimes I feel..." she paused. "Sometimes I feel ancient. Like I've lived several lives already."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Well, life's a rough journey. It's okay to feel exhausted sometimes," Xin said.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Is my face okay, Xin? Does it look...you know," Lorna looked down and touched her cheek. Her fingers felt the rough texture of a thin scar from the knife wound, memories of torture from Iron Roach and Kaori still fresh.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Well, you're still the most beautiful woman I've ever known," Xin said casually, but sounding concerned.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna felt exposed but not uncomfortable. She lifted her head, her hand still covering the scar. "It's alright, Xin. Tell me the truth."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Well, it…it's a thermal blade cut, right? The doctor said it'll take about a week to heal. Said you should take three Medi-Vap doses each day," Xin pressed his lips together.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Typical combat injury, then," Lorna relaxed and moved her hand.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Still…" Xin's voice grew angry as he looked at her scar. "If I ever come across whoever did this to you, I'll make them pay."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna half-smiled and looked down, feeling her cheek strain. But Xin's anger made her feel better somehow.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The quiet was broken by loud chimes from Lorna's bedside table. Xin pressed the blue panel.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A hologram appeared — Doctor Nikki Chakraborty, with sharp eyes behind sleek glasses. Her dark hair was neatly braided over her shoulder, matching her older face and blue-white medical robes.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Lorna. How are you feeling? Need more time?" Nikki asked professionally but with some sympathy.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna shifted, looking slightly defiant. "I'm okay. It was just another mission," she replied.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Good. Mr. Wu, if you could give us a moment?" Nikki looked at Xin.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin hesitated, fidgeting with his hands.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It's alright, Doc," Lorna traced her fingers on the bed sheet. "Xin can stay."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Nikki's eyes narrowed slightly. She paused before speaking. "Very well. Be advised, Mr. Wu, this conversation remains confidential. I trust you know what that means?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I do, Doctor. Thank you," Xin sat back down as Nikki's hologram disappeared.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The door opened with a hiss. Nikki walked in and stood on the other side of Lorna's bed. The IV tubes disconnected from Lorna's arm with a click.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Alright, let's cut to the chase," Nikki said evenly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Okay." Lorna held the edge of her bed. Her blue eyes locked onto Nikki's, looking for hope.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Combat-induced injuries aside," Nikki spoke clinically but not unkindly, "you've been infected with the Nucleus Virus. The Fenris variant, stage one."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna gripped the bedsheet tighter. "Am I turning? Into a Radi-Mon?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "No. We caught it within the 72-hour window. You'll remain human." Nikki glanced briefly at Xin before looking back at Lorna. "However, the Virus is permanent. Transmissible through any exchange of bodily fluids or Aether."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna closed her eyes, smiling bitterly. "So that's it then. No more...connections. Not without risking someone else's life."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "There are precautions," Nikki said, "but given your work and the Virus's ability to transfer through Aether exchange, complete abstinence would be safest. Your aging process will halt, which some consider a benefit, but you might need medication for the psychological effects later."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Psychological effects?" Xin asked, shifting in his seat.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Disrupted sleep patterns. Night terrors. Possible personality changes if left untreated." Nikki disconnected the IV stand. "The medical fees have been deducted from your salary."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What?" Lorna's eyes opened wide. "I caught this virus for fighting—"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "An engagement that Diego firmly advised against," Nikki interrupted, though not harshly. "I'll inform Director Otis of your recovery. Two days until you're cleared for duty."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   After Nikki left, silence filled the room. Lorna stared at her hands, wondering how much more she'd have to give up for this job.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Hey, it's not — insurmountable," Xin said quietly. "There are ways."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "To what?" Lorna laughed without humor. "To pretend everything's normal? That I'm not poison to anyone I touch?" She looked into his concerned eyes. "This job...physical intimacy was my escape. The one place I could just be...human. And now even that's gone."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin spoke carefully. "I understand. With the androids, it was similar. A space where control didn't matter. Where consequences didn't exist."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna stared at him. "Androids? You're comparing my situation to...using sex bots?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That's not what I—" Xin started, then stopped, pushing his glasses up. "There was someone I had. An android named Ume."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Had?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "She's…with the Directorate now." His face darkened. "But before her, I tried the "pay to win" route. Leased Lily contracts. Three of them, actually."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Three." Lorna repeated, understanding dawning.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Surprising, I imagine," Xin said, his posture shifting slightly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "No. I know what that's like." Lorna sighed. "What happened?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I kept breaking the cardinal rule," Xin smiled self-mockingly. "Got emotionally attached. Made things awkward. The first one, Annette, requested early termination after I wrote her a love letter. Similar cases for Ying and Megumi…" He shook his head. "Anyway, that's why I switched to androids. At least with them, the boundaries are clear. Or they were."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Until this Ume," Lorna finished. She looked at him with new interest, seeing beyond the careful exterior of the Imperial programmer.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yeah." Xin met her gaze. "So I'd like to think I understand needing an escape, needing to feel human. Not exactly the same way, but...you know?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The confession hung between them, more intimate than expected.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The door opened with a hiss.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Diego walked in, interrupting them, his confident stride a welcome break in the tension.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "¡Oye! Look who's finally awake," Diego grinned as he approached Lorna's bed. He carried a small tablet that flickered with data. "Ready to raise hell again, hermana?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Almost," Lorna replied with a faint smile. "Just need to get out of this damn bed."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Diego nodded, then turned to Xin. "Got some news for you, amigo. We found that green beauty of yours." He tapped his tablet, showing a 3D image of Xin's car — or what was left of it. The vehicle was a mangled mess of twisted metal and broken glass, barely recognizable from the sleek car that had crashed through Terminal 5 to rescue Lorna.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin's eyes widened behind his glasses, sounding relieved and surprised. "You found it. How?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I have connections in places where official Alliance channels don't reach." Diego winked.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What's left of it, anyway," Lorna said dryly, looking at the hologram.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Hey, ramming it through a starport wall then into a cybernetic Golden Serpent wasn't in the user manual," Diego laughed. "But it's salvageable. Fusion core is intact. Got it moved to a secure garage in Stardust Command."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin leaned forward to examine the damage. "And the dashboard is alright? The custom modifications I made?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Memory banks are recoverable. The rest..." Diego made a so-so gesture. "It'll take time, ese. Couple months, maybe more. Parts for these models aren't easy to find. And restoration won't be cheap."
  </span>
 </p>
 <span>
  <br/>
  Stolen from Royal Road, this story should be reported if encountered on Amazon.
  <br/>
 </span>
 <p>
  <span>
   "SIMU has funds for this kind of thing, right?" Lorna said suddenly, surprising both men. She shrugged, wincing slightly. "Why not talk to Director Otis?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Diego's eyebrows rose, a knowing smile on his lips as he looked between them. "Well, mira esto. You're onto something."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Xin's colleagues," Lorna said flatly, though she blushed slightly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Of course. I'll talk to the Director." Diego tucked the tablet under his arm and headed for the door. "Oh, and — the Atomic Summit's pretty heated today. Alliance and Imperium delegates nearly came to blows. Might want to check the news?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   With that hint, Diego left, leaving Lorna and Xin alone again.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Might as well see what the fuss is about," Lorna sighed, looking at the television on the wall. "Remote?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin found the remote on the side table and handed it to her, their fingers touching briefly. The contact sent an unexpected jolt through Lorna, making her pause before taking it with a mumbled thanks. She pressed the power button, and the screen came on.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Atomic News Network logo appeared before showing a split screen. Lorna's eyebrows rose as she saw Diego on one side, looking formal in a crisp navy suit with the Alliance insignia on his lapel. On the other side was a Djinno woman with a heart-shaped face, full lips, and dark brown eyes. She had a bindi on her forehead, her black hair decorated with gold ornaments, and wore the red and gold robes of an Imperium official.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "—is nothing short of an invasion of sovereign territory," the woman was saying, her voice melodic yet authoritative like most high-ranking Imperium diplomats. "The Terra Alliance's unauthorized incursion into Taipei shows a flagrant disregard for international law."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Secretary Shazmeen," Diego countered, leaning forward with unusual intensity, "the Imperium's failure to uphold its obligations under the Svalbard Concordat forced our hand. Your government was entrusted with containing Primarch Skarn. Instead, evidence suggests you've been weaponizing this dangerous Radi-Mon for military applications."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "No wonder!" Xin exclaimed, chuckling.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Diego doubles as media spokesperson when asked to, yeah," Lorna muttered with a grin, shifting higher against the pillows. "I think that's his favorite part of the job. See how his Novian accent is gone? If the screen was off, I'd have thought it was a local Valoran speaking."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Shazmeen looked indignant, though Lorna could tell it was fake. "These accusations are baseless propaganda designed to justify illegal Alliance operations on Imperium soil. We categorically reject—"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Is that why multiple witnesses reported seeing Skarn fitted with Imperium cybernetic enhancements?" Diego interrupted, his casual manner replaced by diplomatic firmness. "Technology that bears the unmistakable signature of your military research division?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Shazmeen's eyes narrowed. "Your 'witnesses' are nothing more than paid provocateurs spreading misinformation. The Imperium demands immediate sanctions against the Alliance for this unprovoked aggression!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "So that's what Diego meant about the Summit heating up," Xin said, watching excitedly. "He's calling them out on what they did to Skarn, what they did to us."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "They're both doing their jobs." Lorna watched the screen, noting the confidence in Diego's posture and the calculated anger in Shazmeen's gestures. It was all theater, she knew—a political performance with real consequences. "Just doing their jobs," she repeated.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You don't sound excited," Xin turned to Lorna with intensity. "The Imperium would use the Moondust Crystal to control everyone if they could. We're on the right side of this."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna studied him, noting the flush on his cheeks and the earnest set of his jaw.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I wish I could be excited like you about these things. You feel...younger, almost naive. I envy that." She shifted against her pillows, touching the scar on her cheek.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Hey, I'm a lucky Imperial, getting to live outside the iron curtain, right?" Xin scratched his head with a self-deprecating smile. "Luck. A sign that the gods have deemed our paths righteous and given us aid."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I don't know if gods exist at all." She sighed, looking away, memories of her last days in Scandinavia flashing in her mind. "If they do, it's like they enjoy watching us suffer."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Gods or not, the Alliance and the Valorans' positive attitude is much more inspiring than…I don't know…the whole 'Obey your superiors and elders' that we'd teach back home." Xin held up a hand. "But I get it. It's okay to feel down on some days."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna felt her heart ache at his comment. If only he knew she was no Valoran. If only she could tell him. But would he even understand? The weight of her heritage?
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I chose the Alliance because it made the most sense at the time," she said finally, matter-of-factly. "Not because I believe they're the good guys."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin's expression faltered slightly. "Chose? They? I thought you were born here?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Avoiding the questions, Lorna pointed at the screen, where Diego and Secretary Varma were exchanging veiled accusations. "You think the Alliance officials wouldn't use the Crystal if they got their hands on it? Every faction wants power."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin was quiet for a moment. Then he moved from his chair to sit carefully on the edge of her bed.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Maybe," he admitted quietly. "But isn't it worth fighting for the lesser evil? For a chance to make things better, even if it's not perfect?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna turned to face him, suddenly aware of how close they were. His earnest expression and furrowed brow made her want to both pull him closer and push him away. Her fingers twisted in the hospital sheets.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Maybe," she echoed, her blue eyes dropping briefly to his lips before darting away. "Or maybe I'm just tired of fighting other people's wars."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin leaned back slightly, giving her space, but kept his eyes on hers. "What would you fight for, if you could choose?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The question hung between them. Lorna opened her mouth to respond. "There's someone I've been wanting to find. My — " Her voice caught on the word she hadn't spoken in years.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The door opened with a hiss, interrupting her. Thomas and Emmanuel stood in the doorway, each carrying brown paper bags that smelled of greasy, delicious fast food. Thomas's cybernetic arms whirred as they reflected the light, his silver eyes taking in the scene knowingly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Hope we're not interrupting anything?" Thomas asked, his metallic hand against the doorframe.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Because we can come back later if you two need a moment," Emmanuel added with a grin, holding up his paper bag and shaking it. "Or we could share these burgers and shakes from Wendell's. Your call."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Well, don't just stand there teasing us with those bags," Lorna called out with a smile.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Thomas and Emmanuel exchanged looks before entering and sharing the food.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The TV still showed the Atomic Accord Summit. A dignified Maridian man stood at the podium, his bald head shining under the lights. The caption read 'Chairman Kofi Mensah, Emerald Directorate.'
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Regarding the allegations concerning android unit U6-M9," a reporter asked, "how does the Directorate respond to claims of unauthorized acquisition?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Chairman Mensah answered calmly, his hands on the podium. "I'm not certain that designation refers to any android I personally know, but the Directorate maintains diplomatic channels with all nations across the Inner Sol."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "And the reported confrontation in NIPU territory?" Another reporter pressed.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The current climate of interplanetary relations is complex." Mensah's slight smile never wavered. "Just last week, we discussed territorial disputes with the Alliance on Jupiter's moons. The week before, concerns about the Imperium's dominance on Mars. Perhaps we should focus on these broader matters?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna noticed Xin's fingers tighten on his chair's armrest, though his face remained neutral.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Directorate sure knows how to play both sides," Thomas said between bites of his burger, pointing at the screen with his metal hand, "ever think about going back, Manny?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Emmanuel snorted, sitting down. "Nah, I'm good here." He passed Lorna a vanilla shake. "Besides, Celine's probably taken my old spot by now."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Could've been running your own warband by now," Thomas teased.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yeah. Could've been dead in a ditch too," Emmanuel replied. "You know how it gets out there. Especially with these Radi-Mon sightings increasing beyond the Belts."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna rubbed her temple, trying to stop the growing pressure in her head. Thomas noticed.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "We should probably head out," he said, standing. "Got that training session at noon, Xin. Don't forget – Director's orders."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin nodded, checking his watch. "The basics of marksmanship, correct?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Among other things." Thomas gathered the empty wrappers.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Emmanuel stood, stretching and turning to Lorna with a grin. "Try not to miss us too much, okay?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Just go," Lorna waved them off. "And thanks for the food."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   After they left, Lorna stared at her half-eaten burger, her stomach growling. "This isn't going to cut it, though," she muttered, pushing the wrapper away. "I feel like I could eat three more of these. At least."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "How about some additions, then?" Xin replied with confidence. He got up and walked to a nearby table to get some items.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He returned and placed several plates of food on her bedside table. Three plates were set before her: steamed rice, slices of pork in soy sauce, and stir-fried cabbage. Next to them were two small porcelain bowls.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Did you make this?" she whispered, looking confused.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yeah, we went shopping last night. I decided to buy a rice cooker near Davis Street Station and whip something up." he replied with a small smile as he passed her a bowl of rice with chopsticks. "Wanted to try the Maglev Train, too, but 'maybe next time' was all Thomas said."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yeah, that sounds like Tom." Lorna looked between the plates and Xin's face. She hesitated before admitting, "I don't know how to use chopsticks, though."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Oops! Give me a minute," he set the chopsticks down and opened a drawer in the bedside table to reveal some utensils. "Here you go," he said, handing her a spoon.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Thanks," she said, taking it with a nod.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin used another spoon to put some braised pork over her rice. The dark, glossy meat glistened with sauce, smelling of soy, star anise, and something Lorna couldn't identify.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She looked at her half-eaten burger still in wax paper, then at the steaming bowl Xin had given her. The smell was foreign - sweet yet savory, nothing like the salty Nordic food she grew up with.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What exactly is this?" she asked, poking a piece of pork with her spoon. The meat fell apart, showing tender layers stained by the sauce.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Lu rou fan," Xin answered, then corrected himself. "Sorry - braised pork rice. It's a comfort food from my hometown. My father used to make it." His fingers fidgeted with his chopsticks. "I thought...maybe you'd like to try something different."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna hesitated. The smell was strong - almost overwhelming after days of barely eating. Part of her wanted to stick with her familiar burger.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The, uh, meat is cooked in soy sauce with garlic and..." Xin continued, speaking faster with nervousness. "There's a bit of five-spice powder too, which might seem strange at first, but— "
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It's fine," Lorna interrupted, her tone softer than intended. She set aside the burger wrapper and took a small spoonful of rice and pork.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The first taste was sweeter than expected, with flavors of broth and hints of cinnamon and clove that strangely reminded her of Christmas in Bjørgvin. She chewed slowly, getting used to the unfamiliar taste.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin watched her anxiously, forgetting his own meal.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   After swallowing, Lorna took another, bigger bite. "It's different," she admitted. Then, with a surprising grin: "I like it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I'm glad." Xin's shoulders relaxed as he smiled. He picked up his own bowl and started eating with his chopsticks.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The braised pork rice was comforting with each bite. The food's smell mixed with the hospital scents, somehow making the room feel almost homey.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   They ate quietly for a few minutes.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna caught Xin looking at her, his eyes soft with empathy, and she felt something inside her relax. Vulnerability was dangerous, but with Xin, it seemed less so.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "So..." Lorna traced the rim of her bowl with her spoon. "This Ume was somebody special to you?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin's chopsticks stopped halfway to his mouth. He set them down carefully, adjusting them until they were perfectly parallel. "ZenFusion gave her to me as a 'reward.' Two years of performance metrics." His fingers tapped once on the table before stopping. "But she wasn't just that. She shouldn't be."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He stopped talking, his gaze distant. Lorna recognized that look - the same one she'd seen in her mirror after Oslo, when everything familiar had become strange.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You tried to make it real," she said softly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I gave her free will. As much as I could, anyway," His voice mixed pride and pain. "Months spent learning how android programs work. Broke through her programming, so she can make her own choices." A small smile crossed his lips. "I suppose she did."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "She chose to leave you." Lorna noticed the slight shake in his hand as he reached for his chopsticks again.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Thomas was with me when we saw her with the Directorate. A Scarab pilot named Jabari." he continued, focusing on picking up a piece of pork. "Living the life she wanted. That's what matters, right?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "And what about what you wanted?" Lorna asked before she could stop herself.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin looked at her, surprised. Then he looked away, adjusting his glasses with slightly unsteady fingers.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I wanted..." he began, then shook his head. "I wanted to prove that real connection was possible. Even for someone like me."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The confession hung between them. Lorna found herself studying how sunlight played on his olive skin, the tension in his shoulders as he waited for her response. She understood now why he'd stayed by her bedside these four days.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Would you mind telling me about what happened?" Xin asked quietly, almost hesitantly. "At the Starport?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna's spoon stopped against her bowl. Through the window, a military shuttle crossed the sky, briefly darkening the room. Her fingers went to her collarbone, tracing an invisible line. She glanced at another bedside table, relieved to see the Pendant of Mánagrát there, its blue jewel glowing faintly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Skarn," she began, then stopped. The name felt like ash in her mouth. She put down her spoon with a sharp click against the porcelain.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin waited, forgetting his own meal. He sat still - patient, focused.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I thought I could take him." A bitter smile touched her lips. "But it was my Psytum Sword against...whatever the Imperium put inside him. Nothing I did could scratch his hide." Her hand moved from her collarbone to her throat unconsciously. "He made me swallow..."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The words wouldn't come. They didn't need to. She saw understanding darken Xin's eyes, his fingers curling into a tight fist against his leg.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That's how I got infected," she finished, her voice steady despite her trembling hand. "He made sure of it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin carefully set his chopsticks across his bowl. "You survived. You got back up. That's what matters."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Is it?" The question came out sharper than intended. "Look at me now. I can't even..." She gestured at the space between them.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I see you," Xin said simply. No pity in his eyes, no retreat. Just recognition. "Someone who walked through hell and kept her soul."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Something in his presence made her chest tight. It was different from Emmanuel's protective hovering or Thomas's careful distance. Xin saw her scars and didn't flinch, didn't try to fix or fade them. Just acknowledged them and waited, letting her choose how much else to reveal.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna picked up her spoon again, focusing on the simple pleasure of warm food. Each bite helped ground her in the present, away from darker memories.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Actually," she said suddenly, her voice surprisingly light, "I should be asking what you need." She gestured at his green Quantum Watch. "The SIMU — we're like a dysfunctional family, and you're stuck with us now."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin blinked at the change in tone, chuckled, then matched it with visible relief. "Well, Thomas is teaching me the basics. Though watching recorded sessions on my watch isn't quite the same as actual practice." He lifted his arm, the watch's green light reflecting around them. "Especially with a Gauss Rifle."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Those are basically artillery pieces, perfect for tough big boys like him," Lorna snorted, some of her usual spark returning. "I'd start with something that won't dislocate your shoulder." She paused, looking at his slender frame.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yeah?" Xin joked. "I was wondering when the recoil would send my arms flying."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "A 10mm would suit you better. Good stopping power if you know how. Besides, you already have one," she said.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You think so?" his eyes lit up. His fingers tapped against his green watch.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Among other things." Lorna tilted her head, remembering his driving during their escape. "Your driving isn't bad either. Ever tried a Space Rover?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I heard ZenFusion used to make those Rovers. Before the Imperium came and made the company theirs." He adjusted his glasses. "Though after what happened to my car, maybe I should stick to hacking?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "No," Lorna said firmly, surprising them both with her forceful tone. "You have good instincts. Just need to refine them." She caught his gaze, held it. "I could teach you, if you want."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Something changed in Xin's expression, a mix of gratitude and determination. His shoulders straightened slightly. "I'd like that. What can I offer in return?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You already have," Lorna said softly, gesturing at the meal he'd prepared. Then she added with a small smirk, "Besides, we need someone who'd care to study the Moondust Crystal when we find it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Assuming it doesn't fry my Quantum Watch first," Xin replied, tapping the device with a wry smile. "Whoever took over that server added new encryption that nearly crashed my QPUs, you know?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Is that what happened back in the Amber Moon Spire?" Lorna raised an eyebrow and laughed. "No wonder that Bloodtrooper got you!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Their laughter mixed in the morning air. Through the window, Evanston's skyline glittered in the sun, catching the blue jewel of her pendant and casting a faint glow across her hospital gown. The path ahead would be full of challenges. But this time, she wasn't alone with her secrets.
