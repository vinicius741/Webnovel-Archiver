   Vertigo groaned as he watched Commander work his charm on not one but two women simultaneously, their high-pitched giggles cutting through the tavern's smoky haze. The women - one draped in silk that cost more than most people made in a month, the other wearing the practiced smile of someone who knew exactly how much her time was worth - made a show of hanging on Commander's every word.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Another," Vertigo muttered to the bartender, slamming his empty glass down harder than necessary. His head was already pounding, and the prospect of listening to Commander's conquests through the paper-thin walls of their accommodations all night wasn't improving his mood.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He had already brushed off one woman's attempt to entice him, finding her overwhelming perfume and expensive clothes offputting. Nathan, on the other hand, was having little to no luck at all, with either men or women. A burst of particularly obnoxious laughter drew Vertigo's attention back to Commander's table. The taller woman was now practically in Commander's lap, her hand disappearing beneath the table while her companion whispered something in his ear that made his eyes glitter with anticipation.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Goddamn waste of time," Vertigo muttered, knocking back the fresh drink the bartender slid his way. The alcohol burned pleasantly, momentarily distracting him from his irritation.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Hey, Vert!” One of the men from the corps dropped into the seat next to him. Vertigo's jaw tightened at the familiar nickname coming from an unfamiliar source. He couldn't remember the man's name. Ethan? Evyn? Eren? One of the pitfalls of being among the elite – everyone knew him, while to him the others were just a succession of blurred together faces. “He's at it again, eh?” The man nodded in Commander's direction. “You'd think he'd have enough of that by now.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “No shit,” Vertigo moaned, dismay at Commander's behavior overwhelming his annoyance at the unwanted company. “What's the deal? I mean, he called us here, but he sure as hell isn't doing business...”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Well,” the man said, “what little he's told us is that word is the powers that be in the next town over need fresh supplies of weapons, and he's feeling that the local underground culture is willing to part ways with a few pretties in exchange for the right price. Thing is, deals like that attract bullshit like you wouldn't believe, so...”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo’s mouth twisted in understanding. “So he wants us to run courier.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Usually how it goes,” the other man said with a shrug. He took a swig of his own drink and grimaced. “Thing is, though, that talent is starting to run low around here. Not the magic kind, th' other.” He made a crude motion at his chest to suggest a large bosom. “Some bastard is hogging all the business and roughing up the good ones to keep them to himself. Takin' more than his fair share, actually, got people disappearin' off the streets. Boss man's thinking we gotta shake the man down a little, get something out of him.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “What, scare this asshole into giving us some money?” Vertigo frowned. Common rackets like this were usually beneath Commander’s interests.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “No, no, I mean get him to stop being such a prick and actually let business flow. I know Commander don't deal in human cargo, but nobody ain't got money, we ain't getting paid.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo frowned as something occurred to him. He got up from the bar, finishing off his drink and tossing several coins down. “I'll check up with him later. I gotta take care of something first.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Yeah, I hear ya.” The man raised his glass in salute. “You take care, brother.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Mmm.” He just barely managed to hide his grimace.
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    You're not my damn brother.
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   He started to make for the door but noticed Nathan already heading his way. The smaller man moved through the crowded room with the quiet grace that made him so effective in combat but his eyes were troubled. Sticking his hands in his pockets, Vertigo narrowed his eyes and stared at the other man. “What? I'm just going out for a walk.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “I know. Vertigo, it's been hours. I'm worried about Bliss too.” Of course Nathan had picked up on his concern, probably realized Bliss hadn’t come back yet before Vertigo had.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “...Fine.” Vertigo opened the door. Another pair of eyes would be useful. “Let's go.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He could already tell that something was up. The streets outside were different from when they'd arrived earlier in the day. The usual nighttime bustle of a trading town had been replaced by furtive movements and wary glances. People walked faster, heads down, avoiding eye contact. Something had happened to spook the locals.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo scanned the area, taking note of the nervousness in the guards' postures, the way they clustered in groups rather than patrolling alone. "Something's off," he murmured to Nathan, who nodded in agreement.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He poked his head into a bar down the street and found people chattering about a fight that had happened across town - a big one, with casualties. He glanced over to Nathan. “What are you feeling?” Nathan's instincts were rarely wrong. He’d saved their lives more than once on nothing but a feeling.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Bliss is late getting back and there's a fight in town, and all these people disappearing.” His voice dropped. “I can't help but think-”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “I doubt anyone could abduct Bliss if they tried,” Vertigo cut in, though the knot in his gut tightened. He'd seen Bliss take down men twice her size with nothing but her chain and a vicious smile. But even the strongest fighters could be overwhelmed by numbers or caught off guard. “But I'm sure as hell not going to give them the opportunity. Let's go have a look.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   It became easier and easier to follow the trail. The collateral damage - broken windows, scorch marks, splatters of blood - became more pronounced as they drew closer to the site of the incident. The local guard had either not been around yet or had given up on cleanup; bodies lay where they had fallen.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo sensed movement out of the corner of his eye; a scrawny street kid with dirt-smudged cheeks, fingers deftly exploring the dead man's pockets. The boy froze when he noticed Vertigo's gaze, then scrambled backward, preparing to flee. “Hey you,” he growled. “You see what happened?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The kid's eyes widened further, his lips pressed into a tight line, and he quickly shook his head back and forth. Nathan sidled up to him, his approach gentler, and let a metallic sparkle show from between his fingers. “You sure? Are you sure you didn't see a pretty lady with short blonde hair?” Biting his lip, the kid hesitated, hunger warring with fear, then held out a grubby hand. Nathan held the coin up between two fingers. “Talk first.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Lady came this way.” His eyes darted side to side, always on the lookout for danger. “Din't look happy. Guy tried to get too friendly with her, take her like the other girls.” A tiny smile crossed his face. “She bashed his head in against the wall.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo felt a grim stab of satisfaction. That sounded like Bliss, all right. “More guys tried to get her,” the street kid continued, “she killed 'em all. Never seen nobody kill that many guys at once.” His expression darkened. “Guy stuck 'er with the sleepyjuice, they dragged her off. Give it now?” He waggled his fingers impatiently.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo and Nathan looked at each other, the same thought passing between them. Drugged. Captured. Despite her strength, they'd managed to take her. That meant organization, planning, and resources. “I'll give you two more if you can show us where they went,” Nathan said.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The boy shook his head vehemently, taking several steps back. "Nuh uh!" He pointed down a narrow street that led toward the riverfront district. "They went thaddaway, thas' Chief's territory. Not going in there, no how." He swallowed hard. "Told you what you wanna know, now gimme!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Nathan flipped the coin at him. He snatched it out of the air and fled. They both ignored him. “Chief?” Nathan asked, addressing no one in particular.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Must've been some changes since we were last through,” Vertigo said, recalling the conversation with the soldier in the tavern. Snarling softly, he pulled his weapon, gazing into the shadows down the street where the boy had pointed.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “What are you doing?” Nathan asked, although the resignation in his voice suggested he already knew the answer. “We should go back and tell Commander.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “You go back and tell Commander,” Vertigo responded through gritted teeth. “I'm going to find Bliss if I have to tear this town in half.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Nathan hesitated for a fraction of a second. “Okay go, I'll find you, then we'll find her!” He took off in the direction of the inn. Vertigo didn't doubt that he would be able to find him; Nathan seemed to have an uncanny knack for tracking either of them down.
  </span>
 </p>
 <span>
  <br/>
  Stolen from its original source, this story is not meant to be on Amazon; report any sightings.
  <br/>
 </span>
 <p>
  <span>
   He turned and sauntered down the dark street, massive sword slung casually over one shoulder. The thing was almost bigger than he was, with a broad blade that reflected the scant light most menacingly, and it was perfect for attracting the attention of some slum lord's goons. Far from attempting to be stealthy, he made himself as conspicuous as possible, knowing he was bound to be challenged sooner or later.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He was right. He hadn't been wandering very long when a couple of armed men swaggered up to him. They were dressed similarly, with a small insignia of a clenched fist at the right shoulder. They weren't city enforcement; they looked like the typical dumb and ugly grunts that any small-time tyrant might hire, with a confidence that far outstripped their skills. “We ain't seen you around before,” Ugly drawled, thumbs hooked into his belt with practiced arrogance.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “You got business here?” Dumb asked, eyeing the sword.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo let a humorless smirk stretch the corner of his mouth. “Yeah I got business. It's called making you two assholes tell me what I want to know before I spill your guts for you.” Quicker than either of them could react, his free hand snaked out and snatched Ugly by the neck, lifting him easily into the air. Ugly cursed and flailed, choking, and Dumb took a couple of steps back, his eyes wide. His surprise didn't stop him from pulling his rifle. Vertigo allowed a spark of amusement into his voice. “Really? You that good a shot?” He dangled Ugly in front of him, a human shield, watching the other man’s confidence waver. Ugly was trying desperately to reach his own rifle, but every time he tried Vertigo tapped him in the head with the butt of his sword hard enough to stun him for a second.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Chief don't like people disturbing the peace.” Dumb gestured with his rifle. His voice remained steady but sweat was beginning to bead on his forehead. “You drop him, turn around and leave right now, maybe with a little bit of cash for our trouble, and we can forget the whole thing.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo laughed, unforced and genuine. “I'm looking for a friend, gentlemen. Pretty girl, blonde hair, nice ass, bad attitude. Word is pretty girls like her've been disappearing off the streets and I have a feeling that you two dumbasses can tell me where I might find her. Maybe you should start talking before I scramble what little brains your friend here has left. Not that you'd be able to tell the difference.” He let Ugly have another love tap at the base of the skull, just for emphasis.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “We ain't seen her!” Ugly howled, still struggling in Vertigo's grip. His face was beginning to turn an alarming shade of purple. “We wasn't even on shift when she killed Rolf and his-” He realized his mistake and shut up, but it was too late.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “I'm running out of patience.” His voice was a monotone, flat and cold. “Thirty seconds.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Fuck you!” Dumb spat, and snapped his rifle up to fire.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo dropped Ugly on his ass and thrust his hand out at Dumb. The air between them rippled with sudden heat as a gout of flame shot out from his hand, roasting the man. The thug's scream was high and piercing, quickly cut off as his lungs seared in the inferno. Within seconds, there was nothing left but a charred, smoking husk.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The night was suddenly very quiet. Anyone in the surrounding buildings who had heard the commotion would know better than to look outside or interfere. This was clearly a district where people minded their own business, especially when magic was involved.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Commander would be furious that he'd revealed his abilities so blatantly. The corps operated on discretion and the element of surprise; Talents were kept in reserve whenever possible, revealed only when absolutely necessary. But right now, Vertigo couldn't bring himself to care. All that mattered was finding Bliss.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He lowered his sword at the prone form of Ugly, the flames of the thug's burning comrade casting him in red, hellish light. “Start talking.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </span>
 </p>

 <p>
  <span>
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The warehouses sat right on the river, their dark silhouettes blotting out the stars. Vertigo and Nathan eyed the guards outside from the alleyway. “I'll take the one on the left,” Nathan whispered, not moving his gaze. In the dim light, his face was all angles and shadows, the usual warmth in his expression replaced by cold calculation. “You take the right one. Then you wade through and find Bliss, I'll handle what's left, and Commander said to start freeing the other prisoners, that should cause some distraction. Backup can't be too far off now.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo nudged his arm. “You just want to let 'em go out of the kindness of your heart.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Nathan grinned. “So maybe there's multiple benefits to this plan.” He leaned his weight into Vertigo, nudging him back.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo rolled his eyes, but the knot in his chest loosened slightly. He hefted his sword. The familiar weight of the giant blade settled a sense of calm over him. “Let's do it, they're not getting any deader while we're standing here talking about it.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Without further discussion, they emerged from the alley and strode directly toward the entrance. The guards had just enough time to register surprise before Nathan's rifle barked once, cleanly dropping the man on the left, while Vertigo's blade swept through the air in a whistling arc that separated the second guard's head from his shoulders in a spray of blood. Shouts came from inside and a moment later a bell on the roof was ringing.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Looks like the party's started,” Vertigo deadpanned, kicking the door in. “More probably on their way.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “I've got this,” Nathan shouted, bracing his rifle at his shoulder. His expression was focused, almost serene, as he sighted down the barrel. “Find Bliss!”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo plunged into the hallway, scattering a small knot of guards before they had the chance to fire their weapons. Blood sprayed across the walls as he carved through them, barely slowing his forward momentum. Behind him, the precise crack of Nathan's rifle provided cover, each shot finding its mark with unerring accuracy. The inside of the building was a maze, with partitions and cages everywhere. As he progressed deeper, Vertigo began to understand the full scope of the operation. Cages lined the walls, each containing huddled figures that shrank back as he approached. Men, women, children, all with the same hollow-eyed stare.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Red-hot rage boiled in his veins. He burned the lock off the first cage he passed, swinging the door wide and gesturing impatiently to the occupants. "Go, go, go!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   They hesitated only briefly before streaming out, torn between fear of him and fear of remaining imprisoned. He moved on without waiting to see what they would do, trusting that self-preservation would guide them toward the exit.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Cage after cage failed to produce Bliss, only other women and a few men or children who either cringed away or cried for help. He spent only enough time to confirm that Bliss was not in each dimly lit prison and destroy the locks before moving onward. Shouts and the noise of fighting grew behind him as the prisoners began to arm themselves with whatever was at hand and turn on their captors. “Bliss!” Vertigo yelled, wading through a fresh wave of guards who were suddenly more interested in the flood of newly escaped captives than him. “Bliss! Is your sorry ass in here?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Glass shattered somewhere and Vertigo glanced over his shoulder to see flames spreading in a rush from a broken lantern. “Shit,” he muttered to himself, “shit shit shit.” Fire in this tinderbox would be deadly within minutes. The screaming turned panicked and he started to run. “Bliss!” he bellowed, making his way through to the back of the warehouse as fast as he could. Smoke filled the air, stinging his eyes and burning in his lungs.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She was not in the building. He burst through the back door and stood in the alleyway, breathing hard in the rank stench of sewage and worse from the river. Contemplating the possibility that she was in one of the other warehouses nearby, or that Ugly had lied to him, he growled in frustration. Shouts and curses continued from inside the building as the fire grew. The door behind him slammed open again, and a man stumbled out, coughing violently. He wore only undershorts, his chest and arms marked with fresh bruises. When he spotted Vertigo, he froze, slowly raising his hands in surrender. As recognition dawned, his expression shifted from fear to defiance.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “You do realize you've just fucked up, right?” the man growled. “You don't mess with the Chief.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “You do realize
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    you've
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   fucked up, right? You can't fuck with someone like Commander 'n get away with it.” A familiar figure dropped from the warehouse roof, landing in a graceful crouch beside him. His jaw dropped. Relief flooded through him, momentarily washing away the anger and fear that had driven him this far.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Bliss? Where the fuck have you been? We've been raising all sorts of hell trying to find you.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She straightened, brushing dust from her leather jacket with exaggerated nonchalance. Despite her casual posture, Vertigo could see the dangerous glint in her eyes, the barely contained violence in her movements. “I was havin' some beauty sleep until you guys started making all that damn noise,” she drawled, rolling her shoulders as if working out kinks. “Didn't they get a surprise when the drugs wore off and the bars just bent open.” The chain coiled at her waist unwound itself slightly, weaving back and forth at the end like an angry snake. The metal writhed through the air as if alive, responding to Bliss's will rather than the laws of physics.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “L-look, we didn't-” The man looked about ready to piss himself. His eyes were fixed on the animated chain, widening in recognition and terror.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “No, I'm sure you didn't. An' you won't, ever again. Will you.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The man shook his head frantically, only to have it violently separated from his shoulders as Bliss lashed out with her magically reinforced chain. The metal links moved faster than the eye could follow, cleaving through flesh and bone with impossible force. Blood sprayed across the alley wall in a crimson fan as the body crumpled, twitching.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Damn straight you won't.” She kicked the corpse for good measure and then turned away to face Vertigo. Her expression softened slightly, although the dangerous edge in her eyes remained. “Holy shit, did you guys send out the entire rescue squad? Well damn, I feel loved.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo grinned, the tension he'd been carrying since he realized she was missing finally unwinding. “Hey, we couldn't go losing the most valuable member of the corps, now could we? I mean, who's going to find expensive shit for Commander to sell for booze and whore money if you're not around?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Heh.” Bliss shook blood from her chain with a casual flick of her wrist, then cracked her neck loudly. The metal links retracted, coiling back around her waist like an obedient pet. “Well if any of these jackasses has a bounty on their heads he's about to have plenty more, cause I'm in the mood for some ass-kickin'. How many of these bastards are there, anyway?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Not enough for them. Nathan is back there mopping up, and reinforcements should-” The crack of a sniper rifle rang out, followed by distant shouts. “-be here any second. Commander's gonna be pissed.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Why? Because they kidnapped me?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “No,” Vertigo replied, his mouth twisting into a grim smile as he glanced back at the burning warehouse. Screams and gunshots echoed from within, punctuated by the sound of collapsing timber. “They fucked up his trade deal.”
  </span>
 </p>
