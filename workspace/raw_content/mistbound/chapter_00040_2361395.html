<p class="cnM5ZTJkZTMyOWYxMDQ5MTBhMDhhYWY0MzQ5NTRhYjcw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn’s footsteps echoed in the dark, cold, abandoned streets as she approached the Council of Winds headquarters. It was - like everything else in Zephyr - an enormous structure. But she paid it little mind, her eyes focused on the goal. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyYjEwZWRhMzQyZTQyY2FhMTIxM2I3ODYzNTc4MGNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was almost one o’clock now. Whoever had written the letter, if they were smart, would already be there waiting for her to prevent her from laying a trap, or perhaps to lay a trap of their own. Maeryn set her jaw and kept walking. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkM2I2ODg3MzUxODQ2MDhiMzdjZGVmOTA3ZTQyYTEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">She opened the door with a low creak, stepped into the darkness and closed the door behind her without a word. Then, calmly, she walked with sure footsteps into the lightless area, knowing that she would not bump into anything as she approached another door in the back of the room. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0M2NkNzRlNzdhODRiNTdhMmU3MjM3YjBhNTQ4NjMw"><span style="font-weight: 400">This door, when opened, revealed another chamber - similar to the one on Cloudreach - but there were a few observations of note. Firstly, where Cloudreach had three desks in a simple room, here there were nine desks arrayed in a semi-circle surrounding a center podium. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwMjI1ZjNjYjNlYTQ5ZWNhMmI2MDg2YzAwMTYxZTY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Secondly, and more importantly, this room was already lit, and seated at each of the desks was a hooded figure. An unconscious Terrance - unbound, but doubtlessly drugged - was set against the far wall. His chest rose and fell in a slow, rhythmic pattern, indicating he was alive, but deeply unconscious.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZmI2YTc0MDA4MTQ3NDJhNzBmZWE4NDEwYzFmYjQ4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn repressed a smile. So far, she’d seen nothing too unexpected. But it was time to play the game. She stepped up to the podium, casting her eyes at the hooded figures but seeing nothing identifying about any of them. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3MzBjNDBhZDdmNTRlMWRiZDE5MzU0MDViZjZhOWYw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Captain Maeryn d’Vert,” the one directly in front of her spoke, and Maeryn immediately set to analyzing the voice. Female, adult - late twenties, maybe? Her voice was somewhat lower-pitched, with a faint trace of an accent. A familiar one, though Maeryn couldn’t quite place it. “We are glad you could make it.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM2MmIwNjQ2YzRmOTQ1NmQ5ZDIxYTIzMTczNjQ3Yjgy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not a fan of pomp and circumstance, and my time is valuable. Cut to the chase. What do you want and why?” Maeryn demanded bluntly. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0OWQ4MDk5NWZkZTRiMTI4NTMxYWZhZTEzMjE0OWVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">The other figures shifted slightly, their cloaks rustling as they did so, but the woman in front of Maeryn did nothing of the sort. After a moment, she chuckled. “Oh, very well then.” She reached up, and without warning, flipped her hood down, revealing her face. “Hello, Maeryn. You probably don’t recognize me, but I certainly remember you.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5OWFkYWFjOWQ3YjQwMWE4NTI1ZGVmMDMwMjZhNjhi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn blinked, examining her closely. Green eyes, dark wavy hair… and something about her face tugged at her memory, but… from where? “You… do look familiar,” she admitted. “Where do I know you from?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3YzE1ZGE3YzM4MDQ4ZDM4MGY0MmMzNmU4YTVhY2U0"><span style="font-weight: 400">The woman laughed, and the sound was achingly familiar. Who was she? How did Maeryn know her? “I was the receptionist at a number for those stodgy old Elders meetings! The last time I saw you, you must’ve been around twelve years old, I think? Did you really think that you never got caught, listening in on the Elders trying to figure everything out? Your mother asked me to keep an eye on you.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzODFkNGFjNWQzYjQzNDBiYjI2MjNiN2VkMDIwNGJh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn’s eyes widened in simultaneous surprise and elation as the pieces fell into place. “You were?! Depths below, you’re right, I remember you now! It was… Gwen, wasn’t it?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM4N2E5ZTM2ZTU0MDQwYzA4YzM0MTRiZjJiMzcwZmJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yep!” Gwen cheerfully agreed. “Honestly, I’m surprised you remembered. How’ve you been?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYjY5ZWY5NDRiZTRiOTU4MWI0MmE5MDRmOThlYjdj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn groaned, opening her mouth to start telling her everything… and then she remembered where she was, and her mouth clicked shut. “As much as I’d love to catch up,” she said slowly, guardedly, “and as much as your being here answers </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">how </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">you knew my full name, I think we have more important things to talk about. Don’t you?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM4NWJhYTZiNDM5YjRkMjFhMThlNTNkMzE1ZWY2ZjY5"><span style="font-weight: 400">The smile on Gwen’s face faltered, and Maeryn thought she saw a flicker of regret flash in her expression before she regained composure. “I suppose we do,” she agreed softly. “Alright. Straight to the point, I guess.” She gestured at her hooded companions. “The underground Geovan terrorist cell? That’s us. We’re all Geovans, just like you. Each of us lost faith in the Elders for one reason or another, and each of us made our way here to Zephyr. Some to plead our case and beg for help from the Zephyrian government…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZDFlMzFjMTYwMDRlY2NhMWRlNWM3OWM3NDA0YjJk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Three of the figures on Maeryn’s right lowered their hoods. The first was a scarred old man with long, straight white hair and a beard that reached his chest. The second, another vaguely familiar middle-aged man that Maeryn abruptly remembered was a former hunter colleague who had retired shortly after she joined. The third was a young woman, barely older than Maeryn herself, who couldn’t meet her gaze. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1NzNiMTFmZDJiYjRlNDFhMjk5OTg0OTI1MjgwMjdl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Others to investigate the claims that Zephyrian air-cities were the reason for the mana depletion…” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhMmFjNDhiYjg1ZDQ1ZjFhMWU5YWYwZDJkNDc2MTRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Two figures on Maeryn’s left unveiled themselves then, showing a man and a woman, both looking to be perhaps in their mid-thirties, each looking rather plain and nondescript. They nodded at Maeryn, and held up a couple of devices that Maeryn vaguely recognized as outdated Geovan mana measuring instruments. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjZDQ0Yzc3ODgwNzRjNjFiZTQ4OGU5ZTIxMWExMjc4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And others still looking for ways to bribe, blackmail, threaten, or otherwise coerce the people in charge to do something, anything that might give our people more time to figure out the Mist.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwZWFkNjk0YTRkZDRiY2Y5MDFjMGNlNzliYWFmZmI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">The final two figures on Maeryn’s left removed their hoods, showing a pair of bald identical twin brothers. Their faces were hard and gave no expression at all as they looked at Maeryn calculatingly. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2MTY1MDlhMjU3MzQxZDg5MTVmODAzMDlhYjFlZWZh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And finally… others who were willing to do anything, no matter how heinous, if it meant giving more time to their families at home.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM1YjlmZmEyODM0ZDQ4NWZhYWIyODAzYThmYWJkZDNm"><span style="font-weight: 400">The last member on Maeryn’s right dropped their hood, and Maeryn carefully observed the woman underneath. Her auburn hair was shoulder-length, with just a hint of wave, but Maeryn’s eyes were immediately drawn towards her face. It was sharp, angular, but it was the way she was staring right back at Maeryn that unnerved the hunter the most. It felt as though she were being dissected in the woman’s eyes, picked apart without a word or single action beyond her stare. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmNWUwOTA4ZGE2MTQ5NmRiNDA5M2RhZDc0MWI2NTVm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We found you in the airfield logs,” Gwen admitted. “I recognized the name, and your airship name - Stonewing - left me with little doubt it was you. We’ve had someone following you all day today, and they overheard your conversation with Terrance. Imagine our surprise when we learned that you’d made actual progress against the Mist with you and your ragtag team. And that you’re consorting with a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">necromancer</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> of all things.” She shook her head. “I never would have expected it of you. Or of any Geovan. But perhaps that’s why you’re making progress.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlNDcyYmQwYWVjOTRlNWNhN2RlYjZjMzRiNjUwZTVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn grit her teeth. “Gwen. I like you, I remember you fondly, but by the Hearth get to the point, please. I get it, you have a good spy.” She looked pointedly at the angular-faced woman, who didn’t react in the slightest. “And I’m willing to share what I know, but just tell me what you want already.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0MjI0NjI5YWIxZjQ0YjQ5MGJlMzZlMjhjYTk4NjNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Gwen grimaced. “Right. The point.” She took a deep breath. “The point is, we want your help, and we’re willing to lend ours in exchange. We’re all in the same boat, after all. Geovans in enemy territory, trying to save our world.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YzQzMzE0YzY1NzRmZGJhYjkxOTg3MDU1NDFkYzNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We want you to lend us your necromancer,” one of the twins cut in abruptly, and everyone fell silent. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxNWU5MGMxNDdiNTQ2ODliMTVlOGEyYjYxYmZhNjhm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn swallowed. Finally, they were getting to the point. And of course they wanted Ernesto. The hypocrisy of it all, looking down on her for working with a necromancer and then asking to use him in the same breath. Sickening. “And what do you want him to do?” she asked archly. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhYTgzNGQzMDc4ZjQyNDc4MzYyYWE4ZDI0NTEyN2Ez"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What else? We want him to raise some Undead,” the other twin replied. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4N2E4OWJjYjYwNTQzYThhOWUxOWQxMTAxZDE1YTYx"><span style="font-weight: 400">The first twin made a motion as if shooing off an insect dismissively. “No need to kill anyone - it’s just a distraction.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMxYjliYzBjMzk1ODQ3NDk5NDJhYjk4NWQ5YTQ2NmFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’ve been trying to destroy the reputation of the Gaspers for months,” the old man explained calmly, seeing Maeryn’s hackles rise. “The Gaspers have been pushing hard for the Council of Winds to take more aggressive action against Geova, to claim Geovan farmlands and stock up on supplies in preparation for Critical Mana Depletion. If we can frame their heir for necromancy, that would do the job nicely.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZTA2Njk4MjY3YTRkYTU5NTI2ZWIxNzY4MzJmYjY2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn stared at him. “You do realize that you’d be condemning the Gasper heir to death, right?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzZmFjODNiZTgzZjRjZjdhZTcxZTlmYzViN2U0NGMy"><span style="font-weight: 400">The ex-hunter snorted derisively. “Not a great loss, there. The young man’s arrogant and foul, relying on his family’s money to make his problems go away. A more spoiled brat you couldn’t find.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlOWRlNTk0ZmMxMTRiZTliYjgwM2I0Y2VlOWNjY2M5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s assuming that he’s actually put to death,” Gwen pointed out archly. “He’s not actually a necromancer. But framing him will smear the Gasper’s reputation while they investigate. It buys some time.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiNjZmNGQ5ZmE2YjQ4ZTg4MmEzMmFhYzNjYjc2YjAx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Small problem. Even if I were to go along with this - and I’m not convinced yet - my necromancer doesn’t actually know how to raise the Undead,” Maeryn told them bluntly. “He’s focused exclusively on cold and acid spells.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlNDVjNmNiZDY5NjRiZWFhYTFiZjAzNDdjNmFmODY1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And you believe him?” the ex-hunter asked incredulously, his face twisting in disdain and disbelief. “And here I was taking you seriously. I didn’t expect you to be so naive.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNkMmI4MzgwYjYyYTQ4ZmJhNGQ2ZGViZTI3ZjYxNTU4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn’s eyes narrowed as she looked the middle-aged man over properly, anger bubbling in her gut. “Preparation and clear thought are the keys to survival,” she quoted the Hunter’s Motto pointedly, and the ex-hunter inhaled sharply, taking her meaning instantly and leaping to his feet. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZTYwMjljODQ1NjRkZDJhOTFlYmQ3ZDkzNTNjMzMw"><span style="font-weight: 400">But it was too late. Maeryn snapped her fingers, and the ex-hunter froze, feeling a dagger at his back. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlZjk3MGM3NzUxMzRkM2I4ZDA3ZjdhMThiNGJhNTUx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I concede,” he admitted slowly, enunciating each syllable very carefully. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3MmQzZjg0M2MxNDQzNmM4ZDE4ZjM0NDMyNDVjZmZk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn watched him for a moment, then nodded. “Let him go.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyNmM1MGY4MWJkYzQxNjFiNWMzNTQ3M2MxYTMzZDMw"><span style="font-weight: 400">The dagger was withdrawn, and the ex-hunter looked over his shoulder to see… Dan, with a dagger held at the ready in a reverse-grip. The retired hunter then looked back at Maeryn. “How in the Depths did you manage to get him in here without me knowing? We’ve been here since midnight!” </span></p>
<p class="cnM1OWFkMjI1ZmNmNTRlMGQ5NzI3MDVjMzhjZDQwMDk1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn’s smile was thin. “You should know better. Never, ever give a hunter time to prepare and trap a place. Your missive arrived at seven, and told me when and where. You may have been here since midnight, but I had Dan hiding in the corner under a Chameleon Potion since ten-thirty.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYjY1ZTRjMzA5NTQ5Yjc5YWIyZWJhYjQxZmExMWI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">The ex-hunter let out a slow breath of air. “I admit it. I was the naive one. I apologize.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlZWVlNDU1YWZlMDQyNjc4MDhhZjA3ZWQ2Mzg4ODky"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn nodded once, sharply. “Then the matter is settled.” At her words, the ex-hunter slumped in visible relief, settling back into his chair as Dan backed off. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyNTMxNzk4M2NkNzQ3ODg4ZjJjM2M4YWRlZjQ0OTE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“... What just happened?” the young woman asked quietly. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmYzdlNjMxM2M0YjRkZWNiOTRlZTFjODAyMDhkMmQx"><span style="font-weight: 400">The old man snorted. “When it comes to matters of life and death, you should expect any successful hunter to be Depths-damned sure of their equipment and their companions. Anything less is to invite death into their midst,” he lectured, with both Maeryn and the ex-hunter nodding along. “If one hunter calls another one naive, then it’s a direct challenge to their preparedness and ability to survive. It’s one of the most dire of their insults - basically calling someone too foolish to survive, and putting the people they’re supposed to protect at risk. The only way to resolve such an insult is to see who’s more prepared for an unexpected fight.” </span></p><span class="cmJjN2IwYjZhMGRlNTQ5Y2I5ODNmMTE0MzM1MjM4MzAy"><br/>This content has been unlawfully taken from Royal Road; report any instances of this story if found elsewhere.<br/></span>
<p class="cnMxNjA3YzVlY2JkMjQyNWJiN2U1YjhiYmUwYjE4YTc2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh.” The woman looked at Maeryn in surprise, then looked down again, shying away from eye contact like she had been the whole time. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjg4YjZmNzA4YzRhZmJiNWQ2MmM5M2Y0OTQ5MmE0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Gwen coughed loudly and pointedly, redirecting attention back to her. “If we can return to the plan? The one to frame the Gasper heir? If your necromancer can’t raise the Undead, then that’s that. We’ll need to come up with something else.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNGE2ZWQ2MTZlODQ0YWNhOWI4MDRlMmNmYjBhMGFh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“How long would it take him to learn?” the first twin from before interjected. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwYTEyZTg5ODI1MDQ3M2NiNmVkZWJhZWE1Y2M1MTA3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned!” Gwen cried out in exasperation, raising a palm to her face in sheer frustration. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5M2Y5YzJiNmVlYjRlMDNhZWUwZjg5MjQ0MWRiYWZk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s a fair question,” the second twin argued. “If we’re going to work with a necromancer, then by the Unending Depths we should use his talents for the good of all of us. A small, controlled encounter with the Undead would help all of us.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjZWMwNmVlODY5NTQ5YjU5YWYwNWRkNDVmOTFkYTMx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ted…! Ugh…” Gwen grumbled under her breath for a moment, then reluctantly met Maeryn’s eyes. “Maeryn… do you have any idea?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjODk3ZjJhNDAzYjRlNGI5ZDk5M2JmODcxODg5Mjc3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No,” Maeryn replied simply, staunchly refusing to voice her speculations on Ernesto’s abilities. “Find something else. My necromancer will learn how to raise the Undead when he’s good and ready, and most importantly, far away from all civilization so nobody gets hurt. His Master raised a single Undead in order to confirm the link between the Mist and the Undead, and got himself killed when he underestimated it.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYzYyYTAzYzMyMDQwYzE5NWM5MDQ5ZjkwNzQ4YjY4"><span style="font-weight: 400">The twins folded their arms in front of them in dissatisfaction. “Sounds like he’s scared,” they accused together. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4NTEyNjE5YmMwMzQyZDFhNzM3NTk4MzE3ZWQzMjI0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course he’s scared! It’s the Depths-damned Undead! Do you think that being a necromancer somehow makes you immune to that?!” The words exploded out of her mouth before she could think better of them, but she certainly didn’t regret them. Maeryn leaned forward, glaring fire at the twins and daring them to challenge her further. “He’s a human being who recently lost the only support he’s ever known, to a creature that he knows damned well that he could create if he put the effort in! So drop it before I drop </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">you</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNTRlYjE4Y2UwYTRkZTdhYzBjMzE1Y2JkMjM2NzBm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tch.” The twins clicked their tongues in sync, looking in opposite directions from each other, but said nothing more. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2N2FjYjBiZDY2YzRmYjY5OGU5N2Y0MDBjYWE5ZmFk"><span style="font-weight: 400">The plain man, the one who had been described as having come to Zephyr to investigate the air-city’s consumption of mana, coughed into his fist, catching attention. “I’m not saying that he </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">should </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">create the Undead, but… if he won’t do it, then why exactly are you even working with him? It sounds like it’s all risk, no gain otherwise.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyMmVmYmUwNzIyODQxOTk5NDY4NGM1MjQ4MjY4MjUx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn shot him a sharp look. She had agreed to share information, and it was a reasonable question, so she reluctantly decided to answer. “Because it’s necessary,” she said simply. “The Mist is generated by the Undead. Our current plan is to purify the Mana using inverted necromantic mana… which requires a necromancer. The only reason he’ll ever raise an Undead, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">ever</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">, is because he needs a proper understanding of all the concepts behind necromantic mana in order to invert it.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyOGM3OWJhOTBlZTQ4MDU5ZDM2ZDNlMjRmMjVlYmNk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Gwen blinked, looking genuinely puzzled. “I’m… not familiar with mana theory. Can you explain a bit more? You lost me at inverted necromantic mana.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmZGU2OTBiOGFmOTQwODZhNWE4ZWJmZmU0Y2JjMGE0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan cleared his throat, and all attention turned to him. “Let me put it simply for you,” he stated coolly. “The Mist is warped, necromantic-aligned mana, necro mana for short. In order to turn it back into normal mana, we need to apply its opposite to negate the necro effects. In order to get that opposite, we need to invert the necro mana. We know how to invert other kinds of mana, but we’ve never done necro mana. To get where we need to be, we need a friendly necromancer. We lucked out and found Ernesto.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwN2EzMGQzNjgzMTQ1YTNiYTQzMzA0MzQ2YmQzZmZm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan’s voice lowered into a growl as he glared across the room. “He is very possibly this world’s only hope for stopping the Mist. You will leave him alone, and out of your schemes, or so help me you’ll wish I’d just thrown you into the Mist.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTkwODg5OWM0ZjQ5YTM4M2FlMDI2YmU2M2RjMmI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn was briefly gratified to see most of the Geovans shudder, flinch, or seem otherwise appropriately cowed by the threat. Only a fool crossed an alchemist lightly. The only exception was the angular-faced woman, who merely narrowed her eyes. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5YjBhY2JmYjhmMTRmYWI4NjY4MmIxNTEyMmI0MmQx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Gwen raised her hands in abject surrender. “Got it! Got it! Depths below, I didn’t mean to bring tinder to a gas deposit! No more asking for the necromancer, message received!” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyZGYxYWNhMjEyZDQ5ZjlhM2QxZmMzNmFhMmVjZDkz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan nodded in satisfaction, then moved to stand behind Maeryn, watching silently. Maeryn didn’t move, keeping her eyes on the people in front of her. “Right then, now that that’s settled,” the hunter began. “I’m not opposed to helping you in principle. I’ll hear you out, now and in the future. But my focus is on making sure my team is able to handle the Mist just as fast as they can. As long as that’s clear? We’re fine.” She raised an eyebrow. “So, are we clear?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyYWE1OTdmYWJiZDQyN2M4ODdjYmQzODE1NDBiMWUx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Gwen let out a long breath. “Yeah. We’re clear. By the Hearth, Maeryn, you grew up scary. What </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">happened </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">these last few years?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3MmNmMTRkN2M1NzRkZWI5ZGNmNDhiMjBhN2JiN2Y5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The same thing that happened to you, I’d guess,” Maeryn replied simply. “We figured out how much time was left, and got desperate enough to break the rules.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDdlYmY1YjIzZDQxOTg4MzhiOTA0Mzk2ZThhZGVj"><span style="font-weight: 400">The round of understanding, empathetic nods that she received from her fellow Geovans was simultaneously heartening and saddening. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjNjM1NTcxY2NmYzRkNTM5MmY2OTZkODRkNmM2MDE3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now that you mention it, how much time is left?” Gwen asked, bracing herself. “When I left Geova three years ago, the estimates said we had eight or nine years left before Critical Mana Depletion, so we should have at least five years…” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDc3Zjg0NGFkOTQ5ZDVhN2RmNDNlMjcwMmRhMjFl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“If things continue as they are? A year,” Maeryn informed her bluntly. “Maybe a little more, maybe a little less. I’m leaning towards less.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZWUxZmFjNDljZDQ0N2E5NTgyMWRlMmYxZGI5MWJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Silence filled the room for a long moment, before the quiet, shy woman from before clutched her head in her hands, face twisting in despair. “A year? One, single year?” she whispered. “No… no, you’re lying. Please, you have to be lying! Tell me we at least have three!” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjODZjOTdlYTQ4OTQ4NDlhNzRkMjAzMjMxY2NmN2Mx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Farah…” the old man murmured, looking at her sympathetically. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1MTFkMDk3ZWM3MTQ1NzZhZjYxMDE2MjBjZDVjNjY4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“She’s lying!” Farah insisted desperately. “She has to be! We, I… we sacrificed too much! It can’t be true! It can’t! My… my son…!” She choked back a sob, shaking her head violently, her hair whipping around madly. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwNzQ5YTBkYzNiYzRlMzY5NTRjNGQwYjZjZGI1Mjhh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn felt her face soften as she witnessed the poor woman’s breakdown. “I wish I were lying,” she admitted quietly, doing her best to simultaneously project sympathy and sincerity into her voice and body language. “But Dan here’s an alchemist from the Alchemical Workshop. I had him double-check my findings. He did his damndest to prove me wrong. But I’m not.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmMTQ5N2I3ZTQzNTRhMzU4MjYwZWI1NTAwMGQzYzFm"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was silence in the room for a long minute as the information was digested, and Maeryn watched Farah’s face run through several expressions, from disbelief to suspicion to despair before settling on bone-deep anger. </span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZGYxMTBhYWVkOTQzNjZhZDdhM2M1ZDY1MmRiNDc4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then how?!” Farah demanded, glaring fiercely at Maeryn. “How did this happen? We, we tried so hard, we spent so long trying to buy more time! I’ve done… I’ve done terrible, terrible things… things that I can’t be forgiven for. And you’re telling me that it was all for nothing? That we didn’t succeed at all, that our civilization is doomed?!” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzNGMyMGNkYTlmNzRlZGE5MjcxNzU4MWZkYmNkNzhk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Farah slammed her fists into her desk, and sharp, jagged spikes of ice crackled into existence around the impact. A wave of frosty air rippled through the room, which Maeryn had to brace herself against with a grimace. Farah was stronger than she looked. “I can’t accept that! I won’t accept that! Tell me where it went wrong! TELL ME!” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyNjEwNTcxYjQ5MzRhZTFhMGM3MDk3NDBhMmIzNDlm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn felt a lump form in her throat. The woman’s pain was palpable, and she just… couldn’t find the words. She couldn’t just say nothing; Farah looked half a breath away from taking her pain out on Maeryn, and the hunter didn’t have the heart to subdue her violently. But… what was there to say? </span></p>
<p class="cnM2NzdmOWUyMzBiNTQ3NTNiYjI1NjRmMzdlYWQ0NWQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Thankfully, Dan cleared his throat and stepped in. “We don’t know,” he admitted, his voice anguished. “I’ve tried to figure it out. I tried for years before we left Geova, but we haven’t found the reason why the rate of mana depletion keeps accelerating. We’ve worked hard at home, too, replacing magic with alternatives wherever possible, and making what mana we have to use more efficient. But we just don’t know why it keeps depleting faster.” His body slumped, visibly defeated. “I’m sorry.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMxMjBhYjkxNjhlYzQ5ZmFiMmY4NjhmM2QxNWY3Yzkx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s not good enough!” Farah shrieked, her hands white with tension as she tightly clutched at the front of her desk. Frost bloomed around her, encasing the desk rapidly and beginning to snap and crackle across the floor. The hair on Maeryn’s neck pricked up; if Farah went much further, if she abandoned control over her magic, she might not have a choice but to knock her out. “My son is two and a half years old! I came here before his first birthday so I could make sure he had a future! I left him and my husband behind, sacrificing everything for them, and you’re telling me that my son won’t ever turn four? He won’t even get his first day of preschool?!” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiM2U4YmZkM2JkYzQ1YjRhYzI4ODJmNjhhN2NlMzZh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn’s fists clenched of their own accord. This was the moment. She’d manage to talk Farah down, or she’d have to knock her unconscious. “It’s not hopeless yet,” she answered, doing her best to sound confident, calm and soothing. It was a gamble; such a tone might anger Farah further, or it might calm her down. But it was the best she had. “Remember that we have a plan to purify the Mist and turn it back into usable mana. We just need time for Dan and Ernesto to finish creating the inverted necro mana. We finish that, and we can protect Geova from any Mist incursions.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZDMwMmQ1Mjk3YjQyNDViMWNkYjdkOWRhNjZmODJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">The angular-faced woman opened her mouth and spoke for the first time since Maeryn had arrived, her voice sounding oddly melodic and smooth. “How confident are you in this plan?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhNjg1YzQxYmE1ZDQxMDQ5ZWVkNjNmZTcyNjAwNTE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">At her words, every single other member of the Geovan cell went very still and quiet, even Farah. Her icy rage dissipated as quickly as it had come, the aura of cold she’d been manifesting winking out as if it’d never been, leaving only the icicles and frost as evidence of its existence. Her shoulders slumped, her eyes darting toward the angular-faced woman, lips pressed into a thin, trembling line. Maeryn blinked, cataloging the reaction; it almost looked as though they were all afraid of her. But why? </span></p>
<p class="cnMzNjAwYTU5YTg0ZTQxZjA4NDQyOTUwNGU1MTYwZTY3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m eighty-nine percent sure the plan will work,” Dan asserted. “And one hundred percent sure that even if it’s not a perfect solution, it will buy us time, at least enough to refine it into something workable.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiMGUxZGJkNzNiOTQ0OTdhODQ3NzYwOWFkY2U2MGJk"><span style="font-weight: 400">The sharp-looking woman nodded thoughtfully, and Maeryn could almost feel the other members of the terrorist cell holding their breath. This woman held power, real power in this group. There were dynamics here that Maeryn didn’t understand, but this woman was a decision-maker with even more authority than Gwen. Somehow. She was someone to watch. “And you’re certain you can create this inverted necro mana before it’s too late?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM4Y2Q0MjFkMTdjZTQzZGI5ZjE1NGU4OTljODk1YjU5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes,” Dan agreed simply. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1NGU5M2I0YWY4ODQyYjZiNGE1MzM5ODc4MjQ5MDBl"><span style="font-weight: 400">The woman drummed her fingers idly against her desk, looking not at Dan, but at Maeryn. “You lack the resources to support you and your team indefinitely,” she uttered softly, calmly… and yet Maeryn felt the hair on the back of her neck prickle. This woman was a threat. Maeryn didn’t know how yet, but she was. “You need resources, and the ability to go where you please, while also remaining below notice. Not an easy combination… but not impossible.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3YzE4ZWMxZmZkYTQxYmVhNzE0YzVlNDhmYWJkOGQ1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Erina…” Gwen whispered, her voice quivering with uncertainty. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyYjU2NzA0MzBkYzRiNGJhNDhlMmQzOTJjMGQzMWU5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Some advice for you, Captain Maeryn d’Vert.” Erina’s hand abruptly stilled as her gaze turned intense. “Look into the Nightshade family. Your rogue friend will know more. You might find some helpful resources there. We’ll be in contact.” She turned to Gwen, her facial expression unchanging. “We should go. We’ve already lingered too long.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlODI1ZjE1MmY2NTQxNWNiYjdmYmQ5NjI5YTU0ZjJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Gwen nodded shakily, looking at Erina for a split second for confirmation before continuing to speak. “R-right. Maeryn, the dose we gave your friend should have worn off by now. You’ll be able to wake him up easily. But it’s time to go.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZWU4OTFmMmY3NTQxZjliNTg0ZmQyYjc0Njc1NDc4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Dan.” Maeryn’s command was silent, but the alchemist immediately moved to wake Terrance. While he was busy with that, Maeryn eyed Gwen and Erina, her mind whirling as the various Geovans immediately got up and left, giving Maeryn a wide berth. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkODNiMzgxNGI3MzQ3Mzk4ZTkzMzljNDBkMDhkZmRl"><span style="font-weight: 400">The ex-hunter nodded respectfully at her as he passed. “Good hunting.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5NzI1MTY1ODA3MjRlYWRiOTdiMTA1OWQzMThjN2Y3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good hunting,” Maeryn replied in kind with a nod of her own, receiving a crooked smile as the man hurried off. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2OGZmMWQwZWFjYzRjNzFhZTc2ZGFmYzE2MDQwNTVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Gwen paused as she passed Maeryn. “It… really was good to see you, Maeryn. I hope we can catch up sometime.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNkNGQyZTQxZGRiYzRkMGZiNzAzNTg1MDExNWRiYTQz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn thought about it, then nodded sharply. “I think I’d like that. Leave a message for me at the hotel with a time and a place.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM4NDQ1ZTBhYWRmZTQ3NmY5Mzc3NzE2YWY5ZjMxYzEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Will do.” With that, Gwen departed. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiODg1NGZkYzQ5YjRiNzI4NWQ1ZTlmMmQ5NWVhNTRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh…” Terrance groaned, and Maeryn strode over to where the rogue was slowly picking himself up, obviously groggy and recovering from whatever he’d been drugged with. “Where is she?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlMzExYWUwZDc3NTRmYzRhMmI2MGUzMjMwM2JkMTc1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where’s who?” Maeryn asked. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzODY0MzNiZGMwMTQ1YjhhM2FmNzlhZjlkYzI0N2Q3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maeryn? You’re… wait. How long was I out…? Where am I?” Terrance stood up straight, then immediately winced and placed a hand to his forehead, visibly regretting it as he leaned against the wall for support. “Urgh… definitely not okay yet. Can I get some help?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjYzRhZjAyOWRkYTQ1YjY4MjQ1OGE4ZTBjMjhlN2Mx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn and Dan flanked him, allowing Terrance to put his arms around their shoulders. “Come on. Let’s get back to the hotel.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZmYwMGZmZWI1MjRmOTk4MTA0Y2NlM2FjYmFkMjJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. And you can fill me in as we go,” Terrance agreed, and they all started moving towards the exit. “But I have to know. Where is she? The woman who overheard us, the woman who caught and drugged me.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiOGUwNDY0NTBjMjQyM2ZiMWExZjk3YzM4Yjc3ODQx"><span style="font-weight: 400">That was probably Erina. “She’s gone,” Maeryn told him. “She was just here until a few minutes ago. Why?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwM2QyMDE4NTBhZTQ1YWM4YjAwNmFjYWJkN2VkYmNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance’s fists clenched, and Maeryn could almost hear him grinding his teeth. “Maeryn… that woman…” His voice was tight, his face twisting with a combination of emotions that she couldn’t readily identify from her position at his side. “Maeryn, I think that woman was the one who killed my parents.” </span></p>
