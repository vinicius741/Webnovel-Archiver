<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnNmNzQ4ZTVhYzQ3ZDQyNzc5MTllYzUzZWJhNGYwZDEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">The rain had that particular smell that came just before a proper storm; metallic and sharp, like blood mixed with lightning. Vertigo crouched in the shadows overlooking Yolanda's compound, counting guard rotations for the third time because Commander had beaten it into his head that assumptions got people killed. The improvised watchtowers jutting from each corner looked like shipping containers welded to scaffolding, which they probably were. Everything had that cobbled-together look of salvage dressed up as functionality.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZjhhMjk3OWUzMTQ1ZDI5ZGZkYTU0ZDU5YjRjMTM2"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Two minutes until rotation," he muttered, watching a pair of guards disappear around the building's eastern corner. They moved with the casual indifference of men who'd been doing the same circuit for months without incident. That was about to change.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYTdhNjAwNTZjNDQ2YzE4MDdmN2NlMTdlZjgwM2I5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Beside him, Kaelan's silver hair caught what little moonlight filtered through the gathering storm clouds. She had that preternatural stillness that always made him wonder if angels even needed to breathe. "Electronic locks on the service entrance," she confirmed, her voice barely above a whisper. "I can bypass them, but we'll need to move fast once we're inside."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMTBiNzc5MGRhNTRjYjFhNjk0MWMwZTA0NjNkMzU1"><span style="font-weight: 400">On his other side, Argent shifted nervously. The approaching storm responded to her presence, wind picking up and sending her raggedly cropped hair dancing around her face. "The warehouse is there, right?" she asked, pointing to a squat structure across the compound. "The medical supplies and equipment."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMjcyMjQxZDcxNzQwMTFiM2U4OTJhNTUyM2E3NmM1"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Get as much as you can carry," Vertigo confirmed. "Remember, rendezvous at the mill in two hours, regardless of what happens."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMjAyMmIzMDEzNzQ2Zjc4ZjkxYzA0MzhlNmMzNDUz"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Agreed," Argent said, though something in her tone made him glance at her sharply. There was a quality to her voice he hadn't heard before; determination, maybe, or the kind of resignation that came before someone did something spectacularly stupid. Before he could question it she was already dissolving into mist, her form becoming indistinct as she drifted toward the eastern warehouse like fog with a purpose.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYzI3ZmMyOTNhZDQyNzBhYzhkYzEwNjI4MWMxZTUy"><span style="font-weight: 400">The guard rotation began exactly on schedule. Two men departed their posts, boots echoing off the compound's brick walls as they headed for whatever passed for a break room in this place. Their replacements wouldn't arrive for another three minutes… just enough time for two people to slip inside if they knew what they were doing.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkODExYjQ0OTA2NTQ2OWZhZGNmNmQ1YTRkOWJiZjkx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaelan moved like a ghost, appearing beside the remaining guards before they even registered her presence. The first man never saw her coming; a precisely delivered strike to his temple dropped him without so much as a grunt. The second started to turn at his partner's collapse but Vertigo was already there. One arm snaked around the guard's throat while his other hand found the pressure point at the base of his skull. The man's struggles lasted only seconds before he went limp, his weapon clattering to the ground.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZGQ4NjQ3ZmI1NTRlYTA4ODUyNWI2MDg4N2RmZjMx"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Clear," Kaelan whispered, already dragging her unconscious target into the shadows behind a stack of supply crates.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTI0OWVhYzk3NzRhYmQ4Y2NlMDc5ZjUyZWRmOGQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400">They worked quickly, using strips torn from the guards' own uniforms to bind and gag them. Vertigo retrieved the access card from the senior guard's belt, a rectangle of salvaged plastic embedded with copper wiring and etched with Yolanda's clenched fist sigil. The thing looked like it had been cobbled together from three different sources, which probably meant it had been.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOGYxMDZhMTczYTQ5YjFhMGI3Y2NkYjgwOTE2MWM5"><span style="font-weight: 400">The service entrance loomed before them, steel plates welded over what had probably once been a normal door. Someone had installed a card reader that blinked red lights in mocking sequence. Vertigo swiped the card through the reader, and for a heart-stopping moment, nothing happened. Then the lights shifted to green and the lock disengaged with a soft click. The corridor beyond stretched into darkness, lit only by the occasional emergency bulb jury-rigged to the walls with electrical tape and wishful thinking. They moved through the compound like smoke, their footsteps muffled by years of accumulated dust and debris. Two more guards fell to their silent approach. Each unconscious form was dragged into shadows, bound, and left where they wouldn't be easily discovered.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NDU4YmI1M2Q3MDRlOGQ5ZGRkZGFlNDdkNDE0MWQ2"><span style="font-weight: 400">The detention area lay at the compound's heart, accessed through a heavy door marked with warnings in three languages. Vertigo’s jaw clenched as he read the signs: "AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY," "DANGEROUS CARGO," and worst of all, "INVENTORY INSIDE." The last one made something cold and furious settle in his gut.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYWJkODg1YmRmMjQxOTlhYmJhNjE4NmMzMzVlZjY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaelan studied the lock mechanism, which was considerably more complex than the others they'd encountered. Multiple card readers, what looked like a biometric scanner, and enough blinking lights to stock a small festival. "This is going to take a moment," she said. "Stand back." She placed her palms against the control panel, her expression shifting into the intense concentration he'd seen her use during their training sessions. Tiny arcs of electricity danced between her fingers as she sent a carefully controlled current into the system. The panel sparked, smoking slightly, and filled the air with the acrid scent of burning circuits. The lock disengaged.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNWVmNGY2OWExNzQxM2NiZGJlNGZiZWRmODYxY2Rl"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Useful trick," Vertigo commented, impressed despite himself.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYzI1MTM1ZjY2ZDRmMWViZjExMGNmODE1ODEwMjk4"><span style="font-weight: 400">The detention area had once been the building's main assembly hall, its high ceiling supported by ornate columns that spoke of better days. Now those columns were wrapped with chains and shackles, while the open floor space had been divided into a maze of cages. Some were large enough for multiple occupants, others barely big enough for a single person to lie down. The sight hit him like a punch to the gut. Faces turned toward them from behind metal mesh - human faces marked by exhaustion, malnutrition, hopeless resignation. Men, women, and worst of all, children. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3YjQzOGU1MTcxMTQyZDM4ZWMwODc1NjFmZjMxMDI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo felt something break inside his chest, followed by a rage so intense it made his vision blur red around the edges. Heat began to build in his palms despite his efforts at control, that familiar prickle that preceded flame. These weren't enemy combatants or rival mercenaries. These were innocents whose only crime had been possessing abilities they couldn't help, or being unfortunate enough to cross Yolanda's path at the wrong moment. How many times had he been in similar danger as a child? How many times had Commander's protection been all that stood between him and a cage just like these? The thought made his hands shake with barely contained fury.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMGUxODQ5MzFhNDRlNzViMWY0NWFlNTIxN2IyNzEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Control." Kaelan's voice cut through his rage, her hand settling on his arm with surprising gentleness. The contact was warm, grounding, pulling him back from the edge of an explosion that would help no one. He forced himself to breathe, to push the fire back beneath his skin where it belonged. She was right, of course. These people needed rescue, not an explosion that might kill them along with their captors.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YjgyYjhjNTg0ODRlYmNiMGQyMWUzZjE2Zjk3ZGYx"><span style="font-weight: 400">The captives stirred as they entered, hope and fear warring in their expressions. A woman stepped forward inside one of the larger cages, placing herself protectively in front of the children caged with her. Her clothes were torn and dirty, her dark hair streaked with premature gray, but she held herself with the dignity of someone who refused to be broken no matter what they threw at her. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTkxOTE4ZTk5YjQxYmViMDk3Y2I3NzdhYWY5YWEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Who sent you?" she demanded, her voice hoarse but steady. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxZWFkNzcxZWI5ODRmMTU5NmQ3ODI0YTQxNDliY2Y3"><span style="font-weight: 400">"No one you know," Kaelan answered, already moving toward the cage locks with businesslike efficiency. "But we're here to get you out."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjODlmZTFmMDMwNzQxM2ZhNGUxMjc3NDc2ODJmOTlm"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Why should we trust you?" The woman's eyes narrowed, taking in their weapons and obvious combat readiness. Behind her, a young boy peered out with curious eyes that reminded Vertigo painfully of his own childhood; too smart for his own good, too young to understand how fucked the world really was.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTI3NWQ1MjNiOTQ5ZmZiNmQ4MWY5ODIyMGZkZmNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Because we're offering freedom," Vertigo replied, crouching down to the boy's eye level. Something about the child reminded him of himself at that age: the same mix of fear and defiance, the same desperate need to appear strong when everything around you was falling apart. "And because if we wanted to hurt you, we'd have done it already."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYmQ4MTUzYWU1YTRlNmZiOGYwZTgzMGE4YmRjOGNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">The woman studied their faces for a long moment, her gaze moving between them with careful assessment. Finally, she nodded sharply. "I'm Mara. What's the plan?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMzM2I4YzlmMWVhYTRmYTZiOTc3ZDQwMzg1MzkxMTFk"><span style="font-weight: 400">"We move quietly," Kaelan instructed, the first lock springing open in a shower of sparks that made everyone flinch. "Stay together. Follow our lead exactly. If we say hide, you hide. If we say run, you run. No questions, no hesitation." Her voice carried the authority of someone accustomed to being obeyed. The captives wore limiting collars keeping them from accessing their Talents, and she made short work of those as well as she moved from cage to cage.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMTY2NjA4OGQ4ZTRhMGU4MzQzMDIyODZlYjA2MzAy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo found himself drawn back to the boy. The child approached him without the fear the others showed, studying Vertigo's face with intensity. There was something old in those young eyes, the kind of premature wisdom that came from seeing too much too early. "Are you like me too?" the boy asked, his voice barely above a whisper.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYmQ4NWEwY2JmNTRkMTU4YjE5YWQwOGJiZjk5ZmE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">"What do you mean?" Vertigo replied, though he suspected he already knew.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMmZlNjliZjkzNDQ3YzY5ODM2ZjgwYzUxNzhhZTQ4"><span style="font-weight: 400">The boy glanced around nervously, then held out his palm. The air above his skin crystallized into a delicate flower of ice, perfect in every detail. "They took me because of this," he said. "Said I was worth a lot of money to the right buyer."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyM2ExYTJmMGI0ZTQzMTc5NmRiN2RlNDI2YzRlNjgw"><span style="font-weight: 400">The casual way he said it made something twist in Vertigo's gut. "Yeah, kid," he said, his voice rougher than he'd intended. This child would spend his life running, hiding, fighting to control powers he'd never asked for. "I'm like you." He held up his own hand and let a small flame dance across his palm, warm orange light that cast dancing shadows on the boy's face. "And that's why I'm getting you out of here."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTNmOGNkNDY2NTQyMGZhYjEzM2E4Mzc1Njg4NDkw"><span style="font-weight: 400">"They were going to sell us tomorrow," the boy confided. "I heard the guards talking. Said we were part of a special shipment going south." The matter-of-fact way he delivered this information was somehow more horrifying than if he'd been crying.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZTY5MjAzMzIwMTRjZWI5OWE2YWFmZTExZTk2NDQ2"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Well, they're not anymore," Vertigo assured him, ruffling the kid's hair with more gentleness than he usually managed. "Stay close to me, okay? I'm Vertigo. What's your name?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YTI4ZTlhMWI3NzRiNTE4ZGM1NWE2N2FhMTMyYjA0"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Dai," the boy said, then added with heartbreaking formality, "Thank you for coming for us."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZjRkNzJkMDVjOTQ5OTU5ZTNkNzU1NjljZjUxYzg2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaelan finished freeing the last captives; twelve in all, ranging in age from Dai, who couldn't have been more than eight, to an elderly man who moved stiffly but with determined dignity. "Northwest tunnel?" she suggested, referencing the map Commander had shown them.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OWJlYjgxYjRhZDQwMTNiYTQ0NGYzZWM3MzJkZTRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo nodded. "Fastest route out, assuming our information is good."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NDYxODMyYzFkNDQ4NTViNGUzNzExM2VjMTQ2MzY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">"And if it isn't?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOGUwYjRhZjU5ODRiN2I4NjBkMGIwNWNmMDg3YjIy"><span style="font-weight: 400">He patted the hilt of his sword. "Then we improvise."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDRhYjliZDAxNTQ3MDViMWEzN2UyMTIzOTNkMWZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">They moved through the compound as silently as possible, the captives showing a discipline that spoke well of Mara's leadership. She helped organize the others, particularly the children, while keeping a protective eye on Dai, who had attached himself to Vertigo like a shadow. The kid stuck so close that Vertigo could feel his warmth through his cloak.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZmQ0NDhjMDE3ZTQwZTQ5NTFlNzQ4ODM4YTIwYmZk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Twice they were forced to duck into side rooms when patrols passed too close to their route. Once, Kaelan silently dispatched a lone guard who turned a corner at precisely the wrong moment, her precise strike dropping him unconscious before he could raise an alarm. Each time, the captives waited in perfect silence, understanding instinctively that their lives depended on it. They'd learned the hard way what happened when you made noise at the wrong time.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZWQ4MjdlMmFmYzRjNTE5NzllZmFmYmFmYzc5NTJh"><span style="font-weight: 400">The northwest tunnel entrance appeared exactly where their intelligence had placed it. It was a service corridor that had been converted into a smuggling route, its walls lined with moisture and smelling of damp earth and old sewage. Emergency lighting cast sickly yellow pools every few yards, but beyond their reach darkness pressed in from all sides. Vertigo took point, his senses heightened by adrenaline and the constant awareness that they were leading innocents through hostile territory. Behind him, the captives moved in single file, their breathing and soft footsteps the only sounds in the oppressive quiet. Kaelan brought up the rear, her attention split between watching for pursuit and monitoring their charges for signs of exhaustion or panic.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNmU1YzVkNzI5MDRlODNiYTA1MWU4MzcwYmY3NmVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">They were halfway through the tunnel when disaster struck.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NjczMDNjYjRkMTRlMjViNjQ3YzMwMDMxNDA0MDZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">The alarm began as a low electronic whine that quickly rose to an ear-splitting shriek. Emergency lights flashed red, turning the tunnel into a hellish strobe-lit nightmare. Somewhere behind them, voices shouted orders and boots pounded against concrete floors with the rhythmic precision of trained soldiers.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3M2YwOTlkYjFjMzRlOTVhYTU0MDgyY2UxOTZiZWEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">"They found the guards," Kaelan said tersely, her voice barely audible over the alarm. "Move faster."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzY2VjMzViODUwODQzNmQ5YjI5NDUyOWM4NjNkZDlj"><span style="font-weight: 400">The captives needed no encouragement. Fear lent them speed and they pushed forward through the tunnel with the desperation of people who knew exactly what would happen if they were recaptured. Dai stayed close to Vertigo's side, his small hand clutching at the hem of Vertigo's cloak like a lifeline.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDVhYTljMWNkZTRhNzc5ZjE4YjRjNmMzNDdiZmU2"><span style="font-weight: 400">The tunnel began to slope upward, and ahead of them, a darker patch against the gloom promised the night sky and escape. Then, silhouetted against that promise of freedom, a familiar figure appeared, and Vertigo's heart sank to somewhere around his boots.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjODJlMTI4YjE0NDRmODRiNzM5ZDZlNjk1ZmYwMmM4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dominique stood framed by the tunnel exit, her red hair catching the emergency lighting like flames. Her eyes glowed with malicious satisfaction, and behind her, at least six armed figures spread out in a practiced formation that cut off their only escape route. They moved with the fluid precision of people who'd done this before, people who knew their business. "Well, well," she purred, her voice carrying easily in the confined space despite the continuing alarm. "Isn't this interesting? Vertigo, darling, you've led me quite a chase."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlODdjOGQ4OTA1YjRhMDVhZjU0ZTc0NDdlNmNlYTEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">The captives froze, terror rippling through their ranks. Dai's grip on his cloak tightened until his knuckles went white. "Get back," Vertigo ordered, tensing into a combat stance. He sensed Kaelan behind him, moving to his side with the fluid grace of someone preparing for violence.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZWEzM2I2MDg1YjQ5YWM4ZTJiOGQ1ZTY5NmVjZDQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dominique's smile widened as she took in their defensive posture, her gaze drifting over the huddled captives. "Really, Vertigo? After everything I offered you in Asapaco? The position, the power, the chance to be something more than Commander's lackey?" Her voice dripped with mock disappointment. "And here you are, stealing the Chief's property. She'll be so very disappointed."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOTAwNTNmYzQ2NzRjNWY4MTIzYWY1ZDNmNzdjNjA5"><span style="font-weight: 400">"These people aren't property," he snarled, stepping forward to place himself more directly between Dominique and the captives. The rage was building again, hotter and more focused than before, that familiar fire in his veins that promised violence and satisfaction. "And we're walking out of here. All of us."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4M2ZmMTEwODcwMzQ5MDI4ZTc2NDA5ODI0OGFmNjNm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dominique's laugh was cold and bitter, echoing off the tunnel walls. "Oh, but they are property. Bought and paid for. You're interfering with a very expensive business transaction." Her expression hardened. "I offered you everything. Power. Position. A place at Yolanda's side where you could make a real difference. Instead, you chose to die in a filthy tunnel protecting livestock."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZDVjYzkwMTVlNzRiZGFhZTEzNDdjZTY2ZThkOWEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Vertigo." Kaelan's voice next to him was quiet but urgent. "Get them out."</span></p><span class="cjM0NjA1Y2U5ZDcwMjQ2MzNhNjU1ZDE2YWZlM2VmODli"><br/>The narrative has been taken without authorization; if you see it on Amazon, report the incident.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM4MzgxYjc3Mzk2ZTQ0ZjE4ZjEyOGExOTgxM2FjNzdi"><span style="font-weight: 400">For once, he didn't argue with her tone of command. The tactical situation was clear; they were outnumbered, outgunned, and trapped in a confined space with no room to maneuver and innocent lives at stake. "Everyone back!" he ordered the captives, spreading his arms to press them backward. Dai's hand found his, small fingers clutching desperately at his larger ones. "Mara," he hissed, "get them to the intersection. There should be a maintenance passage to the left. Get as far as you can and don't look back."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDA3MjhiOWEzMzQ1ZWM5MThhOGVhZjQzOWJmMDY4"><span style="font-weight: 400">"What about you?" Dai asked, his young voice tight with fear but also with a loyalty that broke Vertigo's heart.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZjQ1ZDMzMzlkZjRlMzI4YTRlOTIyMTQzZTg3ZWNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">"I'll be right behind you," Vertigo lied, knowing the boy was too smart to believe it but hoping he'd play along anyway. "Now go."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YmQ5MDBlZDQ5OTRmYWE4ODRiZjJiN2EwZWFiYzU0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaelan stepped forward, her silver hair seeming to float in the charged air around her as electricity danced between her fingers like living things. She could have ended the confrontation in seconds; one gesture, one strike of lightning channeled through the tunnel's metal fixtures, and Dominique and her entire crew would be nothing but charred corpses. The power crackled around her, visible and terrible and barely contained.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZGI5YTcyZjEyNzQwZGY5MTMyNjRjM2RlNmE4OTNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">But Kaelan stood perfectly still, and Vertigo watched something far more complex than simple combat calculation play across her features. "Interesting," she murmured, and it was obvious she was thinking several moves ahead of everyone else in the tunnel. "Vertigo, how long would it take Yolanda to relocate her entire operation if her lieutenant mysteriously disappeared tonight?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZjM5NDU0NDNkZjQ4MjhiZjFmNzFkZDQyMzBkN2My"><span style="font-weight: 400">Understanding dawned with cold clarity. "Hours," he replied. "She'd assume we broke Dominique, extracted everything we could. The whole network would scatter. Secondary locations, emergency protocols, dead drops. Everything." It was the kind of tactical thinking that made Commander so dangerous: seeing not just the immediate battle, but the war beyond it.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YmVhNjAzNjMyNjRjNGI4NTNhOGMwNDFhNmI4Y2Q2"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Exactly." Kaelan's silver eyes never left Dominique, who had gone very still. The red-haired woman was many things, but she wasn't stupid. She could read the writing on the wall as well as anyone. "So I could kill her now. Save these dozen lives, feel righteously satisfied, and accomplish absolutely nothing in the long term. Or..."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlODBlYmY2Yzk2ODQ5YmJiMTExZTI5MGNjNzczYjI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Or you let me walk out of here," Dominique finished, her voice carefully controlled. All her earlier bravado had evaporated, replaced by the cautious tone of someone who had just realized they were alive only because a predator was considering larger prey. "How very... pragmatic of you."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YzExZWI5YzNhNDRhYjY4ZTUyZWU4MzA4ZDc4MDEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Hardly pragmatic," Kaelan corrected with dangerous softness. "Simple mathematics. Twelve lives now, or hundreds later. The only question is whether you're intelligent enough to play your assigned role."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkY2UzZGZmNzdmODQ5YzVhMGQ5ZjQwYTgzMzQ5Yjg4"><span style="font-weight: 400">"And what role would that be?" Dominique asked, though Vertigo could see she already knew the answer.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NDEwM2EwYWQyMzQ3Y2U4NWY1ODIxNmJlMmNjMDI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">"The survivor. The loyal lieutenant who fought valiantly against overwhelming odds but couldn't prevent the raiders from escaping with their prize." Kaelan took a single step forward; just one, but Dominique flinched as if she'd been struck. "You report back to Yolanda. Business continues as usual. Routes remain stable."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZGViNGRkYmJlNzQwYWFhMWNmMmI0ZTg2M2E4MzRj"><span style="font-weight: 400">"You're assuming I won't warn-" Dominique began.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NzZlNmI4YjljODRkNzU4YmQ3MDk4ZmMwN2MwMGRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">"You'll warn no one," Kaelan interrupted, and for just a moment, lightning flickered in her eyes. Not a threat, merely a reminder of what she was capable of. "Because you're intelligent enough to know that I'm the only reason you're still breathing. And you're selfish enough to want to keep breathing, even if it means betraying everyone who trusts you."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNDk0YWZhZjhiMDRlMGE5OGU3MzU4NzM1NDkxNTg1"><span style="font-weight: 400">For a heartbeat, Vertigo thought Dominique might accept the bargain. Her green eyes flickered between Kaelan's implacable stare and the electrical energy still dancing around her fingers, clearly weighing her chances of surviving a direct confrontation. He knew firsthand how powerful Kaelan's aura was.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYzVlNDZiODAwZjQwNjNhN2EwMTM2MTVhODVmMjY5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she smiled, and Vertigo knew they were in trouble.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ODk2M2NiNjQyYTRiNGRhYzQzODVkNDczOWQwMGJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">"You know," Dominique said conversationally, "I think I'll take option number three." She dropped to one knee and slammed her palm against the tunnel floor. Flames spread outward from the point of contact in a rapidly expanding circle.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNWIyZTY3YTJkOTQ0NzdiMTkwMWU2YTM4NTllYzM1"><span style="font-weight: 400">"What the-" he began, then the implications crashed over him like a cold wave. "Gas lines! Get down!"</span></p>
<p class="cnNmY2NmYmQ1N2ViMDQ3NThiM2Y3YWVlMjlmOWExNGQ4"><span style="font-weight: 400">The warning came too late. The tunnel erupted in a chain of explosions as the flames reached the improvised gas lines that fed the emergency lighting. Support beams that had survived decades of neglect finally surrendered to forces they'd never been designed to withstand. The ceiling began to collapse in sections, tons of earth and broken concrete raining down.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYzhhMmU4Mzk1NjQxODk5ZTFkMGRmZWIyNjA0ZDQ0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo's world narrowed to a single point of clarity. Without conscious thought, he lunged toward Kaelan, tackling her away from a falling support beam that would have crushed her skull like an eggshell. They went down together in a tangle of limbs, his larger frame instinctively curling around her as debris crashed down around them. Pain lanced through his back as something heavy struck him, but he held on, shielding her from the worst of it.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMmNiMjliYTU1MjQzMmQ5NmU4MjAwNzMwZGNjMjI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then there was only the crushing weight of rubble and the taste of dust and blood.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTdjZGVlMGFiMDQzNTM4Y2Y5MGVhODI2MzQxNjAy"> </p>
<hr/>
<p class="cnM3NDE2YTdhNDBiMjQ0OTNhZWU0NTBkY2QwM2VhY2U1"> </p>
<p class="cnNjODBjYTA4MzIzNDQ5M2ZhZGViMDYyNGIwYWFkNTc5"><span style="font-weight: 400">"...up. Wake up."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYTY0NWRmODUzNjQxMzhhYTg3MmIyNmMyNzFiYzNm"><span style="font-weight: 400">The voice seemed to come from very far away. Vertigo struggled toward consciousness, aware first of the crushing weight pressing down on his back, then of an uncomfortable warmth beneath him that resolved into something much more immediate and alarming.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNzZiODE1NTk2MDQzM2FiYmFiMGI4NTlhMDk3Yjdj"><span style="font-weight: 400">He opened his eyes to find himself staring into Kaelan's silver ones, their faces inches apart in the suffocating darkness. Somehow, impossibly, they had survived the collapse, trapped in a small pocket of space where fallen beams had created an accidental shelter. A soft blue-white shimmer emanated from somewhere nearby, casting everything in an otherworldly glow.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNzg3ZGZjYzE4ZTQwNmJhNTM4NmRiOGVkYTI5NDk2"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Don't move," she cautioned, her voice strained with effort. "I'm holding most of the weight up with a barrier, but the structural integrity is marginal at best. One wrong shift and we could bring the rest down on top of us."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NzUxZWFmY2UzNTQ2NWU5ODdjNWNhOTgwMDZlNjIy"><span style="font-weight: 400">He became fully aware of their position then, really, truly aware of it in a way that made his cheeks burn despite their circumstances. He had landed on top of her when he tackled her away from the falling beam, and now they were pressed together in intimate proximity that would have been awkward under the best of circumstances. His arms cradled her head, his body shielding hers from the debris above, every point of contact between them radiating warmth in the cold darkness.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOTA0ZDc5NTgyOTQ3ODQ4MjhiZGMzMDRiMDIxNDk2"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Are you hurt?" he asked, his voice rough with dust and embarrassment.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MTgxZmVkMTkwZDQ0YTdiM2FiNzM5OWQyNmEwZjQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Nothing serious," she replied, though he could see a cut above her eye where blood had trailed down her temple in a thin red line. "You?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OTcwMTA2NTZlMjRjNTY5YzI3ZTcxYTRjYWY5YWVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">He did a quick mental inventory, cataloging various aches and pains. His back ached like fire, and there was a sharp pain in his left shoulder that suggested something was probably dislocated, but nothing serious. "Back feels like someone used it for hammer practice, but nothing's broken." He started to shift his weight to relieve the pressure on her, only to freeze as the rubble above them groaned ominously. "Any ideas on how to get out of here without becoming pancakes?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NTY0YjM4Yjc5MDQ4MjY5NWFmOTE2NjlkNWFhOWU2"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Working on it," she said, her face a mask of concentration as she maintained whatever force was keeping them from being crushed. "I could try to blast our way out, but..."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOTQ0OTg4MmM0ODRkYWFhNThjOGZkOGI3YTI0MjE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">"But we might bring down everything that's still standing," he finished grimly. "Great."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYWQ5ZDUzOWFlMzQxYTg5NTEzMzAxMmQ2ZTgxYTFi"><span style="font-weight: 400">They fell into silence, the only sounds their breathing and the occasional creak of settling debris. Vertigo found himself acutely aware of every detail; the warmth of Kaelan's body beneath his, the subtle scent of ozone that always seemed to cling to her, the way her chest rose and fell with each carefully controlled breath. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZTk2NzNiODI2ODQ0MGJhNzZjYmExYTJiY2I4ZTlh"><span style="font-weight: 400">"You saved my life," she said quietly, studying his face in the dim light.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNzAzMzM3ZTM2YTQ2MGM4NjFkM2I2OTg3NjdmODAw"><span style="font-weight: 400">"You'd have done the same," he replied, though even as he said it, he wasn't entirely sure it was true.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MWQxMzc1NDUyZTQwYmU4MGQ1ZmVkZjc4NWVjZDBl"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Would I?" There was something almost vulnerable in the question, as if she genuinely didn't know the answer.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NWRkODg2OGE1MTRhYjE4MmE0ZThmZWI2OGUwOGFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Before he could respond, a faint sound reached them. Voices calling their names, muffled by tons of debris but unmistakably real. Hope flared in Vertigo's chest as he recognized Argent's voice among the search party.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NzBmZTA4NzY1MzQyZWI4OTU3Zjk4MDMwMzM2YmNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Here!" he shouted, immediately regretting it as dust rained down on them from the disturbed rubble. More quietly, he added, "We're here!" The debris above them began to move, lifted away piece by careful piece. Light filtered through the gaps, not daylight but the warm glow of lanterns and torches. Then Argent's face appeared in the opening, her indigo eyes wide with relief and concern.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNjBiNTY5YmM5NjQyZDk5Yjk5OTE0YjM4OTEzZWEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Found them!" she called to someone behind her. To Vertigo and Kaelan, she added, "Hold still. We'll have you out in a moment."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMjUxNjc0MmE0NDRiY2Q4ZjkzOWU1NjA1MTkwODM0"><span style="font-weight: 400">True to her word, they were soon free. Mara stood with Argent, along with two other adults from the group of captives. Their faces showed the strain of recent violence, but their eyes held a fierce satisfaction. "The others?" Kaelan asked immediately, her first concern for the people they'd come to rescue.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNjQ5ZGE1MmNjNDQyNDE5YmJkOWY0YTY5MzQ3MTY1"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Safe," Argent assured her. "I found them outside the tunnel and showed them to the mill, then came back for you."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNGY5YzBlODdmZTQ4MTk5YmViYmZkNGE4ZjVmOTdk"><span style="font-weight: 400">"What happened?" Vertigo asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYzViYzJjZDYxMDRiMDE5MzI4ODQ1NTFjNWIyNjA5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Argent and Mara exchanged glances before the older woman gestured for them to follow. "Better to show you."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNzgzMmU2ZjJlNjRhZjBiYzkzZWVlMmM2NGVlYWNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">She led them through the maintenance passage, which opened into a larger storage area that had been completely devastated. Crates were smashed open, their contents scattered across the floor. Scorch marks streaked the walls where fires had been deliberately set, and the air reeked of smoke. But it was the far wall that caught Vertigo's attention and made his breath catch in his throat. A massive hole had been blasted through the reinforced concrete, opening into what appeared to be another detention area, one that dwarfed the section where they'd found their dozen captives. Row upon row of empty cages stretched into the darkness beyond, a testament to the true scope of Yolanda's operation.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NGE2ZDllNzA4NDQ2NjU5ZDkxZmY2Y2RiNDdiZmVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">"There were more," he said, his voice hollow. "Many more."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YmZlNTRmNWVlYzRkNzZiNjg0M2ExNzQ3ZjE1ZTAz"><span style="font-weight: 400">"At least thirty cages," Argent confirmed grimly. "All empty by the time I reached them. They must have been moved out when the alarm went off."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNmM3NGVlNTZhMzRhODBhYmM2MmM3YTBjOGQzMTA4"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Thirty more people," Kaelan said quietly, and Vertigo could hear the soft anguish in her voice. "We were too late."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYmU1NTEwOTRlNzRiMDliODQ3ZjhhYjc4NzdkNTRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">"No," Mara said firmly, moving to stand beside them as they stared into the empty detention area. "You saved the ones you could. And you gave us the chance to do this." She gestured to the devastation around them with savage satisfaction.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZmU5YTZhZDJmNDRlZDk4YzkxNTI4NTJhOWZjZjM2"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Do what?" Vertigo asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMmQxNDMzNGU4ODQzYWNhYWQzZDQ0ZTE3OGJmOWJj"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Burn it all down," she replied with a vicious smile. "When your young friend here found us after the collapse, we were already organizing. Some of us had been here long enough to know the layout, to understand how the operation worked. We used the chaos from the tunnel explosion to destroy everything we could find."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMTQ4Y2Y5YjYxZjRiYTk4NWJlYzgxY2QzYjM5YjVm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Argent nodded toward a section of the storage area where file cabinets had been overturned, their contents spilling across the floor in a sea of paper. "Records," she explained, kneeling to gather several intact folders. "Names, destinations, financial records. Everything they needed to track their human merchandise."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ODM5MmU2ODkxMDQ0MzY5ZjZjMTczNTk1OGY0ZmIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaelan took the offered documents, her expression growing increasingly thoughtful as she flipped through the pages. "This is their entire operation," she breathed. "Not just here in Etienne, but everywhere. Shipping routes, buyer contacts, corrupt officials..."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YTlhOTBkYmEzYzRjOGI5NGI4ZTE0ODhmYjViMDBm"><span style="font-weight: 400">"A complete network," Vertigo said, reading over her shoulder. "Names, dates, locations... everything we'd need to dismantle Yolanda's slave trade piece by piece."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZDExMmEyNWRjOTRiODc5ODdmNjIzY2EyZjViN2Ew"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mara's smile was sharp as a blade. "They kept very detailed records. Professional to the end."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OGM1YmE1OGI0NzQ5YzNhZDMwMWI4YTQyYzE2OTcy"><span style="font-weight: 400">"The fires?" Kaelan asked, noting the smoke still rising from several areas.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NTE2OTI1NjYzYjRkMTU5NzYyMjRiZjc0YmNhMjIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Insurance," Mara replied. "By morning, there won't be anything left but ash and rubble." As if to emphasize her words, another section of the building chose that moment to collapse, sending up a shower of sparks and debris. "We made sure of that."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNzUyMjQwY2JmOTRlMzc4MDYxZmExMzNkMTg0YjI0"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Time to go," Kaelan said decisively. "This place is coming down whether we're in it or not."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NzVkOTQ4NWNlMjQ4NTJiNmQ5Njc5MWIxNTNkZmJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">They made their way out through the maintenance passages, moving quickly but carefully through the maze of corridors and emergency exits. Behind them, the fires continued to spread, painting the night sky with an orange glow. Rain fell steadily, washing the dust and smoke from their faces and clothes. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1N2U3NWY3MzY5NjRkYTFhNzU1NjM3ZGI2ZGFjNjVk"><span style="font-weight: 400">The abandoned mill appeared through the rain, warm light spilling from its windows and the sound of quiet voices carrying on the night air. As they approached, a small figure detached itself from the group waiting by the entrance and ran toward them. "Vertigo!" Dai's voice cracked as he threw himself at Vertigo's legs, small arms wrapping around him with desperate strength. "I thought you were dead! I thought the rocks got you!"</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYWRhMmE5M2U1ODRkOWNhZTI3NTJjYzAxMDU5N2U5"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Hey, kid," Vertigo said softly, dropping to one knee so he could look Dai in the eye. The boy's face was streaked with tears and dirt, but his ice-blue eyes blazed with fierce loyalty. "Takes more than a little falling rock to keep me down."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZWYzYjBjYjQ3MjQ2ZjA4NTMwOWNhY2FlOWMwZGJh"><span style="font-weight: 400">"I was scared," Dai admitted, the confession clearly difficult for someone trying so hard to be brave. "But Mara said you'd come back. She said you promised."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTg4ZmVjNjI2MzQyMGZiZDMzNGUxZmVhYzc1MTk2"><span style="font-weight: 400">"I did promise," Vertigo confirmed, placing a gentle hand on the boy's shoulder. "And I keep my promises. All of them." He looked past Dai to where the other rescued captives waited, their faces reflecting mixtures of gratitude, hope, and lingering fear. "Are you all okay? Anyone hurt?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMyM2M3MTcyNDU4YjQ2MzVhNTk5OGVlZjI2OGYwMTE0"><span style="font-weight: 400">"We're fine," Mara answered for the group. "Thanks to all of you. We owe you our lives."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0N2ZjMzVhYTY5NzQ2MDViNzlmNDAwN2RkZTIxMTIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">"You owe us nothing," Kaelan replied with quiet authority.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MTlhM2FhZjUyODRlN2M4NjFjMDM3ZmQ2NDQ4NTVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Stay alive," Vertigo told her. "Keep these kids safe. Teach them to control their abilities."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNTIzNDYzYjdjNTQyMjJiMjAwYTVmMTA2ZmMzZDA1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mara nodded solemnly. "We will."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MWRkNjQ2MDg3MzQ3YzViYzVmYTY2ZGQ1ZTQ4YWNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">"What happens now?" asked one of the other captives, a teenage girl whose eyes held the same premature wisdom Vertigo had seen in Dai.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwM2NiNzg2MmRmZDQwNjY4YjdmZjE3NjZiMjFhMjMz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo looked to Kaelan, who was studying the group with thoughtful assessment. "You need to get somewhere safe," she said finally. "The settlements to the south might take you in."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMDg4OWRhNmQ0MzRmYjlhMWZmZDU0ZjE1YzI4ZDU2"><span style="font-weight: 400">"If Yolanda has connections there..."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNDdiY2EzODgzMTRkYzFhNmFhMWQzM2M1YjVlOGY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">"We don't have many options," she cut him off. "They need medical attention, food, proper shelter."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZDI2N2I4OTY2YzQ3MTZhNDZlYmY0N2Y4MGRkOTA3"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Speaking of medical attention..." Argent held up a large canvas bag that looked like it had been through a war. "Antibiotics, painkillers, surgical supplies. Everything that was reported stolen from the western settlements."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MTllZjJhNjUzMDQ2ZDM5MjYzZjEzNGFkOTMyNzYw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Relief flooded through Vertigo. "You got it."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMjU3NjRkZmZmYTQ5MDY4MzBmZjY4Mzg4ZGVlNGIy"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Barely." Argent's expression was grim. "They were moving everything out when I arrived. Another hour and it would have been gone."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwM2IxZWZiMjRiNTQxYWFiY2YzYzE2YWJiMzdkZThj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaelan immediately took charge of the medical supplies, ushering everyone inside and beginning to treat the most badly injured captives. Argent joined Vertigo at his watch post outside the door, her indigo eyes serious in her pale face.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDI5ODk4OTM3MzRmNTI5YjJkZDIxOWFmOWUwMjgx"><span style="font-weight: 400">"That will slow them down, but not for long," she said quietly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MGIwZDMwOTA2ZjQ3MmM4ZTBkZGVkMjZiYzhmYzAw"><span style="font-weight: 400">"They won't leave those Talents untraced," Vertigo agreed. "Especially the children. We need to get them out of here."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNzNlY2M4YWRhMjQzOGRhMmJjOGM3NTQ0MTNiMzQ2"><span style="font-weight: 400">"And then what?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM0Y2M4NmYxNGMwYjRjZjJiZTVjNzIwNTNlNTE1NTlh"><span style="font-weight: 400">The question hung between them like a challenge. "One battle at a time," Vertigo replied, the words feeling hollow even as he spoke them.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMzcwNTgyNDdjYTRhYzZhNWYxOWM1NmViN2ZlMmRl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaelan had finished treating the worst injuries and distributing food from their limited supplies. The captives ate ravenously, color returning to pale faces as hope began to replace fear. "They'll need escorts to the southern settlements," she said, joining them at the door. "At least two days' journey through difficult terrain."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YjJmNDA5M2U3YTQxMWFiODQ4NGJkN2M4ZTg1M2Zh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What,” Vertigo asked, unable to keep the venom from his voice, “you’re not going to try to kill them for being… what they are?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0MzQ0ZmJmOTc3ZTRjOWY4ZDEwYzM2MTcxZDY0NjZm"><span style="font-weight: 400">She was silent for a long minute, something warring behind her eyes. “Not today,” she said finally.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNTQ0MjkxZmQ5NjQ3NDhiNTgwYjBkY2I4MTI0M2Fi"><span style="font-weight: 400">"I'll go," Argent said with surprising firmness. "I can't leave them unprotected. Not after seeing what nearly happened to them."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYjk3NTEyODNmZjRiZmZiZjJkYWY0YWU1M2UzNWQ2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo opened his mouth to argue when a sudden, brilliant light illuminated the entire clearing. He tensed, hand moving to his sword, but Kaelan's reaction was even more alarming. She went rigid, a hiss escaping her. "Get inside," she ordered, her voice tight with something that might have been fear. "Now."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTI5ODc3YjdjYzRiMzY4NTA2NDg2ODNiYmQ5MWEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Argent's expression turned grim. "Too late," she murmured.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOTdlNWRjNTllNzQ3YjlhOGYxNjBjMTIxNzc1MjA5"><span style="font-weight: 400">A figure descended from the sky, outlined in light so bright it hurt to look at directly. Brilliant golden wings spread wide as the newcomer touched down gracefully on the wet earth, touching down with the kind of theatrical flair that spoke of someone who enjoyed making an entrance.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZDRkZTI4NjYwNDQ5MDNiYjAyNzJiYTI5NTY1ZDA1"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Kaelan," the figure called, her voice melodic but cold. "Imagine finding you here, consorting with half-breeds and protecting demon-spawn."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNGY3MGNlYTgyNTRlOWZhOWEzNWNhYjcyYTQ3NmE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Jaeli, the blue-haired angel, stood before them in radiant glory. Her golden spear glittered in the rain, its tip pointed directly at Argent. "I've been searching for you, fledgling," she purred.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NzlkNjBlMTliMjQyZDZhZWY4OGQ0YjAwZGNjMjU5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Argent stepped forward, her small frame suddenly radiating defiance. "You have what you wanted. Leave me alone."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1N2E5MzQ1MTI4NzQ2Yjk5NzMzZTQwMWQ2N2Q5MGM5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Jaeli's smile was predatory, all sharp edges and cruel amusement. "We can't have you telling tales, now can we?" Her eyes shifted to Kaelan, taking in the scene with obvious distaste. "And you. Helping a deserter, interfering with demonic affairs. The Council will be fascinated to hear your explanation."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNzljNzczM2FkYzRiNzg4MTdhNGVhZWFiM2MxNzc4"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Leave her out of this," Argent demanded, her voice stronger than Vertigo had ever heard it. "This is between you and me."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZjM2Y2Y2ZDcwYTRiMThiNWVhNjdiM2QzNjEwZGJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">The air around them grew heavier as tension built, power crackling between the angels. Raindrops seemed to slow in their descent, caught in the field of power emanating from the confrontation.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDE3MzRjMGM4ZDQ1MzdhNjRhYzBjZTE3YzcyMmU0"><span style="font-weight: 400">"No," Jaeli said simply. "It's far beyond that now. Come quietly, or I'll take you by force."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Yjc3NzNmNmRiOTRiYmQ4ODNiMTgyYWQzNGRkODc4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Argent squared her shoulders, her indigo eyes meeting Jaeli's golden ones without flinching. For a moment, she looked exactly like what she was: an angel of storms, terrible and beautiful and utterly unafraid.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YWYzZmJmNzEyOTQ1YjJhOTk5NDc5ODRjMjZhNTNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">"You can try," she said.</span></p>
