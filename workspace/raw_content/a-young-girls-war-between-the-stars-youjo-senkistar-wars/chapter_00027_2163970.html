<p class="cnM1M2QxZjgyYjhiNjQ0ZGQ4MTEzNzlmMTAyOWVmMTFl" style="margin-bottom: 0">I sighed as I stepped out of the amazingly hot, water-based shower in Ramil’s former estate, which Master Dooku’s sister Jenza had given to us to stay in until we were ready to leave. Moving over to my bed, letting my towel fall to the ground along the way, I grabbed the red silk robe laid out there pulled it on.</p>

<p class="cnNlMzI0YjA0YTBlYTQ4MDBiZGYzNGY4NmYxNTQ1MTBh" style="margin-bottom: 0">Sighing, I flopped back onto the sinfully soft, fluffy bed and closed my eyes. Supper would be served soon so I couldn’t fall asleep, but a light nap and some meditation wouldn’t hurt—</p>

<p class="cnNjZjk1ZTg4ZGFmYTRiZDg5MDI0Y2YxMDQ2ZDZjMzI3" style="margin-bottom: 0">A knock sounded at my door and I frowned, reaching out to feel the person on the other side. Raising an eyebrow when I found it was Master Dyas, I stood and made my way to the door. The man smiled down at me as I opened it. He had the hood on his cloak up and glanced back down the hall. It was at this point that I realized that this was the first time I’d seen him since I left him on top of that tank to go after the dragon.</p>

<p class="cnM5OTY1YTMzMjU0NTQxMzliZjJmNTMxYmMzYzM2NDk0" style="margin-bottom: 0">I shook my head and moved aside, letting him in and closing the door. I retook my seat on the bed as he pulled out a chair from beneath a writing desk in the corner and sat down straddling it backwards, before pulling his hood back.</p>
<p class="cnM5MDJhOGYxODE2MjRmMDE5MGU0YTBlMDMyYTliMzQ0" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNkNTEyNTkyMTY1NTQ5YTViNWJhZTNlY2FmYWJiZWYy" style="margin-bottom: 0">Studying him for a moment, I finally said, “You disappeared after the battle. The Mandos sent to report in said you were gone.”</p>

<p class="cnNiOGZmNDNiNzIxMzRkYmY4ZTM3ZTRjZWEwNDUxYjYz" style="margin-bottom: 0">He winced, nodding even as he grinned. “Ah, yeah, <em>about that…</em><span style="font-style: normal"> Could you do me a favor?”</span></p>

<p class="cnNiZGZlMzM2NmJmNTRjNzdhOGFiMWNhMGI1MjRiOTU0" style="margin-bottom: 0">Master Dyas chuckled, asking, “Not gonna ask what I want first?”</p>

<p class="cnNkMGE2MWE3NmYxMjQ4MmM5ZTg3ZDkxYzk0ZTRjNTgw" style="margin-bottom: 0">“You are a Master in good standing. You’ve also treated me fairly and done much to help me since I joined the Order. I’m certainly curious, but sure you would not ask me to do anything you didn’t feel was necessary.”</p>
<p class="cnMwMGYyZjNkMDkwMjRiMGRhZTM3ZTU4YzA0ZGVmNDhk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMzZjVjOWQ4YjhkYzQyZTNhNzJiMzkzZWE4ZDRiOTE5" style="margin-bottom: 0">Master Dyas nodded. “We both know a war is coming.” I nodded in agreement, and after a moment, he continued. “I’ve made some arrangements to secure troops and supplies for the war. But for this to work, <em>it can’t leak</em><span style="font-style: normal">.”</span></p>

In a day or two, when they’re sorting through the wreckage, they’ll discover the crushed remains of my body alongside several others. Utterly unidentifiable, of course—except for my robe and my lightsaber. Neither you nor the other Jedi on planet have seen me, until now. When the body is discovered, I need </span><em>you</em><span style="font-style: normal"> to confirm that you think you felt my death in the Force, when the dragon attacked. You’ll put that in your report and, if questioned by the council, that’s the story. </span><span style="font-style: normal">As far as you know,</span><span style="font-style: normal"> I died in battle.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZDc0N2VhZDFlOTQ0MmFhZmFjZjA4Y2EyMzZlZGZh" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNiMjI3MzlhNzA2ZjQwMGNhMGY2ZjUwZDMyM2FmMmNl" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<span style="font-style: normal">Very well,” I nodded, before sending him a smile. “Your loss is a blow to us all.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhM2IzNjYyOGFjNjQ0NmZiMDZmYjI2Y2ZjNGIwZDEz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNiM2IzOGQxZDRjMDQ3ZDJiMzNjODQ3NGJjMTM1NmQ5" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Haha. Thanks. That’s just the first part, though.”</p>

<p class="cnNhOTBmOGQxNzNmMDRiNDNhNTMyNjVkNTgyMzRkODQ1" style="margin-bottom: 0">“There’s more?”</p>

<p class="cnNlNWY4OTY4OWE4MTQ4ZmZhZjYyOTAwNGM4OTQ1YmVi" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Yes. You’ll be returning to Coruscant with the others to give the Council your report. When you get there, I need you to visit the archives. There’s a planet there that I’d like you to remove. The planet Kamino, in the Kamino System, in the Abrion sector. If you can, it’d help if you could get in and wipe it from the galactic mapping system too. I seem to recall you had some experience with that recently,” he grinned.</p>
<p class="cnNkMmQ4YjJkNGU1NzQ3Njc4OTFhNjZjMmI0MmE2NGZj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMzMTQwZDU4ZjRlMjRjODFiMjQzMjdhNTkyZjJjMGVl" style="margin-bottom: 0">“I know who to talk to to get it done as a favor,” I confirmed.</p>
<p class="cnM3MjEzMjhlZTlmMDRjZWNhNjg5YzBmYzI5ZThiODdi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMwNTIxMTdlMzg0YjQ2NzdiZDVjODVmM2M0NWMzMTc4" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Good. That’s good. There shouldn’t be any trace of the money in their systems and everything I borrowed should be back in place by the time I withdraw what I’ve made. I’ll send your share to your personal account and you can do as you like with it.” Considering for a moment, he nodded. “I believe that’s everything.”</p>
<p class="cnMzMTkyNjE0OTg4NTQ0N2I5MGU2OTRlMDY3YTkyNDA5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNmNzRjZmYyMzk0NzQ0NmRiZGFjMzRmODQzN2MzMjRl" style="margin-bottom: 0">I nodded as Master Dyas stood, joining him as he headed for the door. Holding out a hand, I pulled one of my lightsabers over and snagged it out of the air, before offering it to him. “If you’re giving yours up, you shouldn’t travel without one.”</p>
<p class="cnM4ZTJjYzQ1ODNiNzQyYTU4YmE3NjY5ZDlhZDQ4NWU2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNhOTNmNzRmMTk5ZDQyZjRhZGVhZDUzMWJhYmZmNDNi" style="margin-bottom: 0">Master Dyas chuckled, shaking his head. “Thanks. I appreciate the offer, but one of the things you learn after being a Jedi for a while is to always make a spare and keep it hidden away in case of emergencies.” Reaching down, he patted my shoulder. “Take care, Tanya.”</p>
<p class="cnM1OTEyZmQzOTY4NDQ2NjFiNTNkOWQyM2Y1M2U5NTAz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMyMGQxY2EyZDUyMzRiMTdhNmE2YWQ0YjllYTNiMDgw" style="margin-bottom: 0">“You as well, Master Dyas,” I nodded, and the man turned and left, closing the door silently behind himself. I sent the lightsaber back to the shelf and grabbed my computer off the desk table, since I’d been reminded of the need. Sitting on the bed, I began working up my report for the events of Serenno…</p>
<hr/>
<p class="cnNlN2FkNjI1ZDg2MjQ3ZTA4ZDM5MzE5YmY2MzgzOTkz" style="margin-bottom: 0">With Ramil’s mercenaries defeated and having fled, his droid army destroyed, and the man himself dead at the hands of some well-meaning but perhaps a bit over-zealous soldier who shall remain entirely nameless, that didn’t mean things went back to normal immediately.</p>
<p class="cnM5Yzk5YzVlYmU1YzRmZGZhZTFmY2U2OGJiZDVlOGEy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNhYjFmMWVlZmVlMzRiNjJiOWI0Mzg2ZGNjMTA5NDRk" style="margin-bottom: 0">Jenza’s government took control and began the process of getting everything back on track. That included finding and freeing those remaining people who had been taken as hostages who had just been left abandoned by the Abyssins in accommodations little better than a prison. All of the people who had been conscripted against their will were offered amnesty and allowed to return home to their families, to many teary-eyed reunions.</p>
<p class="cnMyNTU5NzNjODkzNzQ0ZThiNDgxNDI5MzliYmJjZDRl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNhOTQ1NWFkMGJkODQyOGM4MjdhMmI2YjY0ZjAyZGJk" style="margin-bottom: 0">Of course,<em> someone</em><span style="font-style: normal"> had to vet that there weren’t a bunch of volunteers, sympathizers, quislings, and true believers of Ramil’s cause trying to hide out among the conscripts. There were a lot of them, but thankfully, the process to get them screened was simple, and we had f</span><span style="font-style: normal">our</span><span style="font-style: normal">—technically </span><span style="font-style: normal">five</span><span style="font-style: normal">, but Master Dooku was occupied—people who could easily discern truth from lies among our number. We got the process down to a simple Q&amp;A session, with </span><span style="font-style: normal">three</span><span style="font-style: normal"> questions. </span><span style="font-style: normal">After that, it was just a matter of moving them through quickly. </span><span style="font-style: normal">G</span><span style="font-style: normal">oing eight hours a day, accounting for delays and dealing with the occasional traitor, we were able to do about nine hundred per day.</span></p>

<p class="cnM0MmMwYTUxMzVhOTRjNGM4NmY1NjkxNDI1ZjU3YWRm" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">While we handled that particular problem at Master Dooku’s request, the older man spent his time with his sister and occasionally Satine and Jaster, talking politics. I wasn’t privy to those discussions, nor did I particularly care to be. I didn’t really need to know their plans for rebuilding Serenno unless I was going to be involved somehow.</p>
<p class="cnNlYmZkYTQxNzY4YjQzMDI4M2NiMTI0OTI4OTJkYWI1" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMzMjFiNTU2Yjc3ZjRjMmFhMmRlYWI2OTA3Y2U4YmE5" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal">Jango and the other Mandos spent their time scavenging all of the leftover gear from both the Abyssins and the droid army they could. I’d even heard some talk that they were working on stripping down the dragon and removing its hide to cure to use as leather parts in their armor—specifically, for the under layer to mount it on, if anyone wanted it. It was plasma resistant, though not to the same degree as beskar, but it was still better than most of the stuff they wore under their armor. </span><span style="font-style: normal">I’d put in my own request for some, since I couldn’t actually get out and go harvest it myself. I could see the potential uses for it and I’d like to have materials on hand when I stopped growing eventually.</span></p>

<p class="cnNmYWNhZGYwYmRkYTQ3MDY4MDQ3ZjI1NmU5MDIxMjY1" style="margin-bottom: 0">Also… being able to say I had a dragon hide jacket or something would be very cool.</p>

<p class="cnMxYzlhMTQxOTkxOTQyNjc5NWFkODYyMzdlMGZkMjli" style="margin-bottom: 0">When I wasn’t working to help screen the amnesty candidates for traitors, I spent most of my time either practicing or meditating. For some reason, Master Kostana had taken an interest in me. Though, that may have had something to do with Master Dyas and his ‘death.’</p>
<p class="cnMzOGM2MDY4ZmIyNDQxMGQ4YThkN2IwYjE3Y2QxOTA1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNlZjM2NDc2Nzg2NzQ2OTNiNGJhOTc2NDk1MjJjY2Nh" style="margin-bottom: 0">Two days after my secret meeting with him, the Mandos found Master Dyas’s body, just as he said they would—or at least, the body he had staged and left behind. The funeral was a short affair, held at night. What was left of the body was wrapped in cloth and burned on a funeral pyre. Somehow, his lightsaber crystal found its way from Master Kostana into my hands since the saber itself was crushed and damaged beyond repair and, unwilling to turn it down and appear suspicious since the man was a friend, I accepted.</p>
<p class="cnM4YzcxODNiMTRmMTQ2NTVhMjQ1ZWJiZmUwNDBlZDlm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMxYzYzODFkOTBhOTRiMzc5ODdhMGU4M2I0NDBhZDQz" style="margin-bottom: 0">Ever since then, Master Kostana had been… I wanted to say training me, but it would be more accurate to call it <em>testing me</em><span style="font-style: normal">. I was a puzzle and, as I’d found with so many other Jedi Masters, that </span><em>bothered</em><span style="font-style: normal"> them in a way that they couldn’t just leave alone. They had to poke, prod, and pick away until they saw what was inside and if I didn’t immediately fold to their testing, they seemed to take that as either a challenge, an affront to their authority, or something to be </span><em>deeply concerned</em><span style="font-style: normal"> about—at least, from what I had learned from my interactions with the High Council to date.</span></p>

It’s an emotion that is neither positive nor negative but can be used for either. In tapping into that emotion, you were able to stop a threat that could have gone on to end countless lives. That’s objectively a good thing. In the heat of the moment, you were driven to confront the thing making you afraid. Now, imagine that sort of power used for another purpose. Under other conditions. Suppose you get older and want to start a family of your own. You have a child yourself. Something happens, it doesn’t even have to be foul play—but something happens and your child dies. Overcome with grief and loss, you lash out with the Force and before you know it, you’ve smashed the town you called home to pieces and killed or injured everyone there. Your enjoyment of that attachment has led to a much greater suffering in the world around you, greater than all the good that was or might have come from it.

Finding the metal crate, I picked it up with the Force and made my way below deck. Setting it on the floor, I opened it up and paused as I spotted my armor laying on top, along with two pieces I hadn’t commissioned, and a data disk. The chest piece had been modified, adding a raised section in the middle that looked like a skull—a skull with four horns and four eye holes.</p>

The other pieces were a pair of pauldrons sized such that it should fit for several years without being so big as to look ridiculous right now or so small to be useless when I got older. One of them bore the same skull as the chest piece. That one, I attached to my robe, on the right shoulder. The other bore the same Mythosaur skull based insignia as Jaster’s armor and went on the left shoulder. Both of them, like my chest piece, were bare—neither painted nor chromed, instead having the natural gray pattern of beskar.</p>

She needed to know <em>why</em><span style="font-style: normal"> I was apologizing, because I didn’t want to start some cycle of every time I did something she didn’t like, she sulked until she got me to admit fault.

<p class="cnMxN2UwOGRjZGUyNjQ2MGI5YmZjMGI0OWRmNWEyZmQ2" style="margin-bottom: 0">Nodding, she murmured, “I shouldn’t have stayed angry at you. I should have just let it go.”</p>

<p class="cnM2MjIyYzUxMGEyMzQyZmQ4MzYwNGY2YzU2MjE3YmRm" style="margin-bottom: 0">I considered my response for a moment. Remembering Master Qui-Gon’s words, I chuckled quietly. “Live and learn.”</p>

<p class="cnMwOTViOTY2NjdhODRhNTlhZDNiNDkyZTZmMGUzZDI0" style="margin-bottom: 0">We fell silent after that and, by unspoken agreement, began our meditation. I pulled my computation orb out and rested it in my lap, once more tracing the paths within it and filling out what I felt like I needed to, working with the Force to expand the intricate inscriptions within.</p>

<p class="cnM0NTEzZDNmMzgxZDQwNzU4MThhZDA2ZTQ0NWRjZWU2" style="margin-bottom: 0">The days of travel were filled with finishing out my report on the events that transpired between Mandalore and Serenno, shared meditation, the occasional bit of light sparring, in addition to conversation and shared time with Obi. Her emotions were once more threatening to drive me up the wall, but this time, they weren’t directed at me. She was sad that she had to part ways with Satine for now and likely wouldn’t see her any time soon. And while understandable… after the second night of <em>sad Obi</em><span style="font-style: normal">, I sat her down and had a talk with her, trying to impart the lesson Master Qui-Gon had given me to think on. </span></p>

<p class="cnMwZDY4MzhjMDNlYzRiYTViYTc1NWQ3ODAzOTA3OTUw" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">That was easier said than done, unfortunately. So instead, I kept her as distracted as I could and tried to wear her out before bed with physical exercise, so she would fall into a mostly dreamless sleep.</p>

<p class="cnMzNDZlNjM3ZmM1NTQ0YzhhYTM3MDFlNjcyMjEyZDEz" style="margin-bottom: 0">With all the time to meditate and work on my computation orb, I was starting to feel like I was finally making real progress on it now that I’d passed the first big hurdle of getting it to store and fix the Force and allow me to tap into it. Only… a few hundred more steps to go? I wasn’t entirely sure. It didn’t feel done. Perhaps a quarter of the way to being complete, more or less.</p>

<p class="cnMxZTI3MmU3NmE2NzQ4OTM4NGY2ZWM3MzJhMTM3NGNk" style="margin-bottom: 0">One night, after our exercise and getting cleaned up, Obi came across the data disk I’d found with my armor and held it up, wagging it in the air. “What’s this?”</p>

<p class="cnNiMTg4YTk2YzAyOTQwMTZiYWIxNTRiZjlhNDcyYzVj" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Hm?” I asked, looking it over, before remembering where it had come from. “I found it in the box with my armor and materials. I have no idea what’s on it.”</p>

<p class="cnNlZTVhZTEwZmUwZDQzODc4YTg3MjI4NTU0ODE3MzMw" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Let’s find out!” the girl grinned, making her way over to the holo projector and popping it in. We grabbed a pair of seats and sat down as it started to play out.</p>

<p class="cnMyNzY0NmEwMzE4NDQzMWY5ODc0NDNkZmI4OTFiYzZh" style="margin-bottom: 0">It took a moment, but I recognized the scene eventually as I spotted Tor Vizsla standing in front of a holocom, and then myself being led into frame by Bo-Katan Kryze.

<p class="cnM2N2E1N2E3MjE0NTRiY2ZhOGY3MTVkNmUzNmIwNzA5" style="margin-bottom: 0">In the hologram, we watched as I cut my way out of my cuffs with a mage blade. The next several minutes were a high speed montage of pieced together footage from thirty or so different angles of the battle between me and the Death Watch. Each kill was shown from multiple angles, including the one that did them in if it was there. It all culminated in my showdown with the man himself.</p>
