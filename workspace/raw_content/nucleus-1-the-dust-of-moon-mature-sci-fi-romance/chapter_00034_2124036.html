<p class="cnNmZmRjZDdhOWNlYjRlZDQ5ZWQ3YzY5ZWRhOGM4NjYy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><strong>13:55, February 28, 2284</strong></span></p>
<p class="cnM3MjEzMjU1NzRmMjQ5Y2U4ZGEzMGY4ODc0NzdkNjZl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Oslo Starport, Terminal 8, Gate 5C, Oslo, Norway, Nordic Commonwealth territory</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYTEyOWJlN2U5NzQ3ZWU4NWJjNGE2MzNhMGFlMDJl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><strong>C</strong>haos filled Terminal 8 as Sigrún and Harald burst through the maintenance tunnel's exit. Emergency lights cast an eerie red glow across the sea of faces – families clutching children, elderly couples supporting each other, students like herself with terror in their eyes.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MWI0NDYyMmIyZjRmMzBhMzhhZWExYjNlNjNmY2M1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Pappa, look!" Sigrún pointed to the departure board, its display flickering. Most flights showed 'CANCELLED' in red letters, but a few still blinked with 'BOARDING' status. Her heart leaped when she spotted one: Flight OS-2284 to Copenhagen.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MWRhMTc0Y2U0YjQ3NmNiZTA0NGQyNGQxNTc2ODQ0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Through the terminal's vast windows, she could see the silhouettes of defunct fusion reactors in the distance, their cooling towers dark against the grey February sky. A group of refugees huddled near the window.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjlmNzFjZjJiNjRkZTZiYzU2NTZlYWJjM2IyN2Q1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Der har vi det," Harald muttered as he guided them through the crowd. "Copenhagen first, then we can arrange transport to—"</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNjFlZWJhNmFkMzQzMmJhNjQxNzllYTJkYTQzMTA4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A bone-chilling screech cut through the air. Dark shapes wheeled against the sky, their wings casting strange shadows over the cracked solar panels that lined the terminal's roof. The creatures they'd fled from in the city had followed them here.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNjkyODI4NmI5YjQxZjM5NTc3YTJjOGNmYzRiMzYx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"They're spreading faster than I anticipated," Harald said, his voice tight with worry. "The entire eastern corridor may already be lost."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YzU1MDU5MDczYzRkYzBiZGZhMjZmOGZjMjJlZWNh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Near the currency exchange booth, a digital billboard cycled through old advertisements – luxury cruises to the Realm of Divines, terraform tours of Venus, private shuttles to Osram. The prices still displayed in Norwegian Krone, though most transactions now required Atomic Dollars or Imperial Yuan. A reminder of their nation's waning influence.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NWY5NzUxYzM1MzQ1M2M5NGQ4ZWY4ZjRiY2ViZjYy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Military personnel and security officers formed a barrier near the main entrances, their weapons trained on the doors. Many wore mismatched gear – some in standard Nordic Commonwealth gray, others in borrowed Alliance blue. Through gaps in the crowd, Sigrún saw bodies strewn across the floor – both human and those monstrous things. Blood smeared the polished tiles, some of it seeping into cracks where maintenance had been neglected.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNDIzNjY1ODcyMjQ3NDFiNDRjMWQ4MGI5YWY0MTY1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Draugs." Harald's grip on her hand tightened. "Humans infected with the Nucleus Virus."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Y2NiYmZiYjFlMTRlYmNhNTBhMDk5OWQ2MGM5Y2Fi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"What's this virus do, Pappa?" she asked as they passed by the scene, the metallic scent mingling with fear and sweat.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MzViNTExOGIyODQ3MzhiMzg1MzJkMWY4ZjI0ZmI3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Too much to describe," he shook his head, leading her past a shuttered café where a sign apologized for closure due to "supply chain issues."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTQ2ZjUxMTU1ZjQ2NThhMmI0ODUxMWE3NDIzNDJj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">They pressed forward through the crowd, Harald's presence creating a small bubble of calm in the chaos. His other hand remained raised, ready to cast protective spells if needed. The Pendant of Mánagrát felt warm against Sigrún's chest, its blue jewel pulsing faintly with each step.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhN2ZhMGZjYzkyZjRlYjU5ODRiZjA4NGUyZWU5ZmRl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A woman's scream pierced the air. One of the bat-like creatures had smashed through a window near Gate 3, showering the crowd with glass. The window's anti-breach forcefield flickered weakly before dying completely. As people scrambled away, Sigrún saw the creature clearly for the first time – leather-like wings stretched between elongated fingers, eyeless head swiveling as it searched for prey.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYjA5NjFjNjllMDQ5ZDY4ZDIwZWQxOWQ5N2ExZTI1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Himmel og helvete," she whispered, frozen in place.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOTQ1MzNjN2VlMTRlM2I5OTE2ZDdjOGVkMzEwZWFm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Harald pushed her behind him, his voice rising in the familiar cadence of spellcasting: "<em>Fulmen Argentum!</em>"</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MzBmNGRmMmVlNDRhZWFhZGRmOTMyM2E2MDYyN2M1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Silver lightning crackled from his hands, striking the creature. It shrieked and fell, its wing membrane smoking. But more shapes appeared at the broken window.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OGQ3NDgxN2U2NDQ2MmFiZjE2Y2U1MjNhZjhkY2Ux"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The gate, Synne! Run!"</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMWZkYjJhNzlmOTQ3NjU4MDQ3OTFmNTUzNmZhNDM0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">They sprinted toward Gate 5C, where harried flight crew were trying to maintain order as passengers crowded the boarding bridge. A security officer stood at the checkpoint, his rifle trained on the windows.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZjI3ZTA4NWZmNDRjMDBiZGU0MmVjNzFlODdlYjgy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As they approached the gate, a familiar voice called out from behind.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MDMwNDAxNmMyNTQ1NzA5OGMxZThkZTYzZGUzZmEx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Professor Omdal! Sigrún!"</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OTM5NTYzNzMzODRjMGE5MmMyNzhlNDVhYzU0MTlm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">They turned to see a tall young man staggering toward them. Sigrún's breath caught in her throat.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZjcxMWFhMDExYzQwM2JhNGM0ZDEzODk5NWNkZmU3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Sven?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MDFlZDU5YTAxNzQyZTNiNzM2ZGFhNjdhYmZlNzEx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Sven Solheim had been her classmate, her first lover, her future husband according to their friends. But the Sven before her now was hardly recognizable. His handsome face was contorted, skin mottled with patches of brown scales. His right arm had lengthened unnaturally, fingers fused into what looked like talons. And from his back, two bulbous protrusions pulsed beneath his torn sweater – the beginning of something that wasn't human.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZTRkZDJkOGRhYzQzZjA4ODdjOWU0ZWFiOGUxZTJk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"What have you done, Sven?" Harald's voice was cold steel.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ODljMWFiYjYyODRjNTFiMDI4NWVhMTA2MWM1MDU3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"What you refused to do, Professor," Sven replied, his voice oscillating between his normal timbre and something deeper, almost guttural. "Saving our people."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMGY4YzA5MWVjZTQ4M2NiZjBmMTAxOGFlMmM3OGFl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Harald stepped forward, positioning himself between Sven and Sigrún. "By becoming a Draug? Madness!"</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZWMyYmUwYzFmYjQxOTU5NzVhNGFhMjk1MmZjZGZh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Sven's laugh was hollow, edged with pain. "The Alliance, the Imperium, the Directorate – all treating our homeland like a playground! Dumping their Helionite in our waters, exploiting our people. Is it madness to retaliate? To protect our home?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZDM5ZWZlYjExZDRiNDY5NWVjOGI2MjEyNGFjYTMw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Through what, mass murder?" Harald challenged.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNTI1NTYxN2U2YjQ3MjY5NjgyZDUyMDliNmZlZGE3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Evolution," Sven corrected, his half-transformed face twisting into something resembling a smile. "The Nucleus Virus transforms. Elevates. With these Radi-Mons, we'll reclaim Scandinavia and build something stronger from the ashes."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNmNlMjM1NWQ3ZjQ4YTRhNDA2MjllNGY3Mzg1MTli"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Sigrún stepped forward, heart hammering against her ribs. "Sven, this isn't you…"</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMWFhZDVkZDcxYTQ0N2RiOWQ0MzQzNDI1NzNmNmQx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">His eyes – still blue, still human – found hers, softening momentarily. "Sigrún," he said, her name almost a prayer on his lips. "I did this for us. For all Nordlings! Come with me."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OGMyZWY4MjA1MDRmMzI5MjNhNTE5NzJiMmY1OWM3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You're killing innocent people," she said, her voice breaking. "Children, families…"</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ODIwNzE0MmJhMTQxOTBhNzI3ZWZkZjk5Yzc4ZWQ1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Casualties of rebirth." Sven replied, though guilt and regret flickered across his face. "Our people suffer as foreigners seek to erode our culture. It's time to awaken and fight back!"</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZDg1YzNlZTU2YTQ2MjRiNDhiMDFjNmZjNTgzNGMz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You've been speaking to the Hivemind, Sven," Harald interrupted, his hands already tracing the beginning of a spell.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYzQ0ZjgyMDcxMTRlYmNhMWRkNDc0ZGUzNzFiNmIx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Hivemind has given me a new identity. Seen my potential," Sven's expression hardened. He looked past Harald to Sigrún. "He sees yours too, Sigrún. I can smell it on you. The power in your bloodline." His nostrils flared as he inhaled deeply. "Like moonlight and frost."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMjNjY2E5MjIxNzRhODc4YTM0MWM4Zjk4YTZhYjZl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Harald's eyes widened in alarm. "Fears and resentments cloud your judgement, Sven. Now's not the time —"</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNjg3MDE5MmM3ZDRiMjM5ZmQ0NmMyMmZkYmM5NGQz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"From this day forward, I am Skarn!" Sven roared, the sound inhuman. The protrusions on his back burst through his clothing, revealing the beginning of tentacles, glistening with fluid. "Soon, my Fenris Horde shall claim the Crystal, and become the harbingers of salvation."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YmQ1MTE4Njc0NzQxMWFhOTBkYTUxMDU1Y2RkODgw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Sigrún flinched. "Crystal? What crystal?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZmNkODRmZDYyMTQ5ZDc5NzdiNjYxZGU2MjA3ZWQy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Secrets that could make us new masters of the Five Realms." Sven hissed. "Secrets we were meant to know."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MmI3ODc2ODAzODQ1Nzk5Mjg3NDM2OTliMTUxMWZi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Around them, the chaos in the terminal intensified. More windows shattered as those bat-like creatures forced their way in. From the main entrance, humanoid monstrosities resembling Sven's form – Draugs, Harald had called them – began to pour in, tearing through the defensive line of security personnel.</span></p><span class="cjIyZWVjOGQ0OTg5YTQ3NGI4NzgzNWM5MDgxYWFlZGNi"><br/>The narrative has been taken without permission. Report any sightings.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM3Mzg5N2YyYmE5YzRjNzlhZDVjNTRiNzRiMzI5Zjg5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Tickets!" the gate agent demanded as they approached. Her professional demeanor was cracking, fear evident in her trembling hands.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOTlkODQ4NGMwNzRhMWQ5Mjg5MzQyOWQ5Y2E0YjE1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Harald produced their documentation with remarkable calm. "Two for Copenhagen. Omdal, Harald and Fjeld, Sigrún."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyY2M3MzJmYWZjMzRmMmJhMmQwNWYwZDgwMGEwYzVj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The agent barely glanced at their credentials before waving them through. "Vær så god. Skynd dere!"</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYTY4MzVhYWFkOTRmZmNiMGFhZmI0OWE0MTYzZjhl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">They had almost reached the bridge when Sven's voice rang out again.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhM2EzMzZkMTEyMzRmODQ5ODIzMzYwN2ZiMjc2MzFm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"She stays with me, Professor!"</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YzllYThkNDRiYTQ5MTZiYThjZWJjNDlkZjJkOTFi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Sigrún turned to see Sven lunging toward them, his movement unnaturally fast. One of his emerging tentacles shot forward, whipping through the air toward her. Harald raised his hand, eyes narrowing in concentration.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNDZiMDY1OTI3ODQxNTk4ZjJkYTJhNWMxYjZjN2My"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"<em>Scutum Lunaris!</em>"</span></p>
<p class="cnM4N2JmNmVhNTQ1OTQyOGQ4NzkzZGQwZjYxOWFkZWVk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A silver barrier materialized between them and Sven, the tentacle bouncing off its surface with a sound like a cracking whip. Sven snarled, his face contorting further, less human with each passing second.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Y2JlYzVkYTk4NTQ5Nzk5NTE5NWZhMWZiMzliYWIy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"She belongs with her own kind," he growled. "Her true kind!"</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZTI4ODcyY2VjZDRlZTI4MDQ4NDJiMDBhNDM0ZDcw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Sigrún, board the plane," Harald said, his voice steady despite the strain of maintaining the barrier. "I'll be right behind you."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZTE5ZWZlMDdkZDRlYTRhZDVkZDIwODdhZTEzYmEy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"No, I'm not leaving without—"</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Yzc3NTg5ODQ3NzRlN2U4NTBkZjk0ZjBmNjhhM2Nh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Hør på meg!" His voice carried the sharp edge of command she rarely heard. "I need to buy you time."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OTI1NTlhZmY1MTQzYWZhZTgyZWQ0MDVjZjI0MTU0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A massive tentacle slammed against the barrier, causing ripples of silver light. Sven's partially transformed face appeared behind it, pressing close enough that Sigrún could see the remaining human parts of his features contort with desperation.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDg5YTdmOTQ5NjRmNGY5Njg0YjdlZDViZmFmYmZl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Sigrún!" Sven called out, his voice fluctuating between familiar and monstrous. "Don't let him send you away!" His human hand pressed against the barrier, fingers splayed. "Remember what we discussed in Advanced Psionics? About the potential sleeping in Nordic blood?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOGYzMzY3OWI1OTQzZWNhNTg0NDdiODA5MWE1ZTRm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Harald's hands were already moving in complex patterns as he spoke an incantation she didn't recognize: "<em>Scutum Lunaris Maximum!</em>"</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NDZiN2RjMjEyZjQ4NmZhZDM2MzZjNmIyNjg1MWQx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The barrier expanded, encompassing the entire boarding area. Sven slammed against it again, reality seeming to ripple where he struck. Two more tentacles emerged from his back, probing the barrier's edges for weaknesses.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMzdhM2M2ZmYxNTRmY2RiZjI3MDE1Y2M2NDJiMDZi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Ask your pa about Europa, Sigrún!" Sven called out, voice deepening to a rumble as his jaw extended. "Ask him about the Jokull! About what he's been breeding in those labs!" One tentacle found a weak spot, pressing through until Harald reinforced that section with another spell.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMzI1MDIzOGVlMzQ3NTU5NWNjN2I3NGQzOTgzMjdl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Pappa, what's he talking about?" Sigrún asked, confusion mixing with her fear.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMjE3N2JmMGNiYTRhZjY5Mjc1YmFiZGM1MjgyOTQw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Lies and half-truths!" Harald's face remained impassive, focused on maintaining the barrier. Sweat beaded on his forehead as Sven's assault intensified.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMjhmZjY2OWYxODRlZGM5ZTgzNTk4NjlmOGJhYTA2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">More Draugs were converging on their position now, their rotting flesh and jerky movements disturbing. Behind Sigrún, the gate agent was frantically urging the last passengers onto the plane.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYzRjNzhiMGE0ZjQzMTNhZjEzMmY1Yjc1YjhlNzgx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"He's protecting you from your destiny!" The blue of Sven's remaining human eye fixed on her while the other had already transformed into an ominous orange. "Alliance, Imperium, whichever! They all fears us, Sigrún. They'll never let us reach our full potential!"</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MGUwNTA2YmY3ZTQ3NzNhYmM4ZmNhNmZiMzBiOGNk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Pappa, please," she begged, tears stinging her eyes. "Come with me now."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYjRkYWE2OGEyZTQwNzBiZDRmZDkwOGEwN2JhNzIy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Harald turned to her, his face softening for just a moment. "I'll take the next shuttle, min kjære." </span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjMzNTY5M2Y2ODQyY2RhZmIxMjc5ZDIxMTRiZDVi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">He pressed something into her hand – a small crystal vial filled with shimmering liquid. Behind him, Sven had managed to work three tentacles through the barrier, forcing Harald to divide his attention.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZmQ0OTZhNTI0YzRiZmM5MGNlM2NlYjE3NDgwZGZl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Keep this safe. Take it to Thorin Hǫggsson at Lund University. </span><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Tell him 'Måne kaller på måne' – Moon calls to moon."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZWEyMTU1YjUyYTQzMWM5NzRjZjlmNGUxMjVhOGVi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"But Pappa—"</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YTg5NGJkNzMyYjRjOThhNWQ0ZDBlYzBmM2FmOTUx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"There's no time, Synne." The childhood nickname caught in his throat, heavy with memory. His eyes flicked to Sven, whose transformation was nearly complete, then back to her. "The vial. The pendant. Both must survive."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjMwY2M1MmI0NTQxM2NiOTY3NmVkNmNlYWQ4MjRl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Sven's roar shook the terminal windows. "She could be magnificent, Harald! Like I!" His chest had split open, revealing chitinous plates beneath. "I'll show her what we can become together!"</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZGI2MWEwYmE0ZDQyNjg5OTAzNTIyMTkzZmI0NWVh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Two more tentacles breached the barrier. Harald grunted with effort, silver light blazing from his hands as he forced them back. His fingers brushed the Pendant of Mánagrát at her throat. "Keep both safe. Promise me."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMTBlMGUwMWQ4NTQ1MDM5NzY0MzVlNDdiNzY4YWE4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I...I..." her lips parted, but no more words came.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOGY1YjlhZTE4MDQ2MWM5YTg2M2I0NTQ5YjRhNzli"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The pendant," Harald continued urgently, even as Sven's assault intensified. "As long as it glows, I am alive and with you. Do you understand?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYTAyYTUyMjMwYjQ3YmI4M2JhZjUxMTRiZGQxZjc5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Sigrún nodded, her throat tight with unshed tears. Behind Harald, Sven had risen to his full height, his transformation nearly complete. Other Draugs were pressing against the barrier now, assisting their leader.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMmEzYmJlMjBmNTQzNTc5MWEwNjMxZDJkYzEzZTU1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Before she could protest further, Harald gave her a gentle push toward the boarding bridge. "Go, Synne. Jeg er glad i deg." The same words he'd say after tucking her in as a child.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYmQ3Nzg5NTNjYTQ5YjViNzEwZGI0NmQ2ZDA5ZThi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Jeg er også glad i deg, Pappa," she whispered back.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZmUzYzQ4ZTcxYjQ2NTc4OGI2YzE3ZjRkYWI0NzMx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You're meant for greater things!" Sven's voice had deepened to something barely recognizable. All five tentacles struck the barrier simultaneously, creating a spiderweb of cracks in the silver light.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NWYwNzJjNTkzZTQ4Yjc4Yzk5MTVhNzllMDFkZTkx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The last thing she saw was her father raising both hands, silver light gathering around him as he faced Sven and the approaching horde. More passengers rushed past her onto the bridge, blocking her view.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNmI4ODAxMGYyNDQwZTc5YzIwOWY5NjE0MWRlYjc5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Final boarding call!" a crew member shouted, already moving to seal the door.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZjdiYmQ1MDE1MjQwNDA5M2M5NWViZGQ2MWUzNDE3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Sigrún tried to turn back, but the crowd pressed her forward. "Pappa!" She fought against the flow of people, elbowing past a businessman, ducking under outstretched arms.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZmI4M2JhMGIzODQ2NDc4ZTdjMGRjZDZlMWUyZjA2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Through gaps between people, she caught fragmented glimpses: Harald's silver lightning cutting through smoke and shadows. His barrier holding as more Draugs gathered around him. Sven's body continuing its grotesque metamorphosis, tentacles fully emerged now, lashing out with increasing strength.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMjAyZTI3OTJlZjQ3NmM5NGQyNzZjZGQ1OWY4YjU5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Crystal will awaken, Harald!" Sven's voice had devolved to something inhuman. "Join my crusade. Or perish!"</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ODBlMTMzMDE5YjRiYzE4MWFlNGMxYjAxNTVmYTUx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Indeed, Skarn, the Crystal will awaken one day." Harald said as he finally faced Sven. "But not for you."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOThjODdiYWRiMTRmMjc5NTE4M2EyNzFmNjlhZDNi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A massive explosion bloomed from somewhere deeper in the terminal. The barrier flickered. Debris rained down. In that moment of chaos, Sigrún broke free from the crowd. She lunged toward the closing door, her father's name torn from her throat – a sound of pure desperation.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNmI3MWE1M2ZjMTRlN2I4MmNkNmU3NjFjOWMyZjY3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"PAPPA!"</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYzMxZWQ3YWZhODQyMGJhM2NmY2E1OGFjNDU4OTc2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Strong hands caught her waist – flight crew, pulling her back. She struggled wildly, reaching out as if she could somehow bridge the growing gap. Through the door's window, she saw the silver dome waver. Her father stood alone at its center, light pouring from his hands as he faced the horde. Their eyes met one final time.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYWM0NzVkY2YzNjRiNjk5NWJiY2I5NWJlMzEyYmQ0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Please," she begged the crew, her voice breaking. "He's my father – I can't leave him—"</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDkzY2UwYTY4NzQ5OTdiMmU5ZDFlYmVhY2Y1MmMy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The bridge door sealed with a pneumatic hiss. Through its small window, Sigrún saw the silver dome collapse as smoke filled Terminal 8. Her father was nowhere in sight, and where Sven had stood, there was only a towering, monstrous silhouette disappearing into the chaos.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYTNlNzFhMWUwNTQxY2I5NTE0Njg3ZDIyZGRiZGQy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Do you have a death wish, girl?" An elderly woman pulled at her sleeve. "Get away from the door!"</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MTg1NzdlMWZlZTQwMWI5NjFhZDAxYWZiNWQxOGFj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She pounded against the door until her fists hurt, screaming her father's name.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YzM0ZWUwNDJlZTQ1ODNhNTNmZDRjM2VhNGY0MGEz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Someone stop her before she breaks the seal!" A man in a business suit snapped, though his voice cracked with barely contained panic.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNmQ3MGJlNWI4ODRiMTBhNWFlYzMyMTI0YmVlZTVk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"La henne være," another passenger said softly in Norwegian. "Let her be. She's lost her father."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxM2ZjZGZmMzYwYzQ3NDM4NWFhMTVlOTVjMGIwM2Nj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The crew had to physically guide her to a seat, her legs barely supporting her weight. Even then, she pressed against the window, searching desperately for any sign of him in the chaos below.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MzUwZDg0NDMwODQ1Y2Y4ZGYxZTU4YjZjODk4Nzlj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"First Bergen, then Trondheim, now Oslo," someone muttered. "Where will we go when there's nowhere left?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOTExNTYzODdkZTQ5ZmJhMzY3ZTgwM2M4OWUwY2Vj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Alliance won't take us," another voice responded bitterly. "Not after what happened in Stockholm."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZDVjNjQ5Y2Q3NTQ4YzFhZTg3OTc5NmFmNTc1ZGMz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"And I'd rather die than setting in that shithole they call 'the Imperium'." more voices.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OGM2YmQxMzI2ODQyNjI4YWE2ZTUxZDdiMTliM2Ey"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">But Sigrún said nothing. Her fingers clutched the crystal vial, tears streaming down her face as Oslo Starport – and her father – disappeared beneath clouds of smoke and snow. The last glimpse of her homeland vanishing like a nightmare swallowed by fog.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZjA4MWFhZDg5YjRmMTY5NWIzMTcwNDZkMzMzNTQx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"My grandson's still in there," an old man whispered, his weathered face pressed against another window. "Working security. He wouldn't leave his post..."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMDUyODhjOTlhYTQyMGY5MDE4MTBlYjI3ZGUwM2Rk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Pendant of Mánagrát grew cold against her ivory skin, its blue light fading to darkness. Sigrún's heart sank as the glow vanished completely. Her father... gone?</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YzEzYjgwOGNkNzQzOWI4ZTM1MzVlOGNiMzEwZGYw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">But as the shuttle broke through the cloud cover, other passengers gathered closer, watching in wonder as the pendant flickered back to life – not the steady pulse of before, but a faint, flickering light, like a distant star struggling to shine through fog.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYWI1YjUwYjNiZjQwNDFiYTNlY2M2ZWVhMzdkZDMw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Look!" A young woman pointed at Sigrún's chest. "Is it one of the psionic jewels?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMjgwNjI1Y2RjMTRhNGJiOTdiYmExNjkyYmJkM2M1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"A sign perhaps," the elderly woman who'd pulled her from the door said quietly. "That not all hope is lost."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYjI0ZWVkYTEzNjQzYTNhZWI0MGNkOTAzZTJkZDM2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Or just another pretty light to guide us nowhere," someone countered from the back.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZWY1ZDZhMGQzYzRmYmE5OTdkYmU4YzYwZmNhNGNm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Sigrún closed her eyes, clutching the pendant and vial to her chest. Each beat of her heart echoed with the same plea: Pappa, pappa, pappa. Her last connection to him now reduced to this faint, pulsing light as the shuttle carried her away from everything she had known.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNjhhNmIxYjU2OTQxNjlhZDkwNzhkZGQ0Y2I4ODQx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She pressed her forehead against the cold window, whispering words she'd said a thousand times before – after nightmares, during storms, in moments of childhood fear when his presence had always been her anchor: "Kom tilbake til meg, Pappa. Come back to me."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZDhlMWU2OGQyYTQ1MGRhMjRhYWIxMDMyYWE0OWYw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">But only the engine's drone answered as Oslo disappeared behind them, swallowed by darkness and snow.</span></p>
