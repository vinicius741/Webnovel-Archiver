That is, until Dooku stood. For a moment, Yoda’s student looked utterly <em>furious</em><span style="font-style: normal">. Mundi flinched where he sat, his hand drifting back towards his lightsaber. The human took a breath, one fist clenching at his side.</span></p>

If it were any other Jedi, we wouldn’t even be having this discussion. </span><span style="font-style: normal">It is possible that, if the Force nexus beneath the Temple is truly dark as she says, that it could have influenced our thoughts, feelings, and behavior over time in ways we wouldn’t even notice,” </span><span style="font-style: normal">he turned his gaze on Mundi at that last part, and the Cerean man turned an affronted look back on Master Windu.</span></p>

<p class="cnNhOWJhYTA3MTAzMTQ1NjE5NTE1N2JmMmE3ZGE2ZTdl" style="margin-bottom: 0">“That is where you are mistaken,” Dooku shook his head, before looking over the council. “It has become clear to me that Master Mundi intends to poison this council’s opinion towards my student, just as it was towards Rael Averross and Qui-Gon Jinn.”</p>

Turning to Yoda, he continued. “I am tendering my resignation from this Council, effective immediately. At the same time, I will be taking on Tanya Mereel as my </span><span style="font-style: normal">P</span><span style="font-style: normal">adawan. We will be leaving for Serenno within the week. There is much to do to rebuild and I feel her time will be better spent away from the temple, without Master Mundi </span><span style="font-style: normal">needlessly </span><span style="font-style: normal">scrutinizing and calling her every action into question. Now, if you’ll excuse me, Master. I must prepare for our departure. Good day.”</span></p>

<p class="cnM3MDkzNjhkMjk3MjRjNmViYjg4Mjc4NTFhNDdlODgy" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Sit,” Yoda ordered, sending Mundi a stern look. “Act rashly, this Council will not.”</p>

<p class="cnMwZWFkYTYyZmRjODRlMjc4OTgwZGMwNzZjMmY5MGZj" style="margin-bottom: 0">“This is an outrage! Mundi tried to draw his saber on a child!”</p>

<p class="cnM2ZTFmM2ExZWRjOTRiYmNhODRjZjIyOTRiNjU5OWVl" style="margin-bottom: 0">The Council quickly devolved into an uproar as everyone tried to speak at once, some shouting over the others to be heard. Yoda sighed and looked to Mace, who shook his head, then stood.</p>
<p class="cnNiZjFiOTc5ZTNiYzRmZjA4MDJmZTkxOGNhNGZhNDlh" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM3ZWZmMzM4NjhjNTQ2ZDRiYWUzZTYxMDY2ODgxMDAw" style="margin-bottom: 0">“I believe I’ve said what I need to say. I’m going to see if I can track down our wayward Padawan and speak to her for myself,” he excused himself and left.</p>

<p class="cnM5MTlmZTJlNjkwMTQ0N2M4N2U3NTAyZDI1YTJlMGI1" style="margin-bottom: 0">Unfortunately for Yoda, escape was not so easy. …Or was it?</p>

<p class="cnNmMzhlOWU2NGQwYTRjOGM5YWM2MTgyNWI3NTA2Zjlh" style="margin-bottom: 0">Humming quietly, he took in the others arguing before pushing himself out of his seat. Skirting the edge of the room, he moved calmly towards the elevator. A moment later, he found himself joined by Master Jocasta Nu as the door closed. Chuckling quietly, the old human woman murmured, “I don’t think I’ve seen Dooku that angry in a very long time. Mundi is lucky we don’t allow formal duels anymore.”</p>

<p class="cnMwOWUyMDBjYmQwMjQ2Y2M4MTFjYTdjYWJjZGJmY2Y0" style="margin-bottom: 0">Yoda sighed, leaning on his cane. “Wasteful, it is. Divided, we are, when our attention should be turned outward. Towards those who orchestrated the fall of Serenno.”</p>
<p class="cnMwNTY1Yzk0NDA2OTQ2ZDhiN2ViYTI3ZTMzNmFiYTQx" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM4NTJkY2E4OWUwNzQ0NTg5NGQ3MmQ0NmFkNDQ3NmIx" style="margin-bottom: 0">“I agree, but it seems Mundi has made up his mind. You know how he gets. He has to be the smartest one in the room. Prideful.”</p>

<p class="cnM0NmYyYjZjMzhjNTQyZTU4MjQwMmFmYWJjMWU3ZjJj" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Blinded by pride, he is,” Yoda agreed. “But not wrong that something is amiss, I think.”<br/><br/></p>
<p class="cnM0ZWJkNjA4NzcwMTQwMmM5OGZjMDcyMDg5ODEzZjg0" style="margin-bottom: 0">“With the girl? What?”</p>

<p class="cnMxNmMxNzI2ZDA1ZDQ2NGZiZWI4YzZiZmQ2YmZkNzhl" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Mm… Not sure, I am. Dooku knows. Qui-Gon as well. And trust her they do.”</p>

<p class="cnNmNDVlYTlkMjcwZDRiODY5ZGRmZmVmNmZiM2E2NTY0" style="margin-bottom: 0">Master Nu nodded as the elevator came to a stop. “Then it sounds like it’s a question of who do you trust more. Your student and his students? Or Master Mundi?”</p>
<p class="cnM1YjMwYjY2OTFmMDQ2ZjU5ZTI1ZWFiMGFjMDQ4NGNh" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnMzNmJkMmExZDA3MzQ3OTNhZjY5YTY1ZjIwN2RkZjg0" style="margin-bottom: 0">Yoda’s cane clicked on the floor as he left the elevator, Master Nu following. “A question it is not. The answer, I already know.” Glancing upwards, he instructed, “What records we have on the nexus below the Temple, please forward them to me.” Considering for a moment, he added, “The Bogan archive as well, you should search. If the secret is to be found, I believe that is where.”</p>
<p class="cnMwZjU0MzliMGQzODQzNWQ5NmYzNjEyODAxMWIzNGNi" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM5ZDJkNmFlNzZmMjQ2NWE4MDMwNDU1ZjhkZTEyODYz" style="margin-bottom: 0">“I’ll get my students to start digging through the public archive while I search the other. I’ll send you the results,” the woman nodded, turning off at the next intersection to make her way towards the library, leaving Yoda to make his way outside to find a nice place to meditate.</p>

After all, it always paid to know who you were working with. And while their service record might not give one all the details, it was a good start. Combined with the assessments of other Masters in written notes and audio log minutes from various council meetings, performance reviews, and the like—along with digging up everything I could find on them on the public network—I believed I had a working idea of what to expect from most of the Masters holding position within the Order.</p>

In the past, the Jedi were an order o</span><span style="font-style: normal">f</span><span style="font-style: normal"> warrior monks, seeking enlightenment through the Force and training themselves to fight should the need arise. At some point, we spread, grew in power, and changed—that was the era of Jedi Lords.

So, I didn’t sugar-coat it. “I think, in the aftermath, the Jedi crippled and fully suborned themselves to the New Republic. We did away with the Jedi Lords and left those worlds in the mid- and outer rim to fend for themselves to withdraw to Coruscant. We disarmed ourselves of our fleets, because we didn’t want to be seen as a threat.

And while the physical exercise and training requirements are still there, many shirk their duties to keep themselves ready for battle in favor of what they see as more important. Worse, those who have taken on more political roles have… picked up some bad habits. They treat the Order like they do the Senate, where they feel they have to argue, scheme, peddle influence, and trade favors in order to get anything done—and there are enough of them that their mentality has started to infect the rest of the Temple. After all, if you’re passed up for promotion, but you see that another Padawan who was friendly with and did a few favors for a certain Master wasn’t, or if you see that others who are friendly and do favors for those Masters always seem to get the best assignments, extra or special training, or some other benefit then it’s only natural that you’ll learn that if you want those things for yourself then the easiest thing to do is play along.”</span></p>

That </span><em>didn’t happen</em><span style="font-style: normal">. As it turns out, the incompetent tend to get promoted off the field and away from where they can do the most direct harm, while the most competent get thrown back into the meat grinder time and time again.

The person I cared for most.” Looking up, I met his eyes and continued, “And when I woke up as a baby again, I was </span><em>understandably upset</em><span style="font-style: normal">. Unfortunately, I wasn’t a simple human this time, but part of a race who sense emotions naturally. So when my mother brought her child home and that child woke up feeling the loss of her friends, the frustration, anger, and humiliation of being on the losing end of a war and the </span><em>pointlessness</em><span style="font-style: normal"> of it all… she panicked and gave me up. And before you ask, no, I don’t blame her. I tracked her down and spoke with her a few years ago. She apologized and seemed happy that I was doing well, but there’s no connection there.”</span></p>
