<p class="cnNiZTYyMGQ5OWJhYjRlNDVhNmYzOWM2YWNhMDIxNGM2"><strong><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">01:10, February 10, 2295</span></strong></p>
<p class="cnNhZDI2NjgwNzI2NzQ4YTM5MWQ2YjFjMTBmZmI2YzRm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Topaz High-Rise, 31 Avenue de la Victoire, Central Business District, Abidjan, Ivory Coast, Emerald Directorate territory</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNjBhZjFhZDk4NTQyMTY5ZmU4NzcxNjlhMTA2MWQ2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Quantum Lift hummed as it carried Jabari through the Topaz High-Rise. Sixty-six floors between him and the infamous Kimaris Warband. His new assignment. The richest warband in the Directorate, they said. The one with the highest body count too.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NWFjZjJiMTY2MTRiMGRiNGVkZjE4NTc5YzNiODhk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Through the transparent walls, Abidjan's midnight skyline sparkled. Hovercrafts moved between buildings like beads of light. Everything looked so orderly from up here. So civilized.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYTQ2ZDk2Nzc4MjQ4MjI5MjM4YTA5Yjk1YjJhNTM3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Not like the stories he'd heard about Kimaris. About Prince Laurent N'Guessan. The man they called insane at Cape Coast Prep.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOGMzZGQ5ZGJjZTQzMDg5NTFhNjIwNjY3Mjk1NDcz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The lift's comm system crackled. "Radi-Mon incursion contained at plaza level. Damage assessment underway." The automated voice was followed by updates about security protocols and medical teams being sent to the plaza.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYmMxODVlMjEzMjRjZTc4MzYyOWI1M2ZjN2I0NjM4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari felt his shoulders tighten. The bodies of the guards he couldn't save flashed through his mind. He might need to report the casualties, explain the damage to the vehicles. But at least he'd stopped the Kraken. At least some had survived.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYTAxMDdiYmRjODQ3M2U4NWU1YjQ0MmE4NjdhZDZj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Unlike that night in Kumasi.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYmM5OWM5ODA5NDQ2M2NiNzI2MGEyZDFjOGI0ZTc5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Quantum Lift chimed. Jabari straightened his uniform and squared his shoulders. The doors opened to reveal a plush waiting area. A blonde figure stood by the window, silhouetted against the city lights.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MTc5Njg5OTQyNjQ0MGM4ZTYyYTYxYzU4M2UxYzcy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Well, well," said a familiar voice. "The boy from Accra. Though I suppose you're Lieutenant Adomako now?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMjU4YWJmNzkzNjQ3MDBhMDYzZjc5ZWIxNjI1YTQ3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Wilhelm! It's been — eight years, sir." Jabari faced the same blonde-haired man he'd met years ago.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzY2YwMjY2MTg1ZTRhYjBiNzM4YWE1YWQ4ZTk0YTU3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Though Wilhelm's green uniform now showed the rank of Major, his casual stance hadn't changed, and his handsome features hadn't aged. It was as if they'd just met last month.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYjViZTNmYjRhNTQ4ZjU4NDIzM2U5ZmUxMDc2OWUw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Good memory!" Wilhelm turned, his profile sharp in the low light. He gestured to a hovering drink tray. "Care for some orange wine before you…meet the wolves?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MWE1MzRiODUxYjQ2NzViNWM1NjRmM2QwYzMwYThm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"No, thank you, sir."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZmFiYWVjYjdiMjRmODE4NDc2MDRmNWEzZDY1MjQ2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Your choice. Drop the 'sir,' though." Wilhelm took a glass for himself.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOTQyMDcyNzUzZjQ5ZjhhOTg1YmFmN2MzNzY4MDAz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You don't mind?" Jabari asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZjA0MTdjZWNiMjQ0NDA4YjlmMGFhMGYyMGQ4ZWY1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"In this warband, actions speak louder than ranks." Wilhelm took a sip. "I'm impressed. Not many make it through Cape Coast Prep when they start with backgrounds like yours."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMGM3MTMyNjEyNjRiYWU5MGNlMWU1MDVjZjI0Y2Rk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You mean dropping out of high school," Jabari said bluntly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OTdjZTBmMzI2OTRlOGE4MGYyOTM1ZjliOGYwYjJl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Wilhelm's smile widened as he sipped his wine again. "I had to spend three years in college before realizing slaying Radi-Mons is more fun. You seem wise in contrast."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NjVlYTI3OGQ1ODRhODFhYzNjZmYyZjQ1MWUyZTAz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari's expression remained solemn. "My grandma…I wish she were alive to see this."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNzA1NzBhODllZjQ2ZDY5MTg2YTA3YjJiYTcxZGE5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Ah, yes. Your grandmother." Wilhelm studied him over his glass. "The one who died in the Kumasi Incident."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OGU4ZGEwMWY0MTQ3YWViZmMxOTM4NTI2YzI3MWJk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari nodded, surprised Wilhelm remembered. "Grandma Kisi. She locked me in a storage cellar when the Bone Fiends came. I heard..." He stopped, the memory still raw.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YmQ3MGIwYWVhMDQ4ZjNiMzM2ODk3ZDhkNDg5MmI5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You heard everything," Wilhelm finished for him, his voice less casual now. "Quite a burden for a child to carry."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNTk5NmU2NzdjZjRhYmNhMTUyNGMwOTFhNjFkNTY5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"It's why I'm here," Jabari said simply. "I couldn't save her. But I can save others."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MmI4MDU2YmIwNTQ4YWE4OTY3MGY1NzBmMDlkZmIw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"May her spirit remain with the Thousand Gods." Wilhelm drained his glass and set it back on the tray. "Walk with me. Celine has the others tied up in some boring meeting about Laurent. We have a few minutes."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YmQ4YzY4NjM2ZDRkZGY5NTI2ODQxYzlkN2YyODFk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari walked beside him, noting how Wilhelm remained unhurried despite the security alert. "I heard Commander Laurent is missing?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZjBlYmQ3N2Q2MzQ3NWZiOTJiNTJmYTExMTA1M2Q4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Six days now," Wilhelm confirmed, his accent more pronounced. "Guess he went off on some mystical mission to commune with the 'African spirits' or whatever it is he does. Celine's been beside herself, though she'd never admit it."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlY2NmNGY5Y2MzZDQxMjQ5M2I5NGFjYTIzZTVkNTIw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The corridor stretched before them, decorated in the Directorate's emerald and gold. Zephyrium processors were housed in golden frameworks along the walls, their blue-white light pulsing with the building's power needs.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjU0MzBkMTc5ODQ2OTQ5NjM5NzdkMTY0YWQxNDgy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Your reasons for joining are rather noble," Wilhelm said, glancing at Jabari. "Mine are — less poetic."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MWEzNzUxMGM2MjQ2ODk4NmQ4NzEzZTI3Y2YyZjli"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Your reasons?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OTUyNzBhNjhmOTQxYzdhZDdiMzVmMzQyNjUwYWNm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Wilhelm grinned, spreading his arms. "The money is good, and the women I get to bed on Venus are even better! Kimaris has the highest hazard pay in the Directorate. Three missions and I can afford a month in Scollay II with the finest Leased Lilies money can buy."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNGE4Mzg3ODE0MzQzYTE5NDBkZDE5MTFjN2E4YTA0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari was momentarily speechless.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMDU1OTJkZTIzODRmOGNhODU3NzczZTE5NzllM2Ux"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Don't look so shocked, now," Wilhelm said, clapping him on the shoulder. "We all have our ways of coping with what we see out there. Some build shrines to divine causes. I prefer more...tangible comforts."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YjI4MWVhM2JjMzRkNTc5NTM5ODI2Y2M0YzYzZGQ5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">They reached a doorway marked with the Protea King White emblem in polished metal.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MzczOGIzNWQxNzQ4MTVhMjRmY2NhMmUwYTFhOTA3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Now," Wilhelm's voice dropped, "a bit of advice before we go in. You'll be meeting Celine Kamara—brilliant strategist, second-in-command, terrible sense of humor. And Seydou Diop—engineering genius, borderline paranoid — impressive holo-porn collections on his terminals, though."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YzQ4YWVmYjNjODQ4ZTM5ZDFkMWMxZjZhMDMxOGYy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Right. Ugh, thanks for telling me." Jabari let out a nervous chuckle.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OTU5MDI5MmZjZDQ5MGM4NTQxNzY5ODQ1YzIzNTg1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"They're arguing about whether to keep searching for Laurent or chase down some new lead. Keep your opinions to yourself unless directly asked, understood?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYjdmZTM1ZDMxNDQyYzJhYWNlMTU1N2RkZWRjN2I3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari nodded, grateful for the warning.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZTAxNjM0NzFmYjRkODE5YjAzYTlkM2ZlNTZlNTA0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Also," Wilhelm added, "that business downstairs with the Kraken is good work. Not many recruits face down a psychic Radi-Mon on their first day and live to tell about it."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZThjNmQwMWM3YzQ2ZjQ5ZDJhZDkyMmMxZmU0MThi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Psychic?" Jabari frowned. "It spoke—is that unusual?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYzlmYzhhMDhhNzQyN2Y4ZjQ5M2Q1NjBhY2FhM2Zh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Very. Most Radi-Mons are just animals. The ones that can speak are connected to something larger." Wilhelm's casual tone was gone now. "Something watching us. Remember that."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5N2FlZThkYzZhNTRjZjBhNmE3MGEwZmU4MGJiNDc4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">With that warning, Wilhelm pushed open the doors to reveal a command center in controlled chaos. Holographic displays showed both surveillance footage of the plaza below and what appeared to be search patterns for a different operation.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NmI2Yzg3NTA3OTQxNzU4MTQ3YjFjYjYyZmI0ODIx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"—cannot and should not abandon the search!" A woman's voice, sharp with authority, cut through the room. The speaker stood with her back to them, dividing her attention between the plaza footage and another display showing terrain Jabari didn't recognize. Her green ceremonial robes had delicate golden patterns. "Laurent's been missing for six days, and now we have Radi-Mons attacking directly at our doorstep!"</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZWEwOWZlODI1NjQ5YTdhMDZhNjM1MGRkNDMyZTgz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"And nothing will happen while we bicker," Wilhelm said as they entered. "May as well take it easy someplace else?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYWMwOGM5ODQ2YzRkMmViZmIxMmIxN2Q1NTc3ZmJj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Like hell, Wilhelm!" A shorter man sat on the edge of a desk crowded with holographic displays, his round glasses reflecting cascading data. Wires and gadgets adorned his uniform like medals. "You just want an excuse to run back to your comfort women on Venus!"</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYmQ4YWRiOTcxOTQxMjY4NDYxMjBkMTI0NTE1ODli"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Seydou," the woman started, but stopped as she turned and noticed Jabari. Her dark eyes assessed him carefully. Everything about her screamed nobility – from her twisted hair to her posture.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NmI5M2Y4ZjkzMTRmYThhNjMyYTM3OTUwZmYwMmI1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The tension in the room was palpable.</span></p><span class="cmU0OGI1ODU3YmVkNjQ3OTk5OTlmNDc3MjBiMjYxZmVk"><br/>Stolen from its rightful place, this narrative is not meant to be on Amazon; report any sightings.<br/></span>
<p class="cnMzMzU1NWVlODA0NzQ4ZDQ5ZDVlZjUzZTBjYWY4ZmZi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Lieutenant Jabari Adomako," she said, her voice more measured. Her gaze flickered to the others. "Welcome to the Kimaris HQ." She glanced at Wilhelm. "I see the Major has already intercepted you."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ODc2ZDc0ZWQxMjQ0OGU5NTFmYzIyMDg4NDA2YzVh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Just providing our new recruit with some context, Celine," Wilhelm replied smoothly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYmZiMGRkM2I4MjQyZmQ4OTA0ODI0MWVhYzk4MmY5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Ma'am." Jabari kept his voice steady despite his racing heart. "Wilhelm was briefing me on the current situation."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZWZkN2E4NDg5ZDRkZWRiNWQ4YTQzN2I0YWJjZGMz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A humming filled the air as the center of the room shimmered. A hologram appeared – a tall figure in an emerald suit with golden ropes. The stern face of Chairman Kofi Mensah regarded them with a stony expression.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYWFlOTBjZTY0ODQ3NGQ4ZTM0MmZhMDBjNmI3ZGFh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Dr. Kamara, I require your report," the Chairman's deep voice filled the room.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMDhiMTY5ZGFjNTRlNWM4MDRkNjFlMDViYmIyYzQy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Celine straightened, her earrings catching the light as she addressed the hologram. "Chairman, we've continued the search for Prince Laurent on the Near Side of Osram, but have yet to locate—"</span></p>
<p class="cnMyM2MxNzhhNTBmYTQ4MDI4ZDc4YjYxNzVhYWFhMjI4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Found it!" Seydou's excited voice cut through. He sprang up from his workstation, fingers moving through floating data. "Sorry to interrupt, but this is exactly what I was trying to show everyone." He gestured at the holograms, which formed a pattern of quantum transmission signatures.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZGY4NGU2Yzg3ODQxZDk4MWI2NTkxYTgxMTA5Nzgz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"What are we looking at, Seydou?" Chairman Kofi asked, his hologram turning slightly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNTY2ODY5NmM5YjRmMzE5MzViYWUzODJkMGUzZTMy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Two days ago, I detected unusual quantum entanglement patterns in transmissions between Taiwan and the Imperium mainland," Seydou explained, his hands moving through the data. "They're moving something valuable they're calling U6-M9."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTM4NDllNDExMzQ3ZWU5NTExZjBmODVhMjRhNGE3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"An android designation?" the Chairman asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YTFlMjI3OTdhOTQ0Y2Y4ZjkxNTVjMmM2OGM3MTIw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Seydou nodded enthusiastically. "Yes, but not just any android. The transmission patterns suggest it's carrying data about something called the Moondust Crystal. And they're rushing to wipe its memory once it reaches Mainland China."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxY2UwZTE0MzFhNDQwYTI4ZWRkM2I1YzhmNDM2NjVl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari remained silent, watching the interaction. The Moondust Crystal was clearly significant.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOWZlYjNmYWVhZTRjYTY5ZGRmNTRlOGE3MDgyM2E3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Moondust Crystal," Celine said softly, almost reverently. "If the Imperium has data on its location..."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YmYzYWM4MTI5NTRmMDI5YzlhNzgxY2MwZjU4NTA0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"If it even exists," Wilhelm added, leaning against a console.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZGU3ODIyZDUzMjQ3MGRhNzgzYWM3MTViOTlmMGIz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Chairman Kofi's hologram turned sharply. "It exists. Our intelligence suggests the Alliance already has operatives moving on it. We're in a race, and we're already behind."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYzk5M2Y4YjhmZTQyODc5NDM2OWUzMWU2NTFmMTIw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"That breach at the Amber Moon Spire? Not a coincidence." Seydou pulled up another holographic display, his fingers tracing patterns. "Look at these transmission patterns of this android, though. Whoever used to own it uploaded a massive encrypted dataset into its positronic brain. The Imperium officials who confiscated it have no idea what they're sitting on."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzY2I1ZWE5Zjg5MjQ1ZThhYjE0NjRlNTdkNGQ1ZDk3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"And you've managed to decrypt it?" Celine asked skeptically.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OWJlMzM4NThmZjQzOGJiYTA5YjE5ZTA4OTJhZmYx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Not entirely, but enough to know what we're dealing with," Seydou replied, his glasses reflecting data streams. "They're planning to transport this U6-M9 to mainland China for a memory wipe in less than 48 hours. That's not standard procedure for a simple service bot."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NWE4OWJmYzc5ZTQxMDBhMjUyODk1MzljOTE2ZDIx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Chairman Kofi's hologram turned to Celine. "Doctor, your assessment as Second-in-command?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYmQxZjAxZTc5YjQ1ZWRiOGMxNjIwMWM1MjUwOTI5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari saw the conflict on her face, watched her glance at the door as if Laurent might walk through it. When she spoke, her voice was tight. "The Moondust Crystal... If there's even a chance it exists, we cannot ignore this intelligence." She took a deep breath. "But Prince Laurent—"</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MzE3MjFmY2Q5MTRlN2Q5NDFjZWU2OWMzNzI2YWFk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Is one of our finest," Chairman Kofi finished. "And the search will continue. But Dr. Kamara, you know as well as I do what he would prioritize in this situation."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTYwZDljNDc4MzQyN2M5YTE5ZGU2NDkxMjQ1ODc0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A heavy silence fell over the room. Jabari felt the weight of it, understood suddenly why Kimaris had its reputation. They didn't just fight Radi-Mons – they made the hard calls.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZDk5YTk1NTFmMTQzZDM4N2U1Mzg1MjNkMzI1MDQ0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Wilhelm broke the silence. "I still believe our resources could be put to better use. This U6-M9 could be any standard android for some rich retired grandpa with an impressively bad memory."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Zjk5MDY3YTFkYTQxZjA5NGE1YWMzM2U2MDY1MWU2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Then explain why they're rushing to wipe it," Seydou countered, his earlier excitement hardening. "The Imperium doesn't move this fast. Unless—"</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNWE2YmQyMzVhNDRhOTRiY2FlZTgzMmE3ZTQ1MWQ4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Unless they know they have something valuable," Jabari found himself saying. All eyes turned to him, including Chairman Kofi's penetrating holographic gaze. But having started, he pressed on. "And they're vulnerable right now. Their forces are spread thin trying to deal with the disturbance at the Amber Moon Spire."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ODAyYTBiOThmNjQ0YTA4YjllZDI1NTYxOWM2Yjc0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You've been keeping up with international developments?" Celine observed, raising her eyebrows slightly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MTM1ODBiYjNkZDRjOGY4ZGJlMTZkMjAyZDQ3M2U4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yes, ma'am," Jabari nodded. "It was part of our tactical awareness training. The Imperium rarely deploys forces to handle public disturbances unless it's serious."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MjI4Y2U0MzdmYTRhY2I5OWVhYWYzZDAwYTQ0ZWJj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Lieutenant has a point," Celine said. Her earrings caught the light as she turned to the displays.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2M2QxZjc5YjYzNjQ4YzFhZWExMjFhMzgwZjgxZWEx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Seydou, how much time do we have before the memory wipe?" Kofi turned to the technician.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNDZhNjQ2ODM2NDQ2ZGJhMmUyOWExMTczMDM0Yzk2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Based on the transmission patterns..." Seydou's fingers moved through the data. "Less than 48 hours. They're keeping U6-M9 at the Azure Mount Logistics Hub in Taiwan. Staging point for cargo heading to Mainland China."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZWU4YzE4Yzg5MjQwYzRhMGUyZDI4NGJkYWM5N2Uz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Taiwan?" Jabari interjected. "The same place where that Alliance operative just breached ZenFusion?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MzhlMjliODE4YjRlNWU5MmZiNTdkOTEzZWUyNmMz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Seydou's eyes lit up. "Exactly! The Imperium's scrambling, moving assets. Whatever that blonde woman was after, it's got them spooked enough to accelerate their timelines."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMDlkNmMzMmM5MjRjYzE5NjllY2IxZGM3OTkzNTFi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Bloody hell, that's rather convenient." Wilhelm's cultured accent dripped with sarcasm. "A logistics hub instead of a proper military facility. Almost too easy."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNzhhMjM0NGJiMDRhMDU5MGJlZjFmMWY1MGFkOTIy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Too easy?" Seydou scoffed. "The Imperium uses forced labor there. Security might be lighter, but the workers are like drones. They'll notice anything out of pattern."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MjgyYzA3MTM2ODRiZTk4ODQxYTM5ODgyMTEzYmY0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Then we don't give them a pattern to notice," Celine said, her eyes narrowing thoughtfully. "We go in as cargo ourselves."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzM2RmNjE5MmM4NjQ5OTBiMjY0YzcyMmQxNmY1ODY0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Chairman Kofi's hologram shifted, his ceremonial ropes gleaming. "A risky strategy, Doctor. But potentially effective. Lieutenant Adomako—"</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNjNjOTQ2OTE2YjQzMWY5ZDMwYTg3MDViODRiZDg1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari straightened instinctively.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMjNmNTYxYWU4ZjQyNWI4MTdkMWVmMTM3ODVlMmQx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Your Scarab could provide necessary backup if the situation deteriorates. But getting it into position..."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NmQ1YmE2OTIxYjQ5Nzg5NmE0NWEwN2QyODI3ZWNi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"We could ship it in a separate container," Seydou suggested, already pulling up manifests. "Disguised as industrial equipment. A different route from our own, but both converging at the right moment."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OTE5YWNmNmM4YTQxMDliZDIxMzg3YjYyMmJmYWU5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Rather elaborate for a simple android retrieval," Wilhelm drawled, examining his nails.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZjcxMjU1ZDcwNzQ3ODQ4ZjEyOGIxNjVmYmMxYzc4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari studied the holographic layout, calculating entry points, escape routes, and choke points where a Scarab could make the difference. "The loading bays here and here," he pointed, "appear designed for heavy industrial equipment. Perfect cover for bringing in the Scarab."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYWQyMTRiZTlmODQyZGE5YzNhYjNjMGQ2NWFjYjFj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Good eye, Lieutenant," Seydou said, impressed. "We can sync the delivery schedules, make it look like routine machinery replacement."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YTY3ZjhkN2QwMDQ2ZTZiNjhiYjQ5ZmVlYWRiZjRl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Time frame, Chairman?" Celine asked, her eyes on the blueprints.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NWEzOWZlYTAyMTRiZGViYzZkZWU1MjQ3MzI5ODIx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You should move out tonight," Kofi declared. "The longer we wait, the more likely the Imperium realizes what they have. Dr. Kamara, I trust you'll handle the operational details. And..." his hologram flickered slightly, "continue the search for Laurent when this is done."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMDZmZGU2NWEzOTQ2YTdiYTQxYzAwZGE3MjFlZTZl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The mention of their missing commander sent tension through the room. Jabari saw Celine's hands clench, while Wilhelm's casual pose stiffened slightly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMWQwNGUxMDM3ODRiM2Y5OTExZGIzMWVmZjJjNWVi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Understood, Chairman." Celine's voice was steady, but her earrings trembled as she nodded.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlM2ViZWExNGNjZjRjODQ4ZGFiYjY0ODhmNmQyNWVj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Anansi guides your path." The hologram of Chairman Kofi flickered once more before dissolving into emerald motes.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDI1NTM4MTg5MTRjOWM4NjE2YmE5N2UyY2IyODM2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As the Chairman's presence faded, Celine turned her attention to Jabari. There was something evaluating in her gaze.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYTE0YjgwMDU4NjQwYzc4ZmRlMWNiZmNkYTljZDZl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Lieutenant Adomako," she said. "I'd like a word with you privately. The rest of you, prepare for departure. We move out at 0300."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzVmNTVjZmVkZDRjMzY4NDZiN2U2ZTVmMmRjZGVj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Wilhelm and Seydou exited, leaving Jabari alone with Celine in the command center.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZjA3N2NkMDRkNjQ5Yjk5MmQ4NTQ3MmIxOWYwNDFk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Your handling of the Kraken situation was impressive," she began, "though your aim needs work. We can't afford collateral damage in populated areas."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMWJkMDFkMTk2ODRlYWQ4NDZlMTAxN2QzYjhiOWRi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yes, ma'am. I apologize for that."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YzQwY2I0MTM5YTQ0ZGJiMDU0NDU1NmQ1ZTgxZTUy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Don't apologize. Improve." Her tone was direct but not unkind. "Sergeant Keita spoke highly of your dedication during training. Said you never missed a session, even when injured. That kind of commitment is rare."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMGQ5ZTBiZTUxNDQwMzI4MmIwMDkxZWI4MTIzMDhi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari stood straighter at the mention of his mentor. "Sergeant Keita taught me everything I know about discipline."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMmMxY2Y0MjNhNDQ5Y2FiZjVmYTkyNTFlYWQyZjMx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"And yet," Celine continued, studying a holographic readout of his training records, "you've consistently underperformed in simulations despite excellent real combat metrics. Care to explain that discrepancy?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OGYyZTAwYjRmMzQ1MmViMTE1OTkzYTI4Y2ViMWNj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The question caught him off guard. "I... I overthink during simulations, ma'am. When there's no real danger, my mind wanders to past mistakes, what-ifs. In real combat, there's no time for that. Only action."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZWQ3ZjI4ZjRjMjRkOWU5YmNiMmE0NjAzYWViNjc3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Celine nodded slowly. "The Kumasi incident. It's in your file."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNmJmYzljMmExZDQwYjBhMDM5MDcyMzY5YzZiMGRh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yes, ma'am."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OWI2NWUyZDBiNjQ0NGNiNGUyYjRlODJkNDhhYzI5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Your grandmother saved your life that day. Now you want to save others." It wasn't a question.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOThkMmFmZTIyOTQ0NWU4NWRlZWFjN2IxNzgzZWQ4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"That's correct, ma'am."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMjdlYTgwZTYwZTQ0MDQ4MjE1MjgxOGM3MGI3Y2E1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"A noble goal." She dismissed the holographic records with a wave. "But in Kimaris, good intentions aren't enough. We face the worst threats humanity has ever known. If you let your past cloud your judgment in the field, you won't just fail yourself—you'll fail your team."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YTIwOGZjNjk4ZjQ0OWJiMDVkMGRmNDdiODQzYWY2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I understand, ma'am."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNjc0MTA4ZDYxNTQ4NjZhY2VjMzUxOTU0OWRlMWIx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Do you?" Her gaze was penetrating. "Lieutenant, in Kimaris, we're all haunted by something. The difference between the living and the dead is learning to use your ghosts, not being used by them."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNTk1OGRmZmVjYTQ3Nzc5ZTQxNDE3MzljMjA0ODRh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The wisdom in her words struck Jabari deeply.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OWFiMDZiOTRkOTQzYmQ4MzViYjEyOGI3Y2JiM2Iw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"This mission to Taiwan is relatively straightforward," Celine continued. "But make no mistake. This is just the beginning. The threats we face are growing. The Fenris Horde on Mars. The Tiamat Horde in the asteroid belt. And now reports of the Jokull Horde emerging on Europa."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MzBhNThlMTgzNTQyOGNiMTQ0Zjg1NWUxN2IwZDZk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She moved to a display showing rotating images of various Radi-Mon types. "We are the front line against extinction, Lieutenant. Not just Africa's. Humanity's. Do you understand?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYzlhNzUzMmIwZjQzYTdiMTQ1NzdhNmE1MzQ2YzVk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari straightened, feeling both honored and sobered. "I do."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMjk1M2NlYzY5YTQ0MjNhNGYyNTE1YTkzZjY1OTlj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"In Laurent's absence, my word is law in this warband," Celine concluded. "Report to Seydou for your Scarab modifications, then rest. We depart at 0300 hours."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNTY0N2QxY2FjMjRhODE5Yjk5M2U0NGFiZDRiMDYy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yes, ma'am," Jabari replied, turning to leave.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYzIzNWE2NDhlZDQyZWRiNGYzOGZmZWI3MjE1ZWRj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The doors closed behind him. This wasn't just about fulfilling a promise to his grandmother anymore. It was about standing as a shield between humanity and the darkness that threatened to consume it.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTU4NTk5YjExNTRkMDNhNmFmOTIwMmViZDdiNzgw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">He was ready.</span></p>
