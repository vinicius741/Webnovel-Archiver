    Guys, I'm so excited to share these news with you.
   </p>
   <p>
    <span>
     Netflix
    </span>
    has just acquired the rights to Nucleus and will begin production with
    <span>
     Jackie Chan
    </span>
    (made 30 years younger via AI production) playing Xin and
    <span>
     Sydney Sweeney
    </span>
    as Lorna.
    <span>
     John Boyega
    </span>
    has been cast as Jabari.
   </p>
   <p>
    AND, due to overwhelming demand, I've decided to pivot the series into a
    <span>
     romantic cooking slice-of-life
    </span>
    . Chapter 44 onwards will feature Xin and Lorna attending a baking competition while Dilinur judges their croissants.

    I've also been approached by a major publishing house that wants to turn Nucleus into a
    <span>
     children's picture book series
    </span>
    . The Radi-Mons will now be cute and fuzzy, and all the spicy scenes will be replaced with characters sharing juice boxes.

   Okay, on a serious note, Chapter 43 will be coming in an hour or so. It will be the last chapter in the
   <span>
    daily release phase
   </span>
   , and after that, we'll be transitioning to a more relaxed release schedule (an announcement will be made later this week).

   So, I'll see you in Chapter 43!
