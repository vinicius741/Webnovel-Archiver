<strong>
           In the shadows of the cyberpunk future, a magical girl is born.
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          The magical girls and guardians are dead. Earth is flooded with mythical creatures, the paranormal and the eldritch. Humanity is relegated to sprawling cities and ruled by megacorporations who liken themselves to the divine. Ghostslayers – armed with cybernetics and guns – stand between humanity and extinction, but are bereft of morality and answer to the highest bidder.
         </p>
<p>
          Two years after losing her parents in a wraith attack, Evantra awakens as the world’s final magical girl in an abandoned laboratory. She is gifted the ability to use occult artefacts to access skills and rituals fuelled by the souls of her enemies.
         </p>
<p>
          With a series of mysterious murders and the arrival of a megacorp to the slums of Wisptown, Evantra’s journey to becoming an [eldritch] Ghostslayer begins. She must find ways to level up, expand her repertoire of guns, artefacts and friends, and uncover the secrets behind her awakening. Maybe, she’ll even make it all the way from her late parents’ church to Elsecaller city.
