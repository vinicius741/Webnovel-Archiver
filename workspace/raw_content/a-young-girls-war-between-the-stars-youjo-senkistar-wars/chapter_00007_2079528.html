<p class="cnM1YzgwOTVjYzBkYjRhOTA4MmVhNDJmM2U4ZWQ0ZmQy" style="margin-bottom: 0">“How is she doing?” Dooku asked, looking down on the sparring ring from the observation booth, where the red skinned, white haired form of Tanya stood across from another student—a green skinned Twi’lek female who looked to be in one of the more senior classes to Tanya’s own. The Twi’lek was easily three years Tanya’s senior, towering over her in height and with superior reach.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZWU4NGYyMzRiODQ4N2E5ZGM5YWYyZjc2MjRlNTk3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNlM2M1ZGEzOGI5OTQzMzA4NGFlZjYwYjkzMGNkN2Rh" style="margin-bottom: 0">A tone sounded and the pair ignited their lightsabers, a green blade for the green girl, while Dooku’s prospective student’s own blade was white with a silver core—rare in and of itself and almost unheard of for coming from Ilum.</p>
<p class="cnNmYTUzNzRlM2M4NDQ0NDRhMGNkZDQ3OTdkYzNjMjYy" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNjMDhiZTU1ZTgxMDRjMmU5MGY5MTY3YjFlNjBjNmRh" style="margin-bottom: 0">He remembered the report on that event. The later exploration and discovering just how deep she went. The revelation of the deep cave structure below the temple. The state Qui-Gon’s padawan Obi-wan had found her in, after apparently killing a gorgodon. Somehow. Unarmed. With a cut that neatly bisected the creature vertically—so thin a lightsaber couldn’t have managed due to the width of the plasma blade and without any of the telltale burns of a lightsaber. It was just one more mystery surrounding the girl.</p>
<p class="cnM5NzZjOWZmOGM3ODRkNjM4MzY3YTExYjk1ZTIzYzg4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNmNDM5YWIzYmZjZjQ1N2ViZjRhMzhjMTg2NGJlZWJl" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Hmm. Advancing quickly, she is,” Yoda murmured from where he stood beside Dooku. “Too quickly, perhaps.”</p>
<p class="cnMyMzk4YjEyMGRmYTQzMGI5YTkzMWQ4OGJhNjE4ZWM4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNjOTNmYWNmMTRiZjQxYzM4M2Q2ZTA4Zjc3N2NkYWNi" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Oh?” Dooku raised an eyebrow, an amused smile quirking his lips up. Yoda frowned at that. “How so?”</p>
<p class="cnM5MTkzNGViN2NlOTQxYzliYTZiNzg5MzkxMzE4ZGUx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM2NmZmMWVlYzFkMzRjOTQ4MWNhNThjODg2YTcxMzdl" style="margin-bottom: 0">Down below, the Twi’lek student rushed Tanya, swinging her saber in one of the opening Form IV patterns. The Zeltron girl skipped back a step as the Twi’lek leapt into the air, before coming down in a spinning slash that would have sent the smaller girl to the ground if it connected. Tanya shifted side-on to her target and lunged forward, a single forward thrust of her lightsaber connecting with the other girl’s chest and sending her sprawling.</p>
<p class="cnM1YTI0NmFmMjg3NjQ0ZjNiNzI5YmVmZjkwYTA2OGYz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNkMDNhZGM0NDg3ZDQ5ZjFhYjA2NDMwMzMyMmY4NmQ4" style="margin-bottom: 0">A chime sounded and Tanya stepped back to her starting position as the green girl picked herself up, frustration radiating off of her that Dooku could feel from the booth. Tanya, meanwhile, was silent in the Force—hidden behind her mental shields. Her body language showed she was being cautious, calculating, and taking the fight seriously—but she showed no signs of emotion at all. Her focus was entirely on her sparring partner.</p>
<p class="cnM3NGMxNzQ0MjgxYzQyNjk5N2M4NmJiZmYwN2NjNTk4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNjMTllMDE1MmZkNjRiZTQ4MjBlYWIwNDMxZjNiYWNi" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Too willful, some of the council feel she is. Impatient. Unwilling to wait, or accept being told to wait. Skirt the rules, then justify her actions with results, she does. Mm, yes. Someone I know, she sounds like.”</p>
<p class="cnMzM2RkOWVmNGEzMTQ3Yzg5ZmNkMzMxYmVjNWZiYmU3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMxYzk1MTAwOWI0ZjRmNzY5YzY3ZDJhODA1ODczMTll" style="margin-bottom: 0">“It’s my understanding that she has been spending time with Qui-Gon’s apprentice,” Dooku chuckled.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZWM0OGIzYzllYjRkZGQ5MGJlMmFmZTAwNGE5NmQ1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMyZTA5NTc5ODM3ZDQwMDhhNzU2OWE4NjYzNGQ4YjBj" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Meant you, I did,” Yoda grumbled, leaning on his cane and moving closer to the window. “Hard to read in the Force, she is. Not hard at all, if one but looks and listens. Speak louder than words, actions do. Unsatisfied with her progress, she is, and so she advances without guidance. Very dangerous, the path she walks.”</p>
<p class="cnMzNzE5Yzk5NjMyNjRjZTY4MzVlNjUxZDI4ZTkzZTYx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMxZTQyMmJlZmQ5ZjRlNmZiZjhmOTNjZjY3MzRmMGJk" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Then perhaps someone should actually guide her, instead of leaving her to her own devices,” Dooku nodded as the chime sounded below and the Twi’lek began slowly circling Tanya, apparently taking her seriously this time.</p>
<p class="cnM2MTM0NGFhNmEwMzQzOGZhZmU2YjIyNGIzM2VhMzJk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNlZTlkMzg0MDQ1ZTQyZjJiYjQzNzE4ZDM2ZmIyOTg3" style="margin-bottom: 0">Deciding to take advantage of her longer reach, she approached more cautiously, resorting to probing strikes while maintaining her guard with Form III. Tanya moved to counter the taller girl, matching her pace and occasionally parrying a strike when she couldn’t dodge, sticking to the most basic of the basics.</p>
<p class="cnNmYzdkNjRjODdlYzQzM2Y5MzViZjEzNDhhZDYzOTA3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM2MWFjZTRhOTA0YTQ5NTE4NzQxMTFlY2FhYmU1YThj" style="margin-bottom: 0">Abruptly, the larger girl lunged forward, coming down hard with an overhead swing, keeping her body outside of the reach of Tanya’s lightsaber. Tanya stepped in, bringing her blade up in a move that, if the sabers weren’t in training mode, would have seen the Twi’lek girl’s wrists severed on Tanya’s blade from the force of her own blow—that is, if the larger girl didn’t stop herself in time.</p>
<p class="cnNjM2ZlMDJiZjQxZjRkZTQ5MGJmODA2NjJjMDhkODg2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNmZjQwNjM4NTNjMDQzNGRhODU4YmM4M2I0M2MzMjlj" style="margin-bottom: 0">Managing to just halt the blow, the taller girl grabbed Tanya’s dominant wrist. This turned out to be a mistake, as the smaller girl let go of her saber, at the same time she stepped in and jumped into a knee strike to the Twi’lek’s groin. The green girl doubled over with a quiet squeal of pain as Tanya caught her saber in her off hand and whipped it around to smack it into the taller girl’s side in a strike that would have bisected her.</p>
<p class="cnNlYTQwZDI4NTI5YzQ1ZTU4NzM2N2U2NDkyY2YyOWZl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNjYjNhNzg0ZmFhNzQzYWZiMThkNzZlZGE5YzU5YzA0" style="margin-bottom: 0">The tone sounded again and Tanya shut off her saber, offering the older girl a hand up. Slapping it away, the Twi’lek girl lunged forward in a swipe at Tanya’s head. Tanya ducked and swung her saber at the same time, activating it and disarming the other girl with a strike to the wrist, catching the green saber and drawing it to her with the Force. A moment later, she had the older girl’s neck scissored between argent and green sabers.</p>
<p class="cnNjOWU1NTBmMzEwZTQ0ODZhMjg5OWVhZmRhNzU3MTA3" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM5MDkyMjBhNjZmZTRkZWQ4ZDBkMTIzMjdjMmFhNjM5" style="margin-bottom: 0">The tone sounded again and this time, the Jedi master monitoring the class stepped out into the ring—a human woman named Depa Billaba, Mace Windu’s former student recently made master herself. Dooku watched as Tanya shut off the other girl’s lightsaber and tossed it to the master, before heading off to the side, to stand beside the other students waiting for their turn.</p>
<p class="cnM4MzViN2YxNWE3NDQ3NDdhMGZkNTgwNGI4NGVjNDVi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM3MTNjZGU3YTY5NDQyNDY5ZjBhNGE2ZmJlZmUwMmM5" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Quick to react in unconventional ways, she is. Sometimes violent, painful ways. Not honorable. Not taught here,” Yoda assessed, and Dooku frowned at the judgment he heard in the old alien’s voice.</p>
<p class="cnMyZWJmM2JiNmYyOTRkMGVhYjhhMjdiMDE4YTU1NjZm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNkYjU2ZDlmMmJjZDQ4ODM5NGM3NWVmNDMyZTJjYzVk" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Against an opponent twice her size and mass, should she not take every advantage she can make for herself?”</p>
<p class="cnNlMDk4MjQzNGJhYzQ5ZmJhMDJkYjlkNWM4ZGUxZTlh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM4Y2ExYjU4NWM3NzQyOTI4YTk5ZDU4ODExOTdlOWEw" style="margin-bottom: 0">“No,” Yoda shook his head. “Win the battle, it may—while losing the war. Not the physical war, but the war of the self. The battle between light and dark. An advantage sought here today, instead of taking the lesson in loss and humility. An advantage sought tomorrow, heeding the call of the dark side of the Force. Creates a pattern, it does. Trains one to think only in one direction, instead of reflecting upon one’s actions and seeking alternate paths, alternate solutions.” Waving his hand down to the Twi’lek girl storming out of the room, Yoda sighed. “Create needless conflict, pain, and suffering, it does.”</p>
<p class="cnNmMzkxMTA4ZmUxYjRlOTVhYzE0OGU1MGQyMWU2OTRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMzODAzZTY3OGVkYjQyY2U4OWM4NWM0NjJjNzg2YzNi" style="margin-bottom: 0">Dooku raised an eyebrow, before scoffing quietly. “You would advise her to lose? Why? To sooth the other girl’s ego? Allow her to save face? No, if there is a lesson in humility to be learned here master, it’s that you shouldn’t underestimate your opponent, and that you shouldn’t allow your emotions to get the better of you when faced with defeat, especially not in a simple spar. But they’re children—”</p>
<p class="cnMzYWU1Zjk4ODhmNDQwNjdiNzVkZDYxNzRmNmI0OTg2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMwNjI4NTZmMTA2MTQ2NmJiYWQ1YjA2YzcyMmIyNTlh" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Last thing she is, a child,” Yoda shook his head. “Feel it too, you do. Treat her not as a child, I have seen.”</p>
<p class="cnMyMjhjYWRjNTAyZTRlM2JiMGU5MmQ2ZjUxZDEwMTdl" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM3ZTM2Zjg2N2I4MzQ5MjFiYjEyNGM0ZGE3NGQ1NGIx" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Perhaps,” Dooku admitted.</p>
<p class="cnM5MDkwNmIxODY2ZjQ0MDhiZjJmZmQyMjhiOGRmNDBh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNiOWU4MTU3NzQxMjRjNzRhNWRiYzUzNDNjYTYwMDA3" style="margin-bottom: 0">The old alien turned to look up at Dooku. “On her advancement, agree with you the council majority does not. Seek a way to slow her we do, without causing resentment.”</p>
<p class="cnMxM2M2MDM5ZmYxYTQ0NzA4YWFjMzFmZDQ3OTRjYzJk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMyNTczMmIyMjVkYTQ3MTI4N2Q3NmY1MTdkM2NlYzg5" style="margin-bottom: 0">“I see you’ve been holding meetings without me,” Dooku sent his former master a rueful look.</p>
<p class="cnNlOTMzNDk2NjA1ZjQwZWNhMzc4M2FmOWFjMWY5ZjE4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNkMmRlYWFiNGU1MjRhNzJiMTY3NjkzMDZmMWJmOWZm" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Too close to see objectively, many of the council feel you are. After your last student, worry you we did not want.”</p>
<p class="cnMxZTQ0MjEwYzM2ODQ4ZDdhYWU1MzUyZmIxZjg0YWJh" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNiMmI0ZmIzNDk4NDRhNmFhYWY1NWQ4ZmVkZDQ1ZTZh" style="margin-bottom: 0">Dooku frowned, but otherwise kept his reaction in check. It was a cheap shot, but his former master wasn’t <em>wrong</em><span style="font-style: normal">. The council were approaching the issue of Tanya cautiously—perhaps too cautiously, in his opinion. Unfortunately, it seemed many of them had made up their minds to take the ‘wait and see’ approach and in the meantime, wanted to try to slow her advancement to a more manageable pace, which just wasn’t going to happen because Tanya herself was too determined, too stubborn to let anything slow her down.</span></p>

<p class="cnM3MjZlMzk0MDNhNzQxYzE5OGMzNjFmMGRlMGQwZjQy" style="margin-bottom: 0"><em>Then the best thing to do would be to try to placate them and at the same time, give her experiences she wouldn’t get here. Unofficially take her on as a padawan early, but without actually saying as much.</em></p>

This time, </span><span style="font-style: normal">Depa</span><span style="font-style: normal"> joined herself and Dooku frowned. “I’m sure there’s a mission suitable to taking her along.”</span></p>

<p class="cnM2NWM4MjRmMWNkYzQ4NDk5YWFhOTZhNzkzOThiODY0" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<span style="font-style: normal">Your padawan, she is not,” Yoda pointed out, but Dooku didn’t sense that he was actually denying the request.</span></p>

<p class="cnNhYmJmYjQwODUzOTRhZTA5NjRmMmVkNjE1NDhkNDFi" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">Yoda chuckled quietly and nodded. “Out of sight, out of mind. But voluntary, it must be. Agree, she must.”</p>

He frowned, then his eyes were drawn to the book I was reading from. After a moment, he nodded. “Yes, I suppose this would be a good excuse to learn how to heal with the Force. I’ll warn you, not everyone can use this method. Don’t be disappointed if it eludes you. There are other, less efficient methods that are easier to learn.”</p>

That’s not entirely uncommon on long term information gathering missions, and Dathomir is a large, mostly undeveloped planet. We wouldn’t be traveling by speeder, as that would draw too much attention.”</span></p>

<p class="cnNjNTg5ZDc4ZjNhYzQxMTY5MGFiMzAxNjBjNWU4MWNl" style="margin-bottom: 0">Grabbing the components of my lightsaber in the Force, I began putting it back together. I had opted to go with a fairly simple design for my very first lightsaber. The body looked like round tube of brushed aluminum with a rubberized grip. There was a simple external horizontal ring that served as a switch just under the emitter with only four settings: off, on, non-lethal, and another off setting, in that order. The emitter had a shroud over the top in case I needed to rest my hand there for extra leverage. Inside was a standard power pack and field charging unit to use the Force to recharge it if needed.</p>

<p class="cnM5MDFiNGEyZDdjYTRkZjhiNzQ3ZWQ4NWIwOGE3YTRh" style="margin-bottom: 0">The whole thing came in at just about a foot in length. When extended, a normal blade would be roughly four feet, nine inches in length. I had done a bit of fine tuning in the months since getting my weapon. A fifteen percent reduction in blade size corresponded to a fifteen percent increase in either power output or runtime. I opted for more runtime, sacrificing nine inches of length to be able to use it for longer if I needed. Of course, being that I was already small and with a short reach, this cut my reach with the blade even further. So, I had come up with a way of increasing that reach during my solo training, involving projecting a mage blade formula from the tip of the saber—effectively doubling the length of the blade with a second, invisible blade if I wanted.</p>

<p class="cnM4M2Q1YjZkYWQ4OTRkNDZiY2RjMjQ2Yjc0MmM2MjEw" style="margin-bottom: 0">As soon as the last component clicked into place and everything felt secure, I clipped the saber to my belt and began packing. I had taken one of my free evenings to leave the Jedi temple and do a little exploring of the local shops, once the money started coming in from working with master Dyas. Given how <em>woefully unprepared</em><span style="font-style: normal"> I had been on Ilum, I wasn’t going to make the same mistake again. So I’d bought a few things.</span></p>

Inside, was a small med kit and some survival supplies, </span><span style="font-style: normal">a few light toiletries,</span><span style="font-style: normal"> with room to fit a couple of changes of clothes. I stuffed two sets of robes, underthings, and extra socks in, along with a thicker over robe for if it got cold, and a dark poncho to deal with rain.</span></p>

I had been camping a few times in my youth in Japan, while large portions of my time in the German Empire was effectively one long ‘camping trip.’ I had plenty of experience learning what essentials to bring and what I could cut out. So when I’d visited stores dedicated both to high end </span><em>recreational camping</em><span style="font-style: normal"> and </span><em>actual pioneers</em><span style="font-style: normal"> moving out to settle some new planet, I’d been amazed at some of the space-age options available.

As I worked, he spoke. “There are several factions on Dathomir, many clans, but the group we most often make contact with are the Witches of Dathomir, or Daughters of Allya. They are essentially the local equivalent to Jedi given that they are descended from the exiled fallen Jedi, Allya. We will be visiting the various clans and making contact, learning what we can, and extending the hand of friendship.”</p>
