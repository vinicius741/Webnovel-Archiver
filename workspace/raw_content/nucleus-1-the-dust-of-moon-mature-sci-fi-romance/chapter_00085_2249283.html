<p class="cnMxNzAyNDBjZmMwZDQxMTliYjZjOTk2MjUzMDgwMDYw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><strong>13:30, March 5, 2287</strong></span></p>
<p class="cnNiMWFlZDI2MjhhZjQ0MjdhNGZmMjhhNmFkMWYyMGQ4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Öresund District, Lund, Sweden, Nordic Commonwealth Territory</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMjI3MWMwMGM4NDQ5NGRiOGQ1YzQxYzAyYjk3ODFj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The cold hit her like a slap. The snow whipped at her face, stinging her cheeks and eyes.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OGY1NDdlMzM4NjRmZDNhYjUwODQ2ZTllYjUyZjA3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Her feet pounded the frozen ground, the icy wind cutting through her skin. She had stopped Thorin — had she been wrong? Could she have just made everything worse?</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YTE4YmNkMzIxYzQxZjU4N2EzM2MxMjIxNDE4MDUx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Her Quantum Watch beeped, showing a message from 'Erik Lindberg', but she ignored it. The snowstorm blurred her surroundings into a white void.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MDhkYTUzYTViYzQ4MGNiZTI2OWE4ZjFhYjNhODg5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A gust of wind nearly knocked her over, but she pushed through, focusing on the path ahead. Her mind raced.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNjZhZjkyMzViNDRjZjNiNDQ5MzI5ZTNmOTg2YmFi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A soft, glowing figure appeared in the distance. Her heart skipped. Ysolde. It had to be her.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZTZmZjMyNDNhYzQxMWY4ZmU4M2EwMDUyOGUxOWZj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Sigrún stopped, her breath catching as she stared through the storm. The snow lashed her face, but she didn't move. The figure stood still, hunched over, with an eerie light cutting through the blizzard.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MjZkZGQ2MTk0NzRiYzdhZmEyZTI2MzMzZTNmN2My"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Ysolde?" she called, her voice shaking over the storm. Her hand trembled as she reached for the Pendant of Mánagrát around her neck.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZjIxMTFiM2U2NDRmNjBhZmU5MTYxYzU2NjA1N2Yy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">But then a cold realization hit her.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Yzg1NTRhNWFjMTQ5ODk5MGJkZWE0MjBjNjlmOGY5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">It wasn't Ysolde.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OTQyMDU0N2RmNDQ4MmI4YTVjYWVjZWQxYjE5ZmYw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The blizzard parted, revealing a silhouette that made Sigrún's breath catch. Something far more sinister.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTdjY2VhN2Y5NTQ1MWY5ZjBkMGMzODQ1ZjJjMWEx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A towering figure appeared, lit by an otherworldly amber glow. It looked like a giant mutated octopus the size of a hover bus, floating in the air. Its black skin absorbed what little light remained, its arms moving with alien grace. Burning orange eyes locked onto Sigrún.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MGM0MDQ1OTRmZDQ3NTNhMzI4MTYxYTJlMTkzZGIy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Sigrún's heart hammered against her ribs. She was alone. Exposed. Prey.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMzllNWQ2NzM2NjRhMDhhOWEyNmYzZTM0YzRlMTZl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I'm delighted that Carlen fell for the trap and kept Thorin occupied," The being's voice, both feminine and coarse, cut through the storm. "And now we have an Omdal heir wandering through the snow, all by herself!"</span></p>
<p class="cnNmY2ZmODZmZjZmNjQwYTNiZWMxN2Y1MzkzMmJmNTNl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Sigrún tensed, fight-or-flight instincts kicking in. "Who are you?" she demanded, voice shaking.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjODJlZDk1MTNhMDQzMjY4OGQyODYzNjI0ODMzN2Vh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A low laugh. "I am Hafgrim, child, an elder Kraken in service to the Hivemind."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYTIyY2JhZjc5OTRkOTdhZTEzNDA0ZmY4OTIwY2Ex"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Arms reached closer. Sigrún stepped back, boots crunching in the snow. Her mind raced, looking for escape, but seeing only endless white.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYWNiNjc3Y2NkYzRkOGViYjRhYzAwYjUxMjhjM2Zk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Ice formed in Sigrún's veins. Father. Three years since that departure at Oslo, and still missing. Now his legacy painted a target on her back.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ODY1NDVmMjg1ODQyMzZiZTc5NjYwZDFkYTI0NTM4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"What do you want with me?" Sigrún reached for a weapon she didn't have.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZjQwMjkxOTAwNzQ3MjRhZDM4YTg5N2Q0OGFmODAx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Hafgrim's arms lashed out, quick as lightning. Sigrún ducked, feeling the rush of air above her. Her heart pounded in her ears.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NjFmOGIzMDUzNjQ1YjhiZDM4Y2RhNmFjYzA1MjBi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Same as Sven and Ysolde. Your bloodline carries power," Hafgrim hissed. "Power that would not flourish in human hands. I'm here to collect you all and take you home."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MjBmODM2M2ZjZjRiMDA4MTk5NWZhZWY2ZWU3Yzcz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Sigrún's mind reeled. Power? She'd never felt powerful, only abandoned. But now, with death looming before her, something sparked inside.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MTBkZDhhNDVhNDQyODBhYzUwZmU3Y2YyY2FhOGRk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Stay back!" she raised her hands, trying to turn that spark into flame. "I…I know spells! I could kill you!"</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMTY3YjQ4YTdhMzQwM2Y4OWRjZDQ3YjhiMmQ0MmIy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Hafgrim's laughter echoed across the frozen exterior. "Oh, little Nordling. You try too hard."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNjk5YWE2NGRlZjQ0NmViMzFhMzhjNDZlMGZmYjFl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"<em>Gravitas, Abesto!</em>" Sigrún chanted as a bolt of blue energy shot from her fingertip.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZTRjY2E4N2U1ODRkNmE5ZTYzYzY3MTFmYzBiZTNl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">But before it reached Hafgrim, the Kraken simply waved an arm and the energy ball vanished.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MmQwOWM1YjAyNjQ3YjU4MmM2OGY5MTUzNDcxZjk4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"No..." Sigrún stepped back, trembling from despair.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YTQ3NGJkNzlhYzQ4Y2JiMzQ4NjhlZmZiNmRjZGU0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You see, that Ordovox spell isn't meant for offense," Hafgrim taunted, orange eyes gleaming. "But worry not, you need not cast many spells in the Hivemind's plan. Once made into a Hundkynda, your purpose will be clear."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkODVjNmUyNDVlMTQwZGE4ODA3NDJkN2Y0NDIyYjAz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"<em>Glacies Lunae Fulgur!</em>" From somewhere behind, a measured voice intoned.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyM2Y1YjBlMjk2MDRjNDM5M2EyNzg2N2M5NzIyZmZh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As Hafgrim's black arms surged forward to strike, a blinding flash of blue light erupted between them. The Kraken screamed in pain as it recoiled.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTk4OWJkNDllMzQyMTA5NzE1YzUxOGQ1NTRlYjlh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Sigrún's eyes widened as a familiar figure appeared -</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMjQ5MzhiODk5ZjQ0NGRiY2QwMTI3M2Q2N2JmYzk4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A pulse of energy snapped through the air, lighting up the white wasteland. A Valoran elder stood with unwavering composure, surrounded by blue psionic energy. His white coat remained clean despite the storm, as if the snow dared not touch it. His wire-rimmed glasses reflected the blue aura surrounding him, and his silver hair gave him an air of authority.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ODlmNzNhZjcxZTQxMjhiYjMwNjEyYWU2NmU5NWMx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Behind him, two figures clad in white trench coats emerged from the blizzard, their hands already tracing patterns in the air as they prepared defensive positions.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNmVhZGQyZmQxOTRlZmViNzRjZDgzM2U5ZDE4NWE5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Step away from the student, Hafgrim," The elder commanded, his voice cutting through the howling wind. There was no emotion in his tone, only certainty.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzY2I1NmI1NWNmYzQ5N2ViMjNiNmI5MTE0MGNmNTBi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Sigrún's heart raced. Relief mixed with confusion. Who were these Valorans? How had they found her?</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZjhmYTljZGMyYjRlNDc4NzU3NTJkMDU5MTRiZTNl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Hafgrim's eyes narrowed, glowing like embers in the storm. "Artak Otis and his Psi Lynx pets!" The Kraken's arms writhed. "Has the Terra Alliance come to slay Harald's girl?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NjA3NmM2ZTQ0NDRmY2M4NTg2ZDdkMWQzODk1NjM5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You're mistaken," Otis replied, his hands moving precisely as blue energy gathered around his fingers. "We're here to protect Sigrún."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNmU5YTQ4M2QwODQzZDlhYTZmYjFmYTg4OGM0NmE1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Your corpse shall be delicious." Hafgrim countered, arms spreading wide.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOGIyMjdiYmNjZDQzM2Q5ZGRhMWU1ZDhhYWI2Nzkz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Otis's expression remained calm, but his eyes held calculation. "<em>Corpus Lucidus Fiat.</em>"</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOTg4YjUzOGQyNzQ0ODBiY2E4YzNhNDZhNTk5YTll"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The air around him shimmered as blue energy flowed over his form like water. His movements became fluid, almost weightless.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjODJmN2U4NzRjMTQyNTNhMDg2M2IxMDY3ODNkNWVk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Hafgrim lunged, arms whipping forward with speed.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZTBmNjE1MDAyODRiYmE4ZTA1OTllZDM1ZDU4ZjAw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Otis didn't flinch. "<em>Scutum Lunaris!</em>" A blue light barrier appeared, deflecting the arms with a thunderous sound.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3N2VmNzNmMWFhNjQ0ZWRhNGY0YTkzMGE0ZTA5NDQ0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The air crackled as Otis and Hafgrim clashed, psionic energy meeting writhing arms. Sigrún stepped back, overwhelmed. The elder moved with precision she'd never imagined, every movement calculated, every defense timed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYzgyYzZmMTYxMTQwNmI4MjkxOTE2MzU5NTdlNjkx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Hafgrim snarled, her massive form pulsing with rage. "This girl is destined for greater purpose than your pitiful Alliance."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNGIxOWZhN2MzNzRlZGU5ZjFhOWQ2NzNiYTgwOTVl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"<em>Fulmen Argentum!</em>" Otis countered, silver lightning erupting from his fingertips. The bolt struck Hafgrim, causing her to shriek in pain.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZjE5MDA1NGJhNTRjODFhMmFkY2FjOGFjMzVmZmI0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Miss Fjeld!" one of the Psi Lynx agents called, a woman with shoulder-length brown hair and sharp features. "Come to us, quickly!"</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MTA2MDBkYWUxZDRlMjVhOTNkYTQ0ZTdkYTk1NmQz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">But Sigrún hesitated, transfixed by the battle. The Director's display of power was mesmerizing – each spell executed perfectly, each movement efficient.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhM2JkYzI3ODkxYjRmYmU5YmIwNzRkMzBhYjg5NjFk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Hafgrim, sensing Sigrún's hesitation, changed tactics. "Tell her why you're really here, Otis," the Kraken taunted. "About Project Europa."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYWM4NDJhZWY3MjQzZjZhMjAwZGI1ZDE2YTcyMTc2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Otis faltered for just a moment – enough for Hafgrim to strike. An arm lashed out, catching him across the chest and sending him flying backward into a snowdrift.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYzljYjg0OTc4YzQyYjRiZDhiYzUzOGMyNTYyZTk0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Director!" a Psi Lynxcried, his own spells flaring in response. "<em>Fulmen Arg —</em>"</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NTFhYzc2OGZlYjQ4MWNhMjE5YWQyODBjOTYzYzZh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">But the black Kraken was faster. With another arm, she grabbed the Psi Lynx by the neck, silencing his spells as she inserted another arm into his mouth.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZGJiYzljZDJjZjRmYjM4YTZmYzA5M2ZiMzgyZmE2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Sigrún's blood ran cold. "Project Europa? What does my father…"</span></p><span class="cjhlNzgwOTc0NjBiNDRmNTc4YTgzYTZkMDAyOTgwYWM4"><br/>If you stumble upon this narrative on Amazon, it's taken without the author's consent. Report it.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM1ZWZkMTYyN2U0ZTQ4YjZhY2YyMWJjMzg3YzFhMGRm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Otis rose from the snow, his white coat now stained with blood spreading across his chest. His face showed no pain, only annoyance as he drew out a vial of Medi-Vap, inhaling from it to heal himself.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMmM3ODQ5OGJhZDRmYmFhZmU5OWIwODJjMjAxOWMy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Psi Lynx held by Hafgrim attempted to struggle, but his spell could not come as the Radi-Mon choked him.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNmRlMDJhMWY5YzQxYjNiMGQxMWE2MTg3NjMyNGFm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"<em>Passus Transitus,</em>" Otis intoned, teleporting to Sigrún's side in a flash of blue light. His voice dropped to an urgent whisper. "Your father's research is complicated. But right now, your safety is paramount."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYjEzZTI1OWVlNDQzYjI5ODQxNmYzYmJiYzRmOWNh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Despite his calm voice, Sigrún could see the strain in his eyes, the slight tremor in his hand as he reached toward her. This wasn't a man who rushed into battle; this was a strategist.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMmE5ZjNhNTlkYzRjY2VhZTgyMzcxMzIzNTYxM2Vl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Why should I trust you?" she demanded, even as Hafgrim's arms began to surround them.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOGNiYzdjNDJhYzRlOTM4OTJkMGM4NTFjMmYyODM5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Because I can offer you what you need," Otis replied, his eyes on hers. "A new identity. A fresh start. Protection from creatures like Hafgrim – and from those who would use you."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MmIzOTZhYzY1MDQ4YzRiYjQzMjgwNjVlNzYyNTQ3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Before she could respond, Hafgrim struck again, multiple arms converging on their position.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTYyMWIzZGI3YTRjZmRhOWQ3NzZkYTI0ZmQzNTgx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"<em>Fulmen Argentum!</em>" Otis raised his hand, unleashing another bolt of silver lightning. The spell hit with devastating force, driving Hafgrim back with a shriek of pain.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYzYwNTkxNjE3YTRiYWM4YzM1NzVhYzc3NDJlYjMw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As the battle raged on, Sigrún felt that spark within her growing stronger. Power thrummed beneath her skin, begging to be released.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZWZhZGYxMjJiZjQxNDNhOWY5OTc5YjYwNzE2ZTYy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Raising both hands, she pointed them at the Radi-Mon. The incantation that came barely felt like her own words. "<em>Glacies Lunae Fulgur!</em>"</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNDk1NjhhMzc1OTQ0MDdiYjAyY2NiNWI0NDhhYTY4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">From the space between her palms, a blinding orb of pale blue energy erupted. It surged towards Hafgrim, crackling through the air. The blast struck her directly, sending a shockwave that momentarily silenced the storm.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTJlNDg3YzBlYzRmMWE4YjJlZTIyN2Q2NmJiN2U5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Kraken screamed, her arms recoiling from the raw power, the orange light in her eyes flickering as she staggered back. Her skin bore dark scorch marks, with smoke rising from where the lightning had burned her.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNjgxMGRkMWE0NzRmNjhhYzM2MjY4ODg1NjVjYjNh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Savor your victory, little ones. This is not over." Hafgrim's chilling laughter echoed as she faded into the blizzard, her form dissolving into the swirling snow.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMTEzY2IyY2M5YjQ0ZmNhNmE5NmM5MjI0NmVmMTQ5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The clash of energies subsided, leaving only the wind's howl. Sigrún stared at the empty whiteness where Hafgrim had vanished, her heart pounding with the certainty that this retreat was just a pause.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZGY4ZTQyOTI4OTRjZDBiNWY3YzU4ZTVjOTUxM2Q0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Otis turned to face her, his once-perfect posture now slightly hunched from the battle. Blood stained his white coat where Hafgrim's arm had struck, yet his expression remained composed. His sharp gray eyes studied her behind his glasses.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YzZhMWVjMGFjZjQ2ZmViYmM5YjAwZjNmN2YyMjU4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Kraken will return with reinforcements," he said, his voice level despite his injuries. "We need to move quickly."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMzZlMGYyNmJmYjRlMjBiZjY2ZDEyZGNjOTk1ZjQ5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Sigrún took a wary step back, her hand reaching for the pendant around her neck. "Why are you here?" Her voice hardened. "And why would the Alliance care about one Nordic student?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjE0OWQ4ZWM5OTQ4ZmU4YjI0M2ZkZTZlMDJiZmM2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Otis adjusted his glasses. "We've been monitoring unusual psionic activity in the Nordic Commonwealth. Your encounter with Officer Carlen triggered our sensors." His expression remained impassive. "But let's be honest. We've been looking for Harald Omdal's daughter for some time."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMzk4OTY1YzI4ZjRhNjdhOGM3YWUyZmIxMWQ4YzY2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"My pa?" Alarm rippled through her. "What do you want with him?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYmIxNTEyMWZkYjRjMjNiY2Y0N2E1NzQ0MzYxOWEy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"It's not what you think," Otis replied, his eyes never leaving hers. "We're not the enemies your father believes us to be."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZWNmYmNmNGM1YjQzNTM4MTRiZGY1NmMyYmE4ODdj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Really?" Sigrún's voice dripped with skepticism. "Is that why Alliance vessels dump their Helionite in our fjords, poisoning our land? Why your corporations bribe our politicians?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDJlMzk3Yzk5OTQ4ZjNhMzYzZGM0OGU1OTU4MjYz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A flicker of something – perhaps annoyance, perhaps respect – crossed Otis's face. "The policies of the Alliance and the actions of its warriors are not always aligned. We SIMU operate with... a different philosophy in mind."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZTY3ODgyMGM3YTQ5OTViYTlhYTg5NjczMWRkNjdk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"SIMU?" Sigrún's sapphire eyes narrowed in confusion, raising a golden eyebrow.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyY2UwZTI3YjQ4ZjQ2ZGM4N2I0MTlkMjlhZTkxYjU0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Stardust International Mobile Unit." Otis gestured with a hand. "The first and last line of defense against these Radi-Mons you've seen today."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZmM4YmU5NjgxZDRhMDE5NWU1ZWY4ZTJiZWMwN2E2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">One of the Psi Lynx agents approached, voice urgent. "Director, we need to move. Scanners show multiple signatures converging on our position."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMjRhNDk3ZTlkZDQ2MGFiOTlkNGUzNzk0NDUxOTM2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Otis nodded. "Sigrún. I understand your distrust. But right now, creatures like Hafgrim are hunting you. The Nordic Commonwealth is falling. These are facts, not Alliance propaganda."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMzMxYWRjOTRmMzRkZTk4N2E3ODhiZTA1YzIxNmJm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Sigrún glanced around at the endless white wasteland, knowing he was right about that much at least. "What should I do now?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOGVkYTFhZTM3NjQ4MTFhMzNkZTIxYWZiYjkyNTli"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Come with us. Let us to get you somewhere safe, somewhere beyond Hafgrim's reach." Otis's voice remained neutral, stating facts rather than making an emotional appeal. "In exchange, SIMU will dedicate resources to locating your father."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0Mzc1ZWQ2ODIxODQ0YzFhM2I1NzdjZDNhYjY0YWM3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You don't know where he is?" Sigrún asked, surprised.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZjJiNjMwZDgyZTRhMWZhYjY4ODIzOWQ3ZmIxNWJl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Harald Omdal has been...elusive. Even to us." A junior Psi Lynx nearby chimed in. There was a grudging respect in his tone. "But we have resources, Ms. Fjeld. Resources that could help find him – if that's what you want."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMTQxNTZjYTM3ZDQ1ODVhMGEwZDYwOTNkNWRhOWVh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Sigrún's mind raced. Her father was missing, creatures were hunting her, and the Commonwealth was under attack. As much as she distrusted the Alliance, her options were limited.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZTBlMGRhYjYwYzRiNThhMTI2Nzg4OTRjMjkzZDZh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I know nothing comes free from the Alliance. What would you want from me in return? "</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYjM2MjNjYTBlMjQyYjQ5ZDU1NjNjYjUwZmQ2MjM3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Otis's expression remained neutral. "Your abilities. Raw, untrained, but with potential. SIMU could use someone with your talents."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMGE4MGNhMTA2YzQ4YzBiMGE2YWY2OTg3MmQ3ZTE3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"To fight your wars? To be your weapon?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYTJhYzY2MzdjZDQwYTk4MjM4OWYwZmIzMWJiYjk1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"To help protect the Five Realms." Otis corrected. "The threat these Radi-Mons pose extends beyond political boundaries. Your father understands this, even if he disagrees with our methods."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYmY5NzgzMzczOTQxOWNhMDNhYzUxYjQ3MzM0OWFj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The pendant felt warm on Sigrún's neck, almost as if responding to her turmoil.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNzBkNDI3M2Y1YzQ3YzhhN2M3OGFhZDRjNTY1N2Vj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I'm not joining your SIMU so easily," she said firmly. "I've been saving money for years to go to Europa after graduation. To find my father on my own."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYjg5ZTM3NmZjZjRjZGJiYmY0MDhjMGY1OWM3NWUw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Otis's expression shifted slightly. "Europa?" There was something in his eyes—knowledge, perhaps concern.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYTdiZjkzOGQ3ZTQyMjI5NTgyOGM0ZjBkMDdjMzY1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yes, Europa," she repeated. "I have information that my father might be there."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNTBiMGU1Mzc4YjQzMTliYjllMWQ3YWYwNGQyNTUx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Ms. Fjeld," Another Psi Lynx said carefully, "There are...complications regarding Europa that you may not be aware of."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNmRmOWNhOThkMjRiNTY4N2UyMmM2ODNhMzIzZWQ0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Sigrún crossed her arms. "What complications?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZGFjNWU4NGNhMjRlODZhNDBmNDg0MDA5ZGQwZDg0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Since the Jǫkull Horde's emergence, the moon's been largely abandoned by all sides: Directorate, Imperium, and us." Otis explained. "With local crime rates increasing, traveling there is ill-advised."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MTViYWM0YmZkODQ3M2I4Yzg2MTVjMGEyN2FjYzhm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Well, it's where Nordlings like me go to." Sigrún said, placing a hand on her chest.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiODViM2UzODMwYTQzNWY4NThmNGNiZWU2ZTkyZmQ4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"It's not that." A Psi Lynx added from the side. "There's been growing hatred towards the major houses on Europa — the Solheims and the Omdals. They think you're to blame for creating the Radi-Mons."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YmIyZWRmZTdiMzQ4MmQ4NmVkMDUzNzVkYWFiMzE4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"So what do you suggest?" she challenged.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMzI0ZDc3MzhmZjQ5ZTRhNTE1NmJkMzM4ZmU4Nzk1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"SIMU has resources far beyond what you could access as a civilian. Intelligence networks, military-grade technology." Otis adjusted his glasses. "And the ability to establish a new identity. One that'd allow you to move without being hunted."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MjU5ZGYwNGRkZDRjZGNiYzRlNmRlYjljNTRiZDMx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"A new identity..." Sigrún echoed, uncomfortable with the concept.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Yjg3YTc4NmIxZTQzZTZhNTg4NzAzYzYxMDEwZjc5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Your father is hunted because of the Omdal name and what it represents." Otis said. "As his daughter, you inherit that target. But with a different identity, you could search for him without drawing the same attention."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOWQ4MDhjOGMwODQ0MjQ4ODdiMzlkNGQwMDUyMjdh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"And what name did you have in mind?" she asked, suspicious.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NTUyNGU2ZmZkMDRhYWY4MzJjNzM1N2Q5YTBmNjNm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Otis reached into his coat and produced a small data chip. "We've been monitoring several potential psionic talents across the Nordic Commonwealth."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZTU3MzVjNGQ1ZjRlYmU5MDNiMGUzMTgxM2MzNzE0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"What's left of it." Sigrún added sadly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZWExYmEwYWU2ODQ4ZGNhNTkyNDA0OTQ3NTlkZGFh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"When we detected your abilities, we prepared contingencies." He handed her the chip. The name 'Lorna Weiss' was etched on top of it.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OWVmOGQxODE1NDRjYWZhMGRjMjg4YzI2NGIzY2Uz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Sigrún took the chip, studying it with curiosity and wariness. "An Valoran name?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMmQyY2YwYjI2MTRhNmE5NjViOTA2MzY5MTNlY2Y2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"A Valoran from the German American sector. New Savannah on Osram," Otis clarified. "No connection to Scandinavian heritage. No link to Harald Omdal. A clean slate."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NDBiNTcxOTk0ZDQwZDhiN2YwN2FkNzFiYjE0Nzhl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You had this ready before you even met me," she said. It was not a question, but an observation.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNzAzOTlhYzg1MTQ2MDM5OGEzOTliOGI2NTEzZDMz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"We believe in preparation," Otis replied simply. "The identity is complete—documentation, history, and a suitable accent program for you, should you choose to receive one."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiY2MwNDMzNmY1MTQ1NTBiMjlmMzcyOGQ5ZWQ2MzI2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Sigrún's fingers tightened around the chip, feeling its weight. Her other hand traced the pendant on her neck as she looked down on it. "This pendant...my father gave it to me. He said as long as its blue jewel shines, I'll know he's alive."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNGVmNzg2OTc4NTQzMGFiYmE5NDFlNjQ2NTE4YWRj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You can keep it," Otis said, his tone softening slightly. "Personal effects aren't a security risk if they aren't traceable."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNjA2YzNiYjUyOTQ0YWU5N2Q3ZGRiYWRiNmVkOTU3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The pendant seemed to pulse in her hand, its light steady despite the howling wind around them.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOTIwNzA3NTllZTQyYjhhZDIyNTllOGRiYjU0OTU5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She thought of her original plan: a one-way ticket to Europa, searching alone with limited resources and knowledge. Then she considered SIMU's offer: protection, resources, training, and a path that might actually lead to her father.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMDI0NzdiYmZkMjQzNmI5ZTZmODIxYzYzNWI2MmIz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I accept the identity," she said finally. "But I have conditions."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZDE1ZTkwYzY5ZTRkMDFiMjE3NWNlNDZkYTMzMTM5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Name them," Otis replied.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMTRhYmY2MGIzMjQ3NjFiZjY4MGMxZWJmYzE2ZDVl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I want access to all your intelligence on my father. Full transparency about your work and what you know about my father's last known location." Her voice hardened. "And I want your word that — if we find him, you won't harm him."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNWUyZDhjZDk1OTRjOTJiMjQxOWYxNGZlMmM4YWE5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You have them." Otis replied without hesitation.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlM2E1NTgzYmM0MjQ5NWVhYzEzNzg5ZDUwMGI3NWJi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Okay," she said, the word feeling heavier than it should. "I'll be Lorna Weiss. But I'm doing this to find my father, not to serve the Alliance."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NTAyZWJjZmI3MzRiZTE5ZWNjMDc1ODIyMzk3MWE1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Understood." Otis replied, his expression unreadable as he turned to walk. "Survival first, Lorna. The rest can be negotiated."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOTU4OWU1NDc1ODQ4MzU4MTZlYjIyOWFmMzg4ZDZk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"StarWhale V2-15, we're prepared for pickup." A Psi Lynx announced close by as they followed behind Otis, her tone sharp as she touched her own cheek, digits pressing against some unseen spot in her ear. Sigrún found the gesture unfamiliar but somehow reassuring.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMGM4MDQ0ODljNjQwZDVhNGM1OGEyN2JhNDFkODZk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As they moved through the storm toward a cobalt blue shuttle that emerged from between the clouds and descended towards them, Sigrún felt the weight of her decision settling around her.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMWJiZWJhYTFjMTRkYmY5Y2U2MDgwY2MwNWZjMGFi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna Weiss. A name that wasn't hers, a mask to wear while she searched for the truth.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNDM4MzI3ZmZmOTRhOGY4YjQwNGM5ZjFhZmMzZjBk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Her fingers trembled slightly as she raised her left arm, the Quantum Watch's holographic interface hovering above its dial, glowing blue against the white storm. Her thumb paused over the 'Finalize Payment' notification from Jupiter Transit Authority for a moment. Three years of her life, 69,850 Atomic Dollars, all for that one-way ticket to Europa.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OTFhZjRhZDUxMjQyZmVhNGVlZjVlZTZkZGYxZDcw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">With a single swipe, she opened a different option instead. 'Cancel Reservation.'</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOGI5ZWI4NmQxNTQ2MTRiZThmYzFiODRhMWMyN2Rl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A dialog appeared: 'This action will refund your 5,000 AD deposit minus a 500 AD processing fee. Proceed?'</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMmVmNzVhNzY4NTQ0MGM5YzdkMDFjYTA1MGI2OTQx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Sigrún tapped 'Confirm', watching as years of planning disappeared in a simple transaction notification. The blue glow illuminated her face for a moment before fading back to standby.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhODM1ZDRhMDgzZDQ3OWJhMGRjYTVkY2FiNTcxMGFh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I will endure," she vowed silently. "I'll find you, Pappa. No matter what it takes."</span></p>
