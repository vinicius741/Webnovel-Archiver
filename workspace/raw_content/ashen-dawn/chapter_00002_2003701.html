<p class="cnM0YzkyOGJhMGUwMzRlZWQ5YmQ1MTJmMjhmOTFiYTk4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo dragged his boots along the dusty path. This was the type of small town he favored over the loud and boisterous cities they often chose to work in. He didn't need to be told that they held far better prospects than these rundown settlements on the edge of the wastes, but he hated the crowds, he hated the noise, and he hated the attention Commander's reputation brought them. Here they were just another nameless group of mercenaries, and he was only another person strolling through the town at the crack of dawn, the red rising sun just barely peeking over the horizon. Here, Vertigo was just another person passing through, not a known associate of the infamous Commander whose reputation preceded him in every major hub from Sol Merino to the Eastern Plains. The air still held a hint of the night's chill, even as the day's warmth began to spread. The tough jacket underneath his cloak would become too much soon, but he wasn't interested in parting with its protection just yet.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZjJiNDk0YzhkZDRlOTZhNGY2OTZhODVmYzliNDJj"><span style="font-weight: 400">He scanned the town as he walked, categorizing potential threats out of habit. The settlement might be small, but even dusty outposts had factions and power struggles. He'd seen entire towns erupt in violence over seemingly minor disputes. People were desperate everywhere. Some just hid it better than others.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMGI2ZDZmOTU0YjRhOTVhNDMyMGYwZjE5YWI3N2Y5"><span style="font-weight: 400">His eyebrows furrowed together. Some nameless emotion weighed heavy on him, an ache that was growing increasingly harder to ignore. Not loneliness – he'd sought out this solitude, after all. There were thoughts to ponder and nightmares to sort. Being alone was nothing new; while his presence in Commander's corps was valued, Vertigo worked best solo. Being a magical Talent, stronger, tougher, and faster than the average person, there was just so little any of the others could offer him in terms of protection or even assistance. There were of course the other two members of Commander's elite squadron, but they were problematic in an entirely different way.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZWEyZjM4ZjQxNDRiMDRiNjM3MDdjODY5MjViZWIz"><span style="font-weight: 400">This restlessness was less familiar, a sense of being unsettled, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">displaced. </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">The past five years blurred together under the morning light and it all seemed so pointless. Vertigo ran a hand through his hair, a sigh slipping past his lips. Out of pure habit he scanned the horizon with critical eyes, watching for any sign that could potentially mean incoming trouble.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MGY2M2I5MWQzMDRmZDQ4ZjNmMjYxYjMxZDBjZjk0"><span style="font-weight: 400">The hair on the back of his neck prickled in warning. There was a presence behind him, swiftly moving to--</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYzYyNzEyNWJhYjQ1YWRhMWVmNjhmNmM5ZGE0MjUw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo hit the ground hard, the wind knocked out of him. He rolled over onto his back, only to receive a sharp kick to the side. “Bliss! What the f-”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhY2ZkZTk3N2VlYjQ1YzY5MDJhZmZhN2UzNzU4Zjhi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That's for wandering off without tellin' anyone.” The blonde woman crossed her arms, one eyebrow quirked in exasperation. She wore her standard combat gear; reinforced leather pants and vest over a thin shirt that exposed her midriff, pistol strapped to her thigh, chain looped at her waist. Though shorter than Vertigo by nearly a foot, Bliss had a presence that filled any space she occupied.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNmM4MjNlZjliODQ2YWM5ZDgwOTViMjU3NzFhNGI3"><span style="font-weight: 400"> “You keep doin' shit like this,” she continued, “and I keep having to call off the search party to find your sorry ass. Is it so damn hard to leave a note?” She planted her boot on his chest, frowning down at him. “I should totally drag you to Commander's tent and let him kick your ass for all the bullshit you create.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ODg3MzBhNWM2NTRhMTJhMDg4Y2NhMmNkMTJmMGZh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo said nothing, just glared up at her. Her green eyes sparked with that particular mix of anger and attraction he'd come to recognize over the years.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2M2M5ZjJkYjliYzQ5ZjZhM2E1N2QwYWU5NDU1YzVj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So what are you </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">doing</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> out here?” She crouched down, foot still resting on his chest. Narrowed eyes searched his, chin propped on her hand. “There's no bar open at this hour, nobody's gonna be selling food yet and hardly anyone's awake. Thinkin' about robbing someone? You shoulda done that last night while it was still dark.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMmE1NzBlZGU4NjQ2MmRiYThhMjI1MzNkYTE3MzI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">thinking...</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDNjYTNhNDI2YTQyYjk5MTUxYWE2Y2IzZGMyMjAz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heh. You?” She reached up and flicked his forehead. “Well give it a rest or you'll fry your brain.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNWFiNjQxNjFjNTQ3MTY5MzZiYWIzZGE3MWI1YWMz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Bliss...” he snarled through clenched teeth. “Lemme up.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMDM3NjBmZDEwNTRjZjg4ZjhjYTgwOTdhMmY4ZGQ4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shush.” She moved to sit on him, purposefully letting her ample chest brush against him as she shifted her knees to either side. The familiar scent of oiled metal and leather that always seemed to cling to her filled his nostrils. “I expected you'd still be in my bed this morning, and your stupid self is out here wanderin' around doin' who knows what, when you could've been waking up next to me.” She trailed her fingers up his chest, green eyes gazing calculatedly at him from underneath sandy lashes. “I'd've thought you'd be too tired to be up this early, anyways...”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyM2NhMTkxMmQ0NzQyNzQ4NjFmN2EwYzgyM2QyNTNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Memories of the previous night flashed through his mind. Bliss's skin against his, her demanding lips, her hands pulling him closer. The momentary pleasure that never quite filled the emptiness afterward.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NmU1ZjU1NTJiNjRlY2FhYmNjODUzNjA5MDA3YjYy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Grr....” He grabbed her hand as it reached his face and threw her off of him. “Stop that.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNTBlMmRhZGI4ZjRhYWI4Zjc4MTIyMDcxMDBlNzFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Bliss rolled nimbly and landed on her feet, smiling like a fox. “Anyways, Commander's already awake. He wants to see you.” She brushed herself off with exaggerated gestures. “And try not to make too much noise? People are sleeping.” Bliss sauntered away, taking extra care to put a sway in her step that she knew would draw his eye.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NzczNDUzYmVlYjRjMTU5MmY4MDAwNmNhOGNiZjVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Growling to himself, Vertigo hauled himself to his feet and shook the dirt from his cloak. The heat in his palms - a warning sign of his power stirring - had begun the moment Bliss tackled him, and he took a deep breath to calm it. He drew his scarf back up to cover the lower half of his face, what little peace he'd been able to find in the quiet morning utterly gone. His eyebrows knit sullenly together as he turned around and stomped back toward the camp, making sure to give Bliss plenty of lead time.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMjM5NDM4NmZhOTRlZTZiZTRiODY1MjI4ZjMyMDdl"><span style="font-weight: 400">The camp bustled with more activity than the town itself, despite the early hour. Two hundred or so mercenaries called Commander's corps home, a number that fluctuated depending on the season and the success of their recent operations. Right now, they were doing well. The spoils from the last job had kept everyone paid and supplied for months. The soldier on watch nodded to him as he entered the camp, which Vertigo returned with a cursory jerk of his head. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkZjBmMTRjMzc1ZjRiOTZiYjg0MGI0Y2VmYWNkMzM4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Smoke from campfires and cookstoves wafted into the air; solders sat about cleaning weapons, chatting, or sipping coffee. Unlike the regular townspeople, these mercenaries had learned to rise with the sun. In their line of work, sleeping in could be a fatal mistake. Vertigo snatched a chunk of bread as he wandered past the cook's station, stuffing it into his mouth and waving a cheeky thanks without looking back in response to the complaint from the man on meal duty. He made his way through the neat rows of sturdy framed tents, nodding in response to the occasional greeting, and stopped outside a tent in the center of the camp. Unlike the others, this one had been reinforced with wooden supports and extra canvas, making it both more comfortable and more defensible.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwODg2YTllZGM0YzQyNjNhMzc1YjNlMjk2YWFkZGVj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Cautiously, he rapped on one of the wooden supports; he hadn't </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">seen</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> Commander go in there with anyone last night, but that didn't mean anything. Regardless, he had learned his lesson about just barging in long ago, the hard way. “Come in,” a rough voice answered from within.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYmZhOTI5ZDQ3YjRjZDE5OWJiM2Y4OWFiMTUyYzlk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo pushed back the entrance flap and slouched into the tent. Commander sat reclined in a camp chair, a steaming mug of coffee in one hand. Various papers and maps strewed the low wooden table in front of him; Vertigo hardly bothered to spare them a glance. It was a familiar sight and either way none of that was anything he needed to worry about. Commander's boots were also propped on the table, with total disregard for the documents they lay upon.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNjIzZGE0ZmFjMzRhMmRiZDJmOTNiMDg4OWQ4MDU2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Commander cut an imposing figure, even at rest. Tall and broad-shouldered, with a neatly trimmed golden beard and ever-present dark glasses, he carried himself with the easy confidence of someone who expected obedience. Though Vertigo had never learned much about his background, it was obvious Commander had formal training that went beyond what most wasteland militias could provide.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NWE0MmQyNTI2ZjRiNjk4NzZjNmE3OTA1MDM2MjE0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Morning, Vert,” Commander greeted him, raising the mug in salute. “Coffee?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMDY2MWU4NzQwNTQxNjI5MmMwZmEwNmRmYmUxOTZl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No thanks,” Vertigo grunted, shoving his hands deep into his pockets and leaning against the doorframe.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZGQ0YWEyNjI4YjQwMTQ5NzYwZDhlOTcxOWVhZWNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm.” Commander took a large gulp from his mug. The two remained in silence for a moment. “I hear you wandered off this morning,” he said finally.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkY2ZiZTlkY2Y2MjQ1ZDk4OWFhYjZiYTRiZWE3YTcy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo made a noncommittal noise. It hadn't been a direct question.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNDU2OTU1YzY1ZDRkYmQ5ZWY5ZDBlMzI5YjQ0NWE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Commander shrugged, taking another sip of his coffee. “You know to stay out of too much trouble with the locals.” It was half statement, half order.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYzE3YjVkMmI5OTRhNDE5OTZmYjY0MDljNmI3MGU1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yessir,” Vertigo mumbled.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MDBhOTM0NjI2ODRlOGFiMjg2ZGZhYTFhZmYyMjQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Quirking a golden eyebrow at him from over the tops of his sunglasses, the other man chuckled slightly as if to himself. “I'm not asking you for an explanation. It's not as if I'm not familiar with these moods you get into. Hell, I'm practically your father.” He set the mug down on the table and stretched. “And you were such a cute kid, too. I wonder what the hell happened.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmODI2NzJiNjA4NzQxNzM5NmU3N2U5OGI1NGIzMWFi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Familiar with Commander's style of banter, Vertigo just rolled his eyes. It was true enough; Commander had taken him in when he was barely six years old. For better or worse, the man had shaped him into what he was today.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYTZiNWVlODAyNTQ1YWY5ZTE1YzlhMjkxMGIwMWY4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, wander off all you like, so long as you keep things under control. You might let Bliss know once in a while though. You know how she worries.” There was still heavy sarcasm in his voice, along with veiled irritation.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOTIzYTc1YTgyZTQ0YzZiNzFjYjBjZjU0M2Q2MGRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don't give a shit what she thinks,” he replied, even though they both knew it wasn’t fully true.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZGJjMWFjMWQwZTQ0Nzk4NGY1NjQ5ZTFjMTQ2YWVm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Commander chuckled again. “Ha! Well, don't tell her that. Or if you do, do it outside the camp. I'd like to keep everything standing.” He got to his feet and began to pace, hands behind his back, a signal that it was time to get to business. “In any case, I wanted to let you know we're going to move out today. I'd like to see what we can get for our latest acquisitions in Asapaco.”</span></p><span class="cmQ0MTVjOTg5NGZjZDQ3NmJhN2FmZjM5MWY4ZjQxZTE2"><br/>Did you know this story is from Royal Road?

<p class="cnNiOTNiODg4MWI2MTRkNmViMGEzODhmYmM0ZWU5MWZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo sighed internally. The thought of yet another large city made his skin itch. Asapaco was one of the largest settlements left after the Apocalypse, its population rivaling the pre-disaster towns of legend. More people meant more noise, more chaos, more eyes watching his every move.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMTI5MjU3ZDk5ODQxMzBhMjA0YThkYzljODMwMjJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don't give me that look. We could use the cash, and besides...” Commander grinned, white teeth flashing. “Think of all the lovely ladies just pining away for the companionship of handsome, successful men like ourselves! Poor lonely things!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNWQ4ZWM0YzNhNjQ5ZTY4OGFhYmU4YTAwNDkxNjVm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know me better than that,” Vertigo growled. “We're not all into whoring ourselves around.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjM2YzMzExYjMwZTQzMDg4MDY5OTZhODc2MmQwNmY5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You might be in a better mood if you did, hmm?” Commander elbowed him in the arm and dodged Vertigo's return swat easily. “Pack it up. We're leaving before noon today.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNWI1YzA1Y2I0ODQ4OWJiMjUxNDFlZWQ5ZmY2YmJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Disgruntled, Vertigo left the tent to obey. He kicked at the dirt under his feet, already dreading the long trip to Asapaco and the city itself. Three days trapped in a cramped vehicle with Commander, Bliss and Nathan, followed by who knew how long navigating Asapaco's complicated political landscape. Without consciously willing it, the palms of his hands began to tingle and burn. Softly he snarled to himself, sinking his teeth into his lower lip. The sun had fully crested the horizon now and was beginning its long climb into the sky, adding to the heat prickling at his skin. He took a deep breath and willed it to subside. Slowly, the sensation faded, leaving only a lingering warmth. He pulled himself deeper into the shelter of his wide scarf as though for protection, a little tired from the effort, and continued on his way. He passed through the cloth-lined maze of tents, no longer bothering to return any greetings directed toward him.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMDkyNTFhMzYxNjQ3MmFhZjhhODRlODlhNGVmYjM3"><span style="font-weight: 400">The morning's solitude now seemed like a distant memory, replaced by the reality of another mission, another journey, another city full of people who would regard him with fear or suspicion once they sensed who he was. He wanted the dark, quiet solitude of his tent for a moment before he had to think about anything else. As he rounded a corner and saw Nathan leaning against the wood-framed structure, he knew he wasn't going to get it. Nathan was the third member of Commander's elite squad, though at first glance he seemed ill-suited for the role. Slighter in build than most of the corps' fighters, with dusty brown hair and quiet, watchful eyes, he exuded an aura of gentle calm. What he lacked in brute force, however, he made up for in deadly accuracy with a rifle and an almost supernatural sense for trouble. He was also the only one in the corps who could usually talk sense into Bliss when she was in one of her moods. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhYmVhZmYxZTc4NTRhZDZiNWQ1MTgzNmEzNmZmZTRi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey,” Vertigo acknowledged the other man grudgingly, more out of obligation than any desire to do so. “Did you need something?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MzJjMTNhMGE2MzQ0YzFhNTgxNjljNGVhNTI4Yjhh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No,” Nathan responded, “just getting some fresh air.” He hesitated, shifting his slight weight and brushing dusty hair from his eyes, and admitted, “I figured wherever you'd gone, you'd end up back here. What'd you do to Bliss? She went out looking for you and came back a little bit ago grumpy like someone drank her last beer.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjN2YxNGQ1YTIyNzQzNmFhYjk1NjQzYjQ3MTFhZDlk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing.” Vertigo braced an arm against the tent, glaring into the distance. A muscle in his jaw jumped. “She's pissy because I went for a walk instead of staying leashed to her like she wants. If she wants a good little bitch she should get a dog.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNzNjOGEzNWM2NDRlM2E5N2JkMWMxODA1Nzg3ZjA2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh.” Dark eyes troubled, Nathan watched him without moving to go. Vertigo sighed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0Yjc0ZTBlMDg4MTQzOGFhMTU0ZjgxNDc4NTkzZDY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look, just because she bitches to you and she sleeps with you occasionally doesn't make you an expert on how I should deal with her, okay? Back off and let me handle it,” he snapped. “I don't need both of you on my ass every time I take two steps away from camp.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZGNhZGQxMDNjNDQzZmJiOTE1OWY0MmNkMGNmMTMw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I'm not your babysitter. Clearly.” Nathan's voice remained even, though Vertigo could see the tension in his shoulders. “Just trying to let you know that Bliss is acting pissed off. I don't know how you stay together without killing each other.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMTM0ODM3ODQzMDQ5YWViNzEwNDY3MDc5Mjg2Mzlk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo stared at him. “I'm not keeping her from you, Nathan.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMTNlZjFiMzczZTQ0OWY5MWRhMjAyNTNiYmM1YjEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">The complex relationship between the three of them had evolved over the years into something none of them discussed directly. Bliss moved between the two men as she pleased, and while Vertigo knew he should probably care more about that arrangement, he found he couldn't summon the energy.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NTg3NTZkNGM5YjRhNjlhMTA0YTEwZTZlYjkyYWNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Huffing a frustrated breath, Nathan just knotted his brows together. “Vertigo,” he started in the tone of a man who knew he was on thin ice, “Tina's gone. She's not coming back. Maybe you should give Bliss a chance to get closer to you.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZDMxZmU2YjA2YTQyM2Q4NGEzYjUxYzI3YTZmN2Fh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Red shot through his vision and Vertigo grabbed Nathan's arm in a bruising grip. The smaller man flinched. “I don't want to hear that name out of your mouth ever again. Got it?” The heat was back in his palms, stronger now, and he had to fight to keep it from rising to a full flame. “Now are you going to go pack or are you gonna push your luck any further? Commander's gonna be pissed if we're late.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDQ2MjNjNjRiOTQwYzk5ODE0ZDllODEwODg0NmQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Like you're any better.” Nathan yanked his arm free, a rare show of his true strength. “Half the time you don't even listen to Commander.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NjZiYjkyYjYyYTQ2MjlhOTYyZTU2OGE2MzQxNDE0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That's because I don't need him to hold my hand and wipe my ass for me,” Vertigo snapped. “Commander damn well knows I work best alone. If he needed a team player, he wouldn't have chosen me. I follow orders where it counts and that's all that matters.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZGYyN2U3ZDA1MDQzZmFhZDlhZGI2MTVhOTdmODI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Nathan shook his head. “You work well enough with us. That's not exactly alone,” he pointed out.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOGI4ZmU1NTBiYjQ4YmFiNjg3Y2JlMGY4YmQwZjFl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“So I do my thing, and he lets me, as long as we get results. If he wants someone to kiss his ass he's got plenty of options.” Vertigo jerked his thumb toward the larger camp, where dozens of soldiers would happily compete for Commander's favor.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZTE0MDUxOWNjNjQyMDFiMTg3NWY2YmIzMjE3ZTkz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Nathan just sighed and shrugged his shoulders. “I just wish you weren't so damn difficult, Vert, and I know Bliss feels the same way.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYWZhMDI5MWUxMDRhM2JiYWI2ODJkNTk0YTlhNmRi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well,” Vertigo muttered under his breath, “then you can spend the night making her feel better.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NTM1OTg1ZWI2ODQ0NzI5OWU3NjAyZGQ1NzlmMTU0"> </p>
<hr/>
<p class="cnNmNTdjNWQzNmVjZTQ4YzFhZmEwMmZiNzljYWQ4NTIy"> </p>
<p class="cnM5MjQ3Yjg3NjViNDQ5MmM5NmE1OThhNWVhNjBhZTQ4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Asapaco lay nestled in the heart of a river valley, rocky cliffs looming high overhead. Its location, with only one passable road in or out, and the fact that part of it was built right into the cliff made it extremely defensible, and the river provided it with precious resources. Vertigo remembered hearing once that the core of the city had been one of the few places that had weathered the Apocalypse and sheltered some of the tiny, desperate remnants of humanity.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNGUwZjIzZDM2ODQ5ZWNiNTc3ZDc5Y2FjZmE5Mjdj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Three days of travel through the wasteland had done nothing to improve Vertigo's mood. Crammed into a military transport with a dozen other corps members, including Bliss and Nathan, he'd spent most of the journey staring out the window at the barren landscape, speaking only when necessary.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjY2VjYTU4ODcxODQ4YjliMzlmY2RlY2IyYjRkNDk3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo slumped back in his seat. He didn't understand those who were obsessed with pre-apoc lore; it was done and gone, and there was too much to worry about in the here and now. For example, there was just something about big cities that depressed him, and Asapaco was a fine example of its type. All the buildings had been built over and on top of each other again and again, until they were a mishmash of haphazard structures. The occasional awning or stairway was tacked on, and some of the taller buildings did look almost pre-apocalyptic. There was even power and running water to all of the city, a luxury that most settlements could only dream of.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YzNjZDMwOTRlNjQ3NzJhNjk4NWQ5YzExMWE1NWU5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Regardless of his animosity toward the city, he was more than ready to be finished with traveling. The roads were bumpy and dusty and the hard vehicle seats were less than comfortable. His ass was going to be sore for at least a day. The landscape itself was boring and monotonous, filled with dirt and scrub and rocks and not much else, and after three days of constant travel with nothing to do or look at he was covered in dust and going absolutely stir-crazy.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkY2FjNzBjNGIyOTQyMjA5NWU3M2ZiY2RjOWI1MTVh"><span style="font-weight: 400">"You'd think you'd never seen a city before," Bliss commented from beside him, breaking the silence.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNzY0OTQ5NDYwMTQxNjk5YzM3NjZjYmVjOWJlMjQ2"><span style="font-weight: 400">"I'd rather not see one ever again," Vertigo replied, keeping his eyes on the approaching walls.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YWY2NTAyMTY5MTQ0NGI4N2E1YTc3YjVlNGU4NmRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Bliss snorted. "Where else we gonna sell the good stuff?" She patted the crate secured beside her, which contained the pre-apocalyptic relics she'd recovered on their last mission. Her uncanny talent for finding valuable artifacts had made her indispensable to Commander, and by extension, to the entire corps. "Nobody out in the sticks has the kind of cash we need."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDk0MDhiZDJiYTQ0N2Q4ZDVkOTMzYmZlMzI3YzJj"><span style="font-weight: 400">She had a point, though Vertigo would never admit it. The corps needed resources to keep operating, and those resources were concentrated in places like Asapaco, where multiple factions competed for power and influence.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMzVmNmIyZTQ5NTRlYmI5MjEyMDA2YTE2ZjBlMzNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">They drove up to the gate and stopped. Out of reflex, Vertigo pulled his cowl higher to cover the lower half of his face. A man in a city guard uniform that almost but not quite managed to avoid looking cobbled together approached the lead car. Even here in Asapaco's outer districts, where rival factions vied for control, Commander's name carried weight. Commander conversed with him for a moment and a pouch – likely filled with bribe money – changed hands. The gate opened and the convoy drove forward.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlODY5NjhhZTQzZjRjY2Y4MmI4NDBjMjQ0ZjBlMGY1"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Did you notice that?" Nathan asked from his spot across from Vertigo.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNTU4ODlkNTE0YTQzMTViZDlhZjhkMWRkM2RmZWUw"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Notice what?" Bliss replied, still fiddling with her crate.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YWJkZDRjYzgzODQzMGJiNGNkYzdkM2Y5ZThjMGZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">"The guard recognized Commander's name right away," Nathan said quietly. "No questions, no verification."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YWJlMTRiYjc5MTQ1ODliNzg4NTg4ZjBhOGRjNWQx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo shrugged. "Commander's got a reputation."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MzJjNjQ3YmE1YzQwYWE5MDY4ODMwYzE5YWU5MTE3"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Yeah, but normally the Outer District guards make at least a show of checking credentials, especially with armed groups this size," Nathan insisted. "Something's changed since we were last here. Almost like they were expecting us."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NGFjZGYwODMxZTRiMTA5NmMwNGVkNmY3ZmY3MTQ4"><span style="font-weight: 400">The observation put Vertigo on edge, though he tried not to show it. Changes in Asapaco's power structure could mean trouble for their operations. If one faction had gained too much influence, their usual freedom to move through the city might be compromised.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlY2IyNjUxZjVlZjRjYTM5Yzg4NzY5YmE4MzU2ZTRk"><span style="font-weight: 400">As a major trade hub, Asapaco kept plenty of space for large groups to camp out. It appeared that several others were in town; mercenaries, treasure hunters, or in rarer cases both, as they were. There was one particularly hard-bitten encampment of men flying a black pennant from an ornate, evil-looking lance that clearly took their military duties seriously. The sentry on watch glared as they passed by.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span></p>
<p class="cnNlZjUxYzZlZTY4YzRlNjRhYTMyOGY2MzY3NmM0YzMz"><span style="font-weight: 400">The clearing Commander selected in which to set up camp was at least better than camping in the wastes or the wilderness, with water and latrines readily available and a truly ridiculous selection of taverns and brothels. Commander and his officers, including Vertigo, Bliss, and Nathan, received the privilege of bunking in one of the mid-quality inns nearby. The four of them stood in the hot, dusty campground as Commander supervised the unloading of supplies and the trinkets they had for sale. The pre-apocalyptic relics and technology that Bliss had such an uncanny talent for finding would bring them a good chunk of cash. If, of course, they could find the right buyer, which in the constantly shifting political landscape was never guaranteed.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZTIzYzk5MmVkNzQ1MDdiMDA1MDJlYTE4MzlkNGE0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Bliss, why don't you take your treasures and see what you can get us for them.” Commander winked at her. “You'll get your finder's fee, so no need to skim off the top.” Bliss grumbled at him but enlisted the help of two soldiers to unload her jealously guarded cargo. Her negotiation skills were almost as valuable as her talent for finding relics; she knew how to get top dollar for even the most obscure artifacts. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3YzlhMTMwMTI4OTQ3Yzk5MTE2ZTNkYWUzNjRhNzJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Commander glanced back to Vertigo and Nathan. “In the meantime, I'll accompany you two as far as the main square, and we'll split off from there. We'll get the lay of the land since it's been so long, and we'll all meet back here before sundown."</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span></p>
<p class="cnM1Y2FlNTBiNTBkZDRlNzA5ODg0ZjM0YzdjNGQzOGRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo's jaw clenched. He'd been looking forward to a nice quiet afternoon with a bottle of vodka while everyone else dealt with the negotiations and information gathering. Commander looked at him sharply. “Problem, soldier?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYTFhNDUxZDRiMDRjMDE5ZmVkZGEyNWQ4M2EzNTQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No sir,” he bit out, sweeping his cloak over his shoulders to cover his uniform.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMWVlMjNmMjA2NDQ1M2Q4MGZlMjgzYjYzMDdhYTgx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good,” Commander said mildly. “Move out.” Nathan fell in beside Commander, but Vertigo stalked off ahead, cloak and scarf fluttering behind in the wake of his angry strides. Let them catch up; he just wanted to get this over with so that he wouldn't miss that date with the bottle.</span></p>
