<p class="cnNjYTExZDRmMDYxMjQyZGViNGZlOTQ1Njc3OTRiYTc1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><strong>08:25, February 10, 2295</strong></span></p>
<p class="cnM0ODllNjljNmVmNzRiNjZhYjBjMDJmMTllYjNjNDZj"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Main Server Room, 117F, Amber Moon Spire (琥月塔), ZenFusion Taipei branch, No. 7, Section 5, Xinyi District, Taipei, Taiwan, Imperium of Dragons territory</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMzU3MWNlOGY4ZDQ0OThhMjBlYTIyNWIwY2RkYTU3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><span style="font-weight: 400">"</span><span style="font-size: 1.5em"><strong>T</strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400">his is Manny. I'm retreating from Amber Moon and making my way towards Rally Point Alpha." In the bean-sized earphone socketed in Lorna’s right ear, Emmanuel Boateng's deep voice came through crystal clear.</span></span></p>
<p class="cnM5NjhlNGJmNzQzNzRkNjZiZTdhNzUxMzMwYzFjMWM5"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Lorna here, still working on my part," Lorna responded through her own earpiece, hearing the faint sound of gunshots on the other end.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MDYwNWQwODk1YzRhNDFiN2MwMjllZmZlOWZlZmQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">She was standing in a chilly room, surrounded by amber-colored tubes and machines that towered over her. Xin sat next to her at a marble table, focused on typing away on an advanced quantum computer that was securely fastened to the table with a plaque reading ‘Cluster 6865‘ on it.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNWVjOWVhNzFlZjQ5NjQ4YTNiMGM4OWEzYTFhNjdk"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">The Main Server Room hummed with the concentrated power of dozens of Zephyrium processors, their crystalline matrices pulsing with ethereal light behind transparent panels. Unlike the ornate displays in the building's public areas, these crystals were purely functional - rough-hewn chunks of raw power barely contained by their quantum-shielded housings. The air crackled with ozone, heavy with the metallic taste that all fusion facilities shared.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZTZmYWNjMzZjNTRmNTJhNDQ4ZTA1MDUzYWQ1ZWNj"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Through the reinforced floor panels, Lorna could see the building's primary Helionite circulation system - a network of luminescent green tubes. The waste product cast a glow across the room's amber-colored walls. Each crystal-powered processor generated enough heat to require its own coolant system, filling the space with a labyrinth of pipes that snaked between clusters like mechanical veins.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZjJkYjVhZWM4MTQ4YzRiNWE1ZDM0MzUzMDgyNzJk"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Careful," Xin warned as they moved between the servers. "The Zephyrium crystals are unstable this close to the building's core. One stray shot could trigger a cascade." He gestured to where the crystals' light flickered erratically, their usual blue-white glow occasionally flaring orange.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNTljNmFkZThkMTQ1Mzk5ZDFjZmJhYjQ4NDc4OGE1"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Do you need assistance, Manny?" Diego Rodriguez's voice sounded over the comm channel.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMGE0NmU2NDdhZTRiNzRiY2IwODY2OWNhNmI0NTlh"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yeah, remember that Helionite sewage system we used to get here from the Songnei Starport? It's blocked off now," Emmanuel replied.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMDAzYWJjOWMxMzRiYzBhNDZlZTExY2ZiODhjZGM0"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"My goodness. Guess plan A just got crossed out, huh?" Diego quipped.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YzkwNmJiZDU1MTQxYjdiY2UxOGE3NmI5MzYwZjRi"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yep. Plan B it is," Emmanuel's tone was laced with amusement. "These Imperium people sure know how to build Quantum Lifts, though. This one is beautiful, fast and sturdy."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyN2NhNDRhODY4MDQxZjM5OGYzOGNmYmNjYjUwOThi"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Alright. How are things going, Lorna? Is the data there?" Diego’s tone remained calm.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZTdiMGZkOTFlOTQ4YmI5YTU2MTAzYzEwY2UzZTQw"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yeah, a local is helping me out," Lorna replied, shifting her gaze towards the small and thin man typing away eagerly on the computer. "Guy goes by the name Xin."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYjlkNGIyMGZlZjQxMDk5Y2FmNjNkMjIxY2QyOWE0"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"I can't hear your friends on the other side, but please say hi to them for me," Xin's gaze remained fixed on the screen as he spoke in a cheerful and enthusiastic tone.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZmM5NjQ3ZGY2NTQ3OTA5NmMwOGYxNWMxM2QwNmVh"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Xin says hi," Lorna smiled as she caught her own gaze lingering on him. It was her first time in the Taiwan province, and in past missions within Imperium territories, most people she had encountered would treat her and her teammates like dirt. In places like Mainland China and the Northern Korean Peninsula, the average Imperial was condescending, detached, apathetic, and emotionless. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkNGM3ZDMzYWVlYjRkNmFiYzJhODVjNTA3YjMyODU5"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">In comparison, Xin seemed different. Lorna wondered if there were more people like him, who still held onto their humanity despite growing up in an oppressive and cruel society.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYTJiODQ0YTZkMjRmNGNhOGJiYzg5MWM5MGE1ZDhh"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Suddenly, a smell wafted in from the stairwell outside the room: a mixture of sweat and burning dust. It was followed by a loud clanking sound of metal armor getting closer and closer.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNjdmYjcyYWIyYTQxZmQ4MDM2NmJiOGY4MDRiNWEy"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Xin, work as fast as you can," Lorna spoke in a hushed tone as her body tensed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MzZjOWYxZjI2MTRlNGY5MjBkYWVkZGEyOWQ1MWIx"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Got it," Xin took a deep breath before continuing his typing on the computer. "The data is in. Just need to delete the local copy —"</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NjMwZmMyZWUzODQ2NGU5ZjZmOWFhMGI3MDBjNmJh"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Stop right there, scum!" A tall, muscular figure in crimson armor stepped out from behind a cluster of tubes, his heavy boots echoing on the metal floor. His face was hidden by a horned helmet, and his large shoulder plates glinted in the dim light. He gripped a massive Thermal Battleaxe with both hands, raising it, poised to strike down on Xin.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNmI3Y2Q2ODUzZTRiMTJiOGI0OTNmMmNjMGY4ZjQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Get down!" Without hesitation, Lorna sprang into action, lunging at Xin and knocking him to the ground just in time to avoid the deadly blow from the crimson soldier's Battleaxe. The attack slashed through the chair Xin had been sitting on, splitting it in half.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNmQ1ZWIxN2VjNzRjMGM5ZDJlN2FhMzQxZWNlMDMy"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Bloodtrooper!" Xin exclaimed as they tumbled to the floor together, he held onto Lorna for support and his cheeks heated up at their closeness. "Thank you."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NTgwYzYxMjNjNzQxMjZhNDgxZDNjNWYwMTEzZTM2"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Use your gun," Lorna instructed calmly as she gave him a smile and pushed him away. She then rolled out of the way of another attack from the Bloodtrooper.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNjEzNmU3NDg1NjRmMmJiYzViYWM0MGM5NTNiMWI3"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Why won’t you die!" the Bloodtrooper yelled in frustration as his weapon cut into the ground, sending sparks flying.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkY2EyYTc3YTEwNjQzZTA5ZGI4MWFjYzc5NDZjZjcw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><span style="font-weight: 400">"</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Fulmen Argentum!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">" Lorna declared as she stood up, her fingers crackling with blue energy as she aimed a spell at the trooper. The attack hit its mark, causing the soldier to freeze in place and collapse onto his back.</span></span></p>
<p class="cnM5MzJiOWM4OTkzYTQ5NmRiZjQ3ZGMxZTgwNGFhMDI5"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna then drew her Psytum Sword and ignited it with a deep breath, feeling her heart synchronize with its glowing core. She approached the fallen Bloodtrooper, aiming for his helmet as she plunged the quantum blue blade right through it. The smell of burnt metal and brain filled the air as she pulled out her sword, victorious over her opponent.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YWRhMTNlZjJjMDQ1MDRiOWVlNDdkMzNkMDY4M2Fj"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">A pair of Bloodtroopers appeared at the entrance, each wielding a Thermal Battleaxe in their hands. One charged towards Lorna while the other went after Xin.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyY2Q1NjI5YjM0NTQwOWU4NjQxOWVlNDJmMDg3ZDQy"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Focusing intensely, Lorna could hear the sound of a 10mm Magnum firing and Xin's frantic shouts in the background. She focused on the approaching Bloodtrooper and dodged low to avoid the incoming axe swing. In one swift motion, she countered with her sword, sending sparks flying as it collided with the soldier's armored torso.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZDQ3MGNhZTExZDRlODQ4ZDhhMTRjNmQyOTcxYmYx"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">She sidestepped and spun around to meet the enemy's attack head on, their weapons clashing in a fierce duel. Despite feeling a sharp jolt of pain, Lorna pushed through and continued to fight. She took a step back and then lunged forward once more, countering with a powerful strike that sent him reeling backward, his helmet cracking under the force of her blow. But he was not down yet.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYzY4NmIxNDczNTQzN2ZiNmEwMTM1MDA3MzNhYTky"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">With a roar, the trooper swung his ax again. With his helmet falling away to reveal the rugged and scarred face beneath, Lorna could see the frenzy in his bloodshot eyes as he lunged forward, aiming straight for her waist. Instinctively, she deflected the first blow and sidestepped the second.</span></p><span class="cjI2ZmQ2NTU5MDBjMzQ0Mzg4MWFjMDM4YWFmODhiMTZj"><br/>Love what you're reading?

<p class="cnMxNzY3Yzc3NjI1NzQwNTJiOGMxMDMyN2NkZTk0MzRm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><span style="font-weight: 400">"</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Pedis Leporis Lunaris!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">" Gritting her teeth, Lorna dodged the third wild swing and lunged forward, planting her boot into the Bloodtrooper’s gut and driving him to the ground as a quantum blue energy surrounded her form.</span></span></p>
<p class="cnMwNmE1Nzk4NTg5YTQyMjhhNDg4MWIyYjI2MDQ3MWQ2"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Lorna Weiss?! Nooooo!" The Bloodtrooper gasped out.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYmVkYmEzNWI1MzQzY2U5OGVlMDBhMTA3N2U4NmU0"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"That’s me, fucker." With a swift sweep of her blade, she severed his weapon-arm just as it began to glow red from quantum energy. The Bloodtrooper roared in pain and fear as he clutched at the stump onto the pavement. Seizing the opportunity, Lorna stepped forward and stabbed him in the head as he fell lifelessly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTJlMGNmOGU0MzRiNjhhYjM3NGE3MmRiNTI0MTE0"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Her gaze darted around, looking for any potential threats as she kept an eye on Xin. He had taken cover behind a large pillar, and beside him lay a fallen Bloodtrooper buried under machinery and tubes. To her surprise, the enemy soldier's armor was shattered and crushed, rendering him motionless. Lorna’s lips parted, but no words came out.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNTk4ZjBkZjdlZjQ1YzZhYWE5NDY5NmY1OTQ0ZDk1"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin looked up at her, his grin awkward. "There's a weakness in these heavy server machines. Their foundations are flimsy and they easily tip over. Shot a few of them to take down that guy."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNmE5ZjlmN2VlZjRmN2RhMjQ5ZDU1OTIzNWJjMWJl"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Clever," Lorna nodded as she deactivated her sword, a melodic hum came from the silver hilt while the energy blade retracted. She felt her heartbeat slowing down and becoming stable as she let out a relieved sigh.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YTcyOTNlNGYyMjRhNjFiMDYyOGZiZWIwOWJiNDBi"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Suddenly, the ground shook beneath them and they both struggled to maintain their balance.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTViMGNkYzAwOTQ3MDM5NWE5OGY5MjE2YjI5NDUz"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"The satellites report sightings of increased police activity in the city. Lorna, have you made any progress?" Diego’s voice crackled through their communication devices.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMzU3MmE1YTQ4ZTRkYjg4ZDE1MjBkZWUxNjNkODc1"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Xin, is the data ready?" Lorna asked as she stepped over the corpse of another Bloodtrooper.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YjhiMjY0OTA0MDRkN2ViZjdkYmMzMzBjZTE5MDI1"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"It's stored on that flash drive over there," Xin replied, getting up and walking towards the broken computer. "It's a shame the computer got destroyed though."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYjdlOGFmOTJiMzQ4ZDdhNGEwYTNhMWFlZjJjNDUx"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"That's fine. Just grab what you can," Lorna said as she scanned the area with her sapphire eyes. "Is there an emergency exit nearby?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMmFjZGEzYjRlMTQ2YTc4ZjhlMTJmOGJmMDBkMzY1"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"There’s one down on level 69, but we’ll have to get back to the stairwell," replied Xin. As he spoke, he retrieved a dark brown flash drive - about the size and shape of a tennis ball - from the computer, pocketing it in his gray prisoner suit before zipping it close.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMjk1MjM1ODM1MDQzZDZiZTVhMjViZTczOWE4NTg3"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Alright, I suppose we can —" Lorna’s pulse quickened as she rounded the corner, only to come face to face with six Bloodtroopers standing in formation, their towering frames dominating the corridor. " — move?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MjAxYzg2NGIwZjQxYTRhYjQxOGYxYjU4NjM3YWU1"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Each trooper was encased in menacing crimson armor, ornate yet brutal in design, with jagged edges and intricate engravings that glowed faintly with a malevolent energy. Their helmets were shaped like the snarling faces of ancient demons, complete with horned visors that hid their eyes but left their cold, unyielding gaze unmistakable. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlNjU1ZDQ0ZDU0ZjRlOWQ4Mjk4MWI0MWE5MGFhZTk2"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">In their gauntleted hands, they each held a massive two-handed battleaxe, the blades honed to a deadly sharpness and pulsing with the same ominous energy that coursed through their armor. The troopers stood as an impenetrable wall of red and steel.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMDRmYjY4NGI0ZjQ3YWI4MTQ5NDgyNDBhNGZmMTgx"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">From between the line of Bloodtroopers, a woman emerged with an air of cold authority, her steps measured. She wore a flowing robe of deep black and crimson, the fabric rich with embroidery that depicted dragons and mythological creatures, shimmering with an almost supernatural sheen under the corridor's lights. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzYWMzZTEwYjE5OTQxNGE4OGI3NzUyMDQ0M2E0ODJi"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">The woman’s hair, dark as midnight, was styled in a sleek updo, held in place by an ornate hairpin adorned with a blood-red gem. Her face was like porcelain, with almond-shaped eyes that narrowed as they met Lorna's with hostility. She stood straight as she declared in a contralto voice. "One more step and you’ll meet your end, Lorna Weiss."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OTRhMTU1OTc4OTQ0ZjVhMTZmMzhmMGZhZjQ0ZjM2"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Do I know you?" Lorna casually asked as the group of crimson soldiers surrounded her and Xin. She slid her Psytum Sword back into her coat.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOWViYTg5NGVmNzQwYTFiMzJiNGNhNjdiMGFiNTFk"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"No, but many in the Imperium Legion know you," The woman in the onyx red robe smirked. "I am Dilinur Altai, senior Conjurer, Blood Mage in the Golden Serpent Circle, and the Thirteenth Prefect in the Taiwan province. You and your SIMU have slaughtered dozens of my comrades."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYTM4MzQwNzYzNTRkNzJiZGFjMWY1OTM1NWMyODQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Right, big shot. Killed too many Imperials on this job, though. Don’t really keep count," Lorna coolly tilted her head.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyODg3M2E4YmRiYTRhZDA5NmI2ZDcxMGJmYWMxODVj"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"But can a Psi Lynx like you really take on me and six Bloodtroopers at once?" Dilinur scowled.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMWM3YTNkNzlhZTRhMzJiNmI5N2E0MDdhZDM5MzFj"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Who knows. What have you heard about me, though?" Lorna shifted her weight from foot to foot.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3M2FlNDg5OWMzMDQwZGU5YzQ3NzU4NjU0Yzc0N2E1"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"You're a filth. Arrogant and promiscuous. You slept with Han, Kuo, and Chang. Killed them all under different names," Dilinur sneered in disgust. "You are the worst kind of human from the Alliance."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMzk5ZjhkY2EzNTQ0ZTY4N2UyNmMzYjQ4YzkxMjEw"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yeah, well, did you know that Han had erectile dysfunction?" Lorna's tone took on a mockingly seductive quality. "He told me it's been like that since he was a teenager. Those rumors about his three sons not being his are true after all."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NmI2NmM0NjI4ZTRjOWE5ZjJkMjM3NjI1Y2ZiZDYw"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">The Bloodtroopers gasped in shock and began whispering among themselves.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZmE3ZjU4MzNjNTRiNGZiMDhlMWYxYTZhYmM4MTIw"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna's eyes flicked to Xin, who had his 10mm Magnum aimed at the Bloodtroopers while standing next to a glass wall. He looked back at Lorna with a dropped jaw, disbelief written all over his face.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZWRmMzlhMWNmYzRlZWI5MGY0ZGZjZDhkMDYwMjky"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Don't listen to this whore! She's a liar and a murderer!" Dilinur silenced her troops with a stern finger before turning back to Lorna. "And today, we will arrest her for great justice."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYjU0MjFmMmQ0ZjRhMjk5ZDdjMmRmZjFmZGRjMDU4"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"This is Thomas. Manny and I have rallied. Making our way towards Songnei Starport. See you there, Lorna," came Thomas's baritone voice through Lorna's earpiece.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMWQ1MmE3ZGNiZTQ3NDI4YTAyMDM0YzczM2Y1ZTg3"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Xin, what's behind these walls?" Lorna kept her gaze on Xin.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ODE1M2U1NmVmNTRiNjRiYzA0YzVhNjhhNzhkZDY1"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Uh, n-nothing. If anyone tries to go beyond them, they'll fall all the way down," Xin averted his gaze as his voice recovered. "But don't worry, I'll fight until my last breath if necessary."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZWY5ZTU5MzAyMTQ2ZmU5ZmFmM2QzNzQ4Mjk0MmY2"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Wu Zhi-Xin, stand down," Dilinur pointed a sharp, ebony fingernail at Xin. "Governor Qin wants you captured alive, but I won't hesitate to kill you if needed."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MjA0ZGUxYTFlMzQ5YTdiZmE1YTMxNjZlZGIxNmQ2"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">With a hopeful expression directed at Dilinur and Xin, Lorna suggested. "Hey, how about this? I’ll walk away, while you guys take Xin into custody. Then, we can all just forget this whole thing ever happened."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMjg3ZGY3N2ViYzRmNzU5NjFkMGJkNDdlNDM2ZmJk"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Very funny," Dilinur responded quickly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OTAzNDVkOWFmOTQ1MGQ5MTk4ZDBhNzNiZTE3YTQx"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">A tense silence filled the room as both sides awaited the next move. As Lorna reached out telepathically to a component inside her pistol - the one that Xin now held - she sensed that there were only 2 bullets left in the 24-shot magazine. Alone, Xin wouldn't stand a chance.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZGEyZjg0M2E4ODQ4ZWRiNjFjMjM4Y2ZkOWM0OTA3"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna's head remained cocked to the side and her tone relaxed as she spoke calmly to Xin, "Alright, Xin. Put your gun down."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOGMwNzQ2ZGVlNjRiMGQ5OWM3YzQ1YmMzZTZjNDQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"No way, I'm ready to fight," Xin protested in disbelief.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkODVkZDBkOWFhNzRjYjM5NDg5MDhkYmIwMmIxZDYy"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Drop the gun on the floor!" Dilinur ordered. "And hands up! No sudden moves."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNGMyZTRhNGYyNDQ1Y2FhZTUwYTZlYjA2OTJkMzM4"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"It's okay, Xin. Just do it," Lorna reassured him as she raised her own hands and subtly turned to face the glass wall next to where Xin stood.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMzk0NTZiNDIyNzQ1MzA5MjdhYWQxMGMzZDE4ZDRk"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"This is insane," Xin mumbled as he reluctantly dropped his pistol to the ground with a loud clank.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYzQzZGZhMjIzYjQ0OWZhNDE2NGMzNTQyNTM2NzY3"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Arrest them both," Dilinur commanded two Bloodtroopers who slowly made their way towards Lorna and Xin, each carrying an ebony steel cuff.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZWJhZDIxMGQxYzQ3OGQ5MDU5MDVkNGI1YzRmOGU0"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"That's right, Dilinur. We surrender to —" Lorna grinned mischievously at Xin before turning to face him. "— gravity."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDliYmFhZjI4YjQzY2U4ZjJkOTNmYjNkMDM0ZDI3"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"What?" Confused, Dilinur raised an eyebrow but it was too late.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NWEwMWJkODk0ZjRlZTE4ODc3OTI3Y2QwMDZmOWQx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><span style="font-weight: 400">"</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Passus Transitus!</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">" Lorna's voice rang out clear and strong as she finished the incantation. A quantum blue aura enveloped her as she lunged forward, passing by Xin and grabbing his wrist. The blue aura enveloping her touched the glass wall and shattered it into pieces that harmlessly flew away from Lorna.</span></span></p>
