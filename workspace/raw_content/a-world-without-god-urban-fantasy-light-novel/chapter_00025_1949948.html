<p class="cnMxYTZkMTBhMzVmZjRjODY4NGY3NjgxMjA0ZTJlZWVm"><span style="font-weight: 400">When I burst through the doors of the Shrine, an unexpected scene was waiting for me outside.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NGNmZTQyNGE1MzRlYWJiYTJiMjNhODc3M2U5ZTM0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hikari and Shiina had barely moved from their previous locations. The angel’s mighty expression had vanished. Shiina, on the other hand, had a rather complex frown, as if she couldn’t really follow what was happening.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OTg4ODRlNTRhZDQ5Y2JhOTFhYmM3OTgyNGVjMjBi"><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason for their grim faces became obvious when I took notice of the archangels. They were still imprisoned inside Hikari’s invisible barrier, but were no longer the only three people inside.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YThhNGViNzU1YTQ3ZGY5ZmFjNDdkMGVjZDAzZTMy"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was someone else there. Despite having logged in, Ayumi was motionless, her gaze facing downwards, and held by Michael.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZjIwMDk5NDk1MzQzOTc5NWEwYWZlMGM3YWQ4M2Nj"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Damn you, AI Assistant! I put my trust in you! You could have put her anywhere, but it just had to be inside the barrier!</span></em></p>
<p class="cnM2YzVhMDkwNzgyMDRkYTU4MmVmN2IzYTFhYmU5NGU2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Moments after I pushed open the doors, everyone’s attention was on me.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNmE5MzQxZDlmYTQzOGM5NWYwODdjNDkzYzkwZTll"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hikari briefly smiled in relief at seeing my not-so-triumphant return.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZGM1M2I5MWMxMTQxMTVhMWM2OWYzMWQ2YzJhMjFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Takeya, I am glad you are all right. Is it fair to assume Ayumi’s reappearance was your doing?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNTRmNzg5Mzk2OTRmMWNhNDQ2NGJmYmQxN2UwNWEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, you could say that. I got a lot of help though.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMGQxODM4OTNlZTQxYzg4MmQ2YjA0NGY0MjBhNzcx"><span style="font-weight: 400">The angel made a questioning look. “Help? From whom?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOGNhNWM3N2NkOTQ3ZTY4NzI4NWIwZjk4YzVkZDIz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s not important. Right now, we need to help her get out of there.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ODQ4Y2E0ODYzNzRmOWRhY2RiMTFiMGMwOTYyYzBi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, that’s going to be—”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNGU2MjA2NDJjNTQ1YjViZWEyYTMyYmM0NDk2YmZh"><span style="font-weight: 400">A scream cut through our conversation.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNGUwNjBlYTkzYTQ1Yzk5ZTc4MTNlNTY2NDFiOWZk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You, brat. You managed to enter the Controller room?” Michael howled. “How did you figure out the password?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MjEzOGUwMTdmMTRjMTk4MWIzZDg5ZGMwYTI5ZWU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">An uncontrollable smirk rose on my face.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OTZmM2U1Nzk3ZjQ3MTQ4ZWMyYTU1MWYzYWFmNGFk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What, that little puzzle? ‘What’s the most important thing in the world’? It’s such an obvious answer. Angels couldn’t answer it because they are all conditioned to just say ‘God’ right away. Only those people who are unshackled by this society could have answered something different. I guess that’s the point of the password, right?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNDZlYjZjZTYyNTQ0ZjQ4MTE3ZWE3YWYyMzYxOGIx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Eh.”</span></em></p>
<p class="cnM0ZGYyNjgyOWZlMjQ1Y2ZhYzJkYTk5Yjk5MmM5NDJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">However, my explanation, instead of leaving the archangels flabbergasted, instead just produced laughter.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOWVhNmRhMjI0ODRlNGI5NjhlMmIwNzRjOWViOGQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eheh. Ahahaha! This must be a joke, surely. Something this funny couldn’t be true.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ODQ2MDhjYmRjMjRiZmZiNjE3OGRmNWY2MGU1MzJj"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">What the hell is he laughing about? What’s so funny?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnMzMGY3ZThjMDVkZDRiZThhNmZkZjdmZmE0MTcxMjBk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let me tell you something, little brat. A little treat for you, if you will. The password is the same for everyone. The AI gatekeeper or whatever it is doesn’t make a different answer for different people.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwM2VmNmIxMTMzNDQxZDM5ODQxZjdkODI1MmExNjc0"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Wait. What is he saying? The answer… is always the same?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNiMGMxMGQwZmQ0MDQ2ZjU5ZDE3YTlkZTczZWMyY2Nl"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">But how’s that possible? After all, the answer…</span></em></p>
<p class="cnM5YWI5MDFlNTA1YzQ1N2I5MzM0YTA1ZWY4M2IwNTdk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ayumi,” the man spat out the word with disgust. “That’s the password. That was the ‘most important thing in the world’ for the creators of the angels.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNmM1YTk2OGFiZDRlNjlhNDE5OWMzZTk2MWNjNTc0"><span style="font-weight: 400">The cold air seemed to freeze in place. No one said anything. Hikari looked at me as if asking for answers, but I had none to give her.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ODc1ZTViYTI4YTQ0Nzg5YWE2YjZkZTlkMTJjZTc5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Raphael was the one who broke the silence. “We were careless. If anyone could possibly have figured out the password, it would have been the brat’s boyfriend. You should have gotten rid of him back on Earth, just to be safe.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZDU0YjI4YjI3ZjQzYzg5NDY4YWRjMmM3MDNjZTkz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“H-How was I supposed to predict that he would meet Hikari and make his way here?!” Michael said, his voice breaking.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMjFmOWU4YzgyNTRmZGI5Yjc0ODMxZGY4MmFiMmM3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And as soon as he got inside, the AI assistant could have helped him figure out what to do. Tsk,” Gabriel added.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZTZkY2M3ZjIyYzRlYzNhMDNmMDZkY2Q0YWYyM2Nl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“H-Hmph. No matter! Bringing this stupid kid here won’t stop the installation of the new system. As soon as the angels are gone, there will be no evidence they ever existed. No one can go after us,” Michael said.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyODRmZTY2NTRmYTQ3Y2Y5MmVhNzNlMTU1ZDk3YmVh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite being locked inside Hikari’s barrier, the situation was still overwhelmingly in their favor. Hikari couldn’t hold them back forever. Even if she could trounce them, the Illumination couldn’t be stopped. Thus, it was only natural that the archangels were still feeling cocky.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYmU2YzdmYmNiOTQyMmViNTlmYTc5NDZlNzQ4Yzcw"><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the dire situation never registered with me.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YWU1OTVjZmYyYTQ0M2Y4YWY5MDY3NGZiZGYyMjFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">That was because, ever since Raphael had opened his mouth, I noticed that a certain someone was already awake, just waiting for the right time to make a comeback.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiY2I0ZGI1NWNlMTQ3ZjFiZDgwMGJkMmE1MWFjMjU5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, who are you calling stupid?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzM2QzYjM0YWJmZTQ0ZjBiNzE1OTA3YjA2YTRiMjE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">A childish, high-pitched voice cut through the tension in the air like a hot knife through butter.</span></p><span class="cmJkZmQ3YmJmMmUyZjRmNmVhYmE0M2E3ZTYzNzEzNGJj"><br/>The narrative has been taken without permission. Report any sightings.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNjMjBhNWI1OTg4YTRjNWVhNGE5OWRhMTNhODA4Nzdh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’ve finally woken up, hm?” The man holding her increased the grip on her frail body. “Just in time to see the disappearance of your little virtual friends.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNjBmYjA3YjgxNDQyZWVhZjNiZWYyN2Q3MjA1NDU0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, actually, I don’t think I will,” she replied with such a jovial tone that it caught everyone by surprise.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZjRiZjcyMWQxNzQ5YTdhNWMxODJjNjhlNTU1ZWI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmph. What can you do in this situation, hm? You’re just a powerless—”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNjUzM2QwMWQxNDRiMTQ5NjFkMjVjNjM3MDJmNDNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Right then and there, the unforeseen happened. With sheer strength, Ayumi broke free of the Archangel’s grip, flinging his arms out. It was an unreal sight; with her small body, there was no way she could have wrestled out of a grown man’s grip so easily.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNjc3YTMyMTk1ZDQ4Mzg4NDFmMjBhMTBiMWYxYjY2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Michael groaned, and kneeled in agony. Before the other two could grab her, she ran over to us with a light gait. Unlike what happened before, when the archangels were stopped in their tracks by Hikari’s barrier, she walked right through it. She didn’t hesitate or get stopped at all. The girl</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">broke through</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">it effortlessly, the accompanying shrill of glass breaking piercing the cold air.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMTY0YjgwY2FhNTQ4MDdhMzcxOWFlMDgyOTRlMjJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Fair to say, Hikari was dumbfounded.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OWZlNzBkZWRlMjRlOTdiNjkyOGU3ZTU1N2RkNzEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">For a split second, Ayumi locked her eyes with mine—and smiled.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MmUwNWM5OTM2NDQ4MWE4Mjc1ODE3ZDRmZTViMDAw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her emerald green eyes shone with such intensity, such fervor, that it brought me to tears.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMmEyZjMyNDVkMjRmNDNiMDgwZGFiNjNmZWI3Y2Fk"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no mistaking it.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OGE1ZjZjODBkMjQxOTZiNjNjNDk4NTc1ZTVlYmE3"><span style="font-weight: 400">This was her.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZTc4NWU0ZWI1NTQwMjZiZjAwZDdjMDE2N2Q5YzRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ayumi was back.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MTAxZjc3MWFiOTQxMzdhZGUzYmJiZGY4ZTBmY2Rj"><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried my best, but in spite of the situation, my sobbing didn’t stop.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzU2NzA4NTU0MjQxNTU4MzUxMDIyZTg5N2Y0YTQ1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing Ayumi, the real Ayumi, back after an entire week—it seemed like a miracle.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZjNlOTE1ODA0ZTQxMGM4MDZlYmY0YzI4OGIxNTU5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wow, Takkun!? What’s wrong? I’ve never seen you cry like this!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMTQzZTg3NGJmYjQ4YzVhNGMxOGJhNWE0NGY4YjFm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing Ayumi’s eyes fixated on my lame figure was the push I needed to control myself. “It’s nothing… I-I’m just glad to have the real you back.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NmI0ZTQ4NjY4MzRlNzc5YzViMmRkYTE1MzdjNTk1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? Real me…? Oh, right. You had to interact with my proxy this entire week—”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YWYxNTExMmUxYzQzNjdhYjNjMWYyY2U0NjFjZTQ0"><span style="font-weight: 400">However, our reunion was short-lived.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4M2U2NTU5NGMwYTQxNmI4Njg3MTVkZThlY2JkODdm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You… how did you do that?” Gabriel asked, equally bamboozled as everyone else. “You shouldn’t be able to…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMTI0NTVjZGMwOTQzMjdiNjk1OGY1ZmNjODRjMzY2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you think I spent an entire week doing?” she said, turning back to the archangels. “I went and got some help from like-minded people who care when someone is about to commit genocide of a million people,” she responded with disgust permeating her words. “And through a certain connection, I got myself familiar with </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">my own permissions</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. I have been training on how to use them while people found a way to break me in.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZDM5MGZiMDE5NzQ4MGU5NTQxYmE1ZjNkYWFiYjY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">The archangels stared at the girl in front of them. It seemed the reality of the situation had just kicked in. This girl, who they’d thought to be no more than a footnote in their plan, had utterly crushed any hope they had of seeing it to completion.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYzE0ODUzMWQwNTRjODg4NWQxZGE0NTgwY2Y3Y2I2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, there’s much to do, and you little worms are in the way. So how about you have a taste of your own medicine?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNWVhMDkzNTJlMzQxMDg4NGFkMjkzMmVkOGExYTc2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What… are you…” Michael tried to say, but the pain he felt was too strong to form a coherent sentence.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YzY5MWRiYzY2NTQwNzI5NzFkYzk0OWJlZTA2NTlj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m going to banish you. In other words, remove your permissions. Ah, and forcibly log you out too. Some people are already looking for you on the other side.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3N2M5YzA2ODFmZTQxZTA4ODgwNjY1MWE3MWE0NTkx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, wait…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NzQ4MTc1YWE3MDQ3ZGNiZWZkY2ZhNTA4ZTlmMzhj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Too late.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZGI0Y2MzMTRkNDRlMzBiN2MzMzIwYWFkYjE0YWVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ayumi moved faster than I had ever seen her move in my life, with a fury I had never seen on her either.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZWZkYzkzNWQxZDRiZTc4YTk1M2RhYjUzNjY4YzM1"><span style="font-weight: 400">However, someone moved faster than she did.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNWRiNjc4NWFkYjQxNTZhMzU4NTQ2MTBiYTk5ODAz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“...Huh?” The girl said as she stopped in her tracks.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MDM2ZmVhODk4YzRlNTc5MGQzMTFlZTE5NWVmOGJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Someone stood in-between her and the archangels.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZGNiZTAwNmUyZjRmYzM4Y2U5NzU0Y2I0ZWEzNjIz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ayumi… please. Don’t do this.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNzY4MWYxNjBlMDRkMjhiYThkZDU4ZTRkODBlMjNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked at the much taller girl straight at her eyes. “Shiina? But why?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYWVlYjliZjE0NTQ3ZTM5OGEyZGY4ZWZiNTk3ZGQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no point in asking what she was doing. Instead, Ayumi asked “why”. Why was Shiina trying to stop Ayumi from banishing the archangels?</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMjE3ZWE1NjkzMjQ3ZDVhYTMxOTYwNGFmMDM5Mjg0"><span style="font-weight: 400">The answer was obvious; but, of course, Ayumi didn’t know that.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NjhiZjRjYjJiZDRmMTk5NmJhMDgzMTcyYzkyZDg1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t you understand what’s going on? What’s at stake here? Angels—”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OWM4ZmNiYWQ0MzRmY2JiM2NjMDA0OThhZTQwZmMy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand. I understand everything,” the former angel said.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxY2JlMDBjMjMxMTRkZDhhYTg1MTc0NTU5NzJjNzQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">And yet she didn’t budge.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOWI4MzcyYmQ4NzQyZTFhZjg3ZmQyYWNmNjkzMWU0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Something more important than her own existence—heck, the existence of all angels—was at stake for her.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZGJjYTRlODE4MDQxNmNhOTBjMTk2OGMwYjcxZGYx"><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the perpetuation of the “lie” angels had been told all their existence.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Yzk0NjBmNjcwNTQ2M2ZhNjZkM2EzMjc2NWYxZDBj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet, someone who was in the exact same situation as she was wouldn’t let her resistance stand.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYzkyMmYzMzE3YjRjMjNiMTJlNGU0ODI5NjY1NjMy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shiina, do you not get it?” Hikari said from beside me. “The archangels have been deceiving us! God, our religion, our powers—all of it is a lie. They even banished you because you knew too much! And yet you still stand by their side?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZTgwOTI0YWE3YzRlODFhODVmN2VkZWVkMTE3YTdj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina bit her lip. It took a while for her to answer. “It doesn’t matter. Without them, without all of this… What’s the point?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0OWRlYTkwYzgwODQzMzZiYjNhYzEyOGNlZDdkMDJj"><span style="font-weight: 400">She paused, and looked straight into Hikari’s eyes. “Y-you should have never given me back my memories. At least as a human, I would have survived the I-Illumination. I could have kept on living in ignorance and rebuilt my life. B-but now, like this… I have nothing left. No powers, no duty… nothing. I’m worth… nothing. So it’s better to just let it all end as God intended.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NmY4MzU4NmQ1MDQ2NThiOThjMjgyYWFiOWY2YjQ1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina’s words lingered in the stifled air like miasma. It’s not like Ayumi and Hikari couldn’t just shove her aside using their powers. But something about seeing that woman they both barely knew, and yet cared deeply about, not able to let go, made them stay rooted on the spot.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZTVlNDY0OTljNTQ4Zjg5NTlkY2VmNjgwY2NlYmNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">A shrill laughter pierced the air, from none other than the ringleader Shiina was trying to defend. “Eheh. Ahahaha! That’s right! You’re worth nothing! You—all of you—you are all worthless! You’re not even worth the bytes you take up on this computer.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZDI3YTk2Y2I2MDQ5NjI4MDcyMjcwNzk1MmYxN2Uy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Something about what Michael said struck me the wrong way. As if there was a grain of sand stuck in my shoe that I couldn’t get rid of, and he had just reminded me it was there.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZjdmNmI5MDVlNzRmNTY4ODhhYjYxZjJlZmY5NGZj"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Are these the ramblings of a lunatic, or something else?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnNhMGQ4Yzc3MWQ5NjQ4MzVhZGEzMmVjMThlMzNjOWI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s better that you all perish still believing in this delusion of ‘god’ or whatever crap you pray to. I’d suggest you trust in your little virtual friends and let things run their course, Ayumi.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZmYxOTdmMjVlNTQ2MjY5MDA4ZjM2MDI1ZjFiYThk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hikari was the first to act upon what he was saying. She asked the question none of us had dared to so far. Probably the most important question she had ever asked in her entire life.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZmFmN2QwZmI5NDRjNmNhYjIzNGQzYThlZjY3OWY2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ayumi, please tell me. Is what Michael is saying the truth? Are we…”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZmFjMTI3NTA1OTRlMGJiN2I0Nzc5YmZlZDk0MWM1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ayumi, however, did not respond. She just lowered her head, as if saying the words out loud would break some sort of taboo.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MTMzMTkzNzk2ZDQzMTRiZWViMmUxOTAxYTI0NTQz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Guess you haven’t figured it all out yet, little angel, so let me spell it out for you.” Gabriel spewed with venom in her tone.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDQ5ZDM4NDgwOTRjZTM4NmE5MzVkNmNhMDgwMDEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“All of you—the angel and the humans—all of you are just AIs. NPCs. Whatever you want to call yourselves, it doesn’t matter to me. None of you exist outside this simulation.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMWJmZmFlMzgwMTQ1NTI4YjdkYWI0Yzc2ODgyMTgz"><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the moment my entire world came crashing down.</span></p>
