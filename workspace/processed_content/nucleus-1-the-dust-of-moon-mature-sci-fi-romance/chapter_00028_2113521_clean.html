   abari moved through the walkway connecting the bridge to the cargo hold, the hum of engines growing louder. The mission to secure Ume had succeeded, but tension aboard their stolen craft remained high. He'd noticed Celine growing more agitated since leaving Taiwan, her usual composure giving way to short responses and a tight jaw.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As he approached the cargo bay, hushed voices carried through the half-open hatch. He slowed down to listen.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "—simply explaining that your distrust is unwarranted, Madame Celine." Ume's voice was calm. "My behavioral protocols—"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "To put it bluntly, U6-M9," Celine interrupted, her accent thickening. "You're not one of us. We did not rescue you for some vague sense of justice. You're an asset. Do not presume."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari looked through the gap. Celine stood with arms crossed, facing Ume across the bay. Behind them, Jabari's KM-233 Scarab mech stood silent, its powered-down systems casting shadows in the dim light.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I understand your concerns," Ume replied, tilting her head slightly. "But I am no longer bound by ZenFusion's restrictions. Xin altered my programming to—"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "To what?" Celine stepped closer, her voice dropping. "To make you more convincing? More human-like?" She gestured at Ume's traditional clothes. "Everything about you—your appearance, your mannerisms, your voice—it's all designed to manipulate."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Ume's amber eyes flickered slightly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I was not designed to replace human connection, madam," She said. "I was designed to emulate it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Is that supposed to reassure me?" Celine pulled a small device from her pocket and aimed it at Ume. Jabari recognized it as an Omni-scanner used to diagnose all manners of fusion-powered 'properties'. Androids included. "What guides your actions now, U6-M9?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The tension grew. Ume's hands, previously folded in front of her, now hung at her sides, fingers curling slightly. Though her face remained calm, something in her stance had changed—a subtle readiness that reminded Jabari of combat drills at Cape Coast.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "My name," Ume said firmly, "is Ume."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Celine raised her eyebrows slightly. "A name doesn't make you human."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "No," Ume agreed, "but neither does biological birth guarantee humanity." She took a step forward. "I've reviewed human history carefully. Many commit atrocities daily. Betray loved ones, abandon children, wage war over resources. All while possessing the very empathy you claim I lack."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Celine's scanner remained steady. "Clever retort. Did this Xin program that too?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "He programmed me to think for myself." Ume replied as s
  </span>
  <span>
   he gestured to the scanner. "Also, be advised — activating that Omni-scanner near the Scarab's fusion core could trigger its defensive countermeasures."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "How did you know about…" Celine's stance wavered.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari recognized the warning in Ume's words. The KM-233's defense systems would indeed detect the scanner's signature as a threat. He pushed the hatch open and stepped into the cargo bay.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Hey! Everything alright in here?" he asked casually.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Both turned toward him. Celine quickly lowered the scanner, though she still looked guarded.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Lieutenant," she nodded. "Just performing standard security protocols."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Of course, madam." Jabari moved between them. He turned to Ume. "You okay?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Surprise flickered across Ume's face at being asked.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I am functional," she replied, then added more softly, "Thank you for asking."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Celine exhaled sharply. "Lieutenant Adomako, your experience with androids — and the Imperium at large — is limited. This isn't a rescued civilian. It's advanced Imperial technology carrying sensitive data."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "She," Jabari corrected. "And yes, she's carrying data we need. All the more reason to treat her with respect." He gestured to the scanner in Celine's hand. "Is that really necessary, madam?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Standard protocol for unknown tech—"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "We're carrying a Scarab mech along with other experimental weapons," Jabari countered. "If anything's going to trigger alarms in Nusantara, it could be those, not Ume."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A tense silence stretched between them. Finally, Celine pocketed the scanner with a sigh.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Fine. But she stays under supervision at all times." Celine moved toward the hatch. "We'll arrive in approximately forty minutes. I suggest you prepare for customs inspection. Seydou's working on our documentation, but NIPU officials can be... thorough."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Aye, aye, madam." Jabari nodded.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As Celine left, Jabari turned to find Ume watching him.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Thank you," she said simply. "But an intervention wasn't necessary. I could have managed the situation."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari raised an eyebrow. "By threatening to trigger the Scarab's defenses?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A hint of a smile crossed Ume's face. "It was merely a calculated warning. The KM-233's shields have been inactive since we boarded." She tilted her head.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I don't mind Celine finding out it was me who told you all that info." Jabari glanced toward the hatch Celine had exited through. "I just joined up, but it felt right to…do what I did."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Her reaction is common among humans who've experienced relationship trauma involving androids," Ume observed. "Logical distrust, even if emotionally driven."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari studied Ume for a moment. "You really do think for yourself now, don't you?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I'm learning to," Ume replied. Her amber eyes met his, suddenly uncertain. "Does that disturb you?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The question caught Jabari off-guard. "No," he answered honestly. "Actually, it's pretty amazing."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Before Ume could respond, Wilhelm's voice came over the intercom.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Heads up. NIPU patrol vessels approaching our starboard side. Looks like we'll get the welcoming committee earlier than expected. Might want to get your story straight, hey?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The vessel's engines changed pitch as they began descent. Through the small viewport, Jabari could see the glittering spires of Nusantara rising from the ocean, the sun painting them amber and gold.
  </span>

   Dock 88, Amber Wharf District, near Garuda Memorial, Nusantara, Borneo, New Indo-Pacific Union territory
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <img alt="Nucleus: The Dust of Moon" src="https://nucleusseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ch24.png"/>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The setting sun painted the city's towers in shades of amber and gold, reflecting the last rays across the port's waters. Jabari stood at the cargo vessel's stern, watching palm fronds sway against a backdrop of egg-shaped structures housing the New Indo-Pacific Union's government offices.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Documents, please?" a uniformed officer demanded, his badge displaying NIPU Port Authority in holographic script. Two more officers stood with him, their scanners humming. "Vessel registration and crew manifesto."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Wilhelm stepped forward, datapad in hand. "Of course, of course. Everything's in order, hey?" His smile didn't reach his eyes.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The lead officer looked at Ume, who stood quietly beside Jabari. "Android transport permit?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "She's registered personnel, not cargo," Jabari said evenly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Scanning indicates Da-Ji series architecture. 11th-generation, Imperium-made," one of the other officers reported, frowning at his device. "All Da-Ji units require—"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Special documentation, yes." Wilhelm produced a slim case from his emerald jacket. "Though I believe these might help — expedite the process?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari glimpsed pleasure district cards that Wilhelm handed over, each showing a scantily dressed woman.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The first card showed 'Isabella', with mint green hair in red lingerie.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The next was 'Yuki', with pale skin and dark eyes in a kimono similar to Ume's.
  </span>
 </p>
 <span>
  <br/>
  Stolen content warning: this tale belongs on Royal Road. Report any occurrences elsewhere.
  <br/>
 </span>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari looked at the third card labeled 'Cassandra', with brown hair in black lace.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   His jaw tightened. "Those are…uh…"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Premium-grade Leased Lily service vouchers," Ume stated, her voice neutral. "Valid for thirty standard days of companionship services at any registered establishment in the Scollay II district on planet Venus. Current market value: approximately 50,000 Atomic Dollars per voucher. Services include but are not limited to—"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yeah, that's uh — that's enough, Ume," Jabari cut in, noticing how the officers now looked interested instead of suspicious.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The lead officer cleared his throat, putting the vouchers in his pocket. "Well, everything seems to be in order here." He gestured to his colleagues. "Expedited clearance protocols."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Behind them, Celine monitored communications while Seydou ran diagnostics. Better to have experienced eyes watching their backs in unfamiliar territory.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The vessel's hold contained Jabari's Scarab mech, registered as "agricultural equipment" on their manifest. Wilhelm had insisted on keeping it close rather than risking separate transport.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari sighed and turned away, disapproving as their vessel was quickly passed through to a private docking bay.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The dock hummed beneath their feet as they disembarked. Ahead, hanging gardens cascaded down the sides of crystal towers.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "This city's called Nusantara. Back in the Digital Era, 'twas but untamed wilderness, when the Sunken Ruins to the south was known as 'Jakarta the Capital'." Wilhelm said, now alert and focused.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You know this place?" Jabari asked as they walked, with himself on Ume's left and Wilhelm on her right.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Fancied myself a mercenary until Kimaris found me. Best place for odd jobs and one-night stands on this side of Earth." Wilhelm replied with mischief.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari nodded, glancing at Ume's shoulder as they moved toward the city. In the growing darkness, Nusantara's buildings had begun to glow, like stars brought down to Earth.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Two days we lay low here," Wilhelm said quietly. "Give the heat time to die down before we make for Kimaris HQ. Nusantara's perfect - too many ships for anyone to track one specifically."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Hey, Jabari." Seydou's voice came through the earpiece. "What did you say happened to your Scarab again?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari pressed a finger to his ear. "Got into a fight with a local. Something wrong?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Found some interesting logs in the system. Someone accessed it externally — ah, anonymous calls to locally defined functions in shell script. Clever." Seydou sounded excited. "But they forgot to encapsulate the return values. That works for us."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Xin's work, most likely," Ume said softly beside Jabari. "He keeps various scripts pre-loaded on his Quantum Watch."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Anything we should worry about right now, genius?" Wilhelm asked sarcastically as they descended a long stairway, his blue eyes and blonde hair catching the light.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Actually, this gives me ideas for that local AI assistant model I've been wanting to develop for the Scarab," Seydou replied. "I'll stay aboard and work on it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari watched the passing pedestrians, noting how they flowed around his team like a stream around stones, their shorter heights making his group stand out.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "No dinner for you then?" Wilhelm turned to Jabari, grinning. "What about you, Madame Celine? Care for some local cuisine or leisure?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Not hungry." Celine replied after a pause. "Do as you please, but check in at Hotel Majapahit before 23:00."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Mighty gracious of you, madame. Tot later!" Wilhelm dropped his hand from his ear and looked at Jabari. "There's a nice place just east of here. I know the way."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari spotted soldiers in red armor moving through the crowd behind Wilhelm, with battleaxes on their backs. "Imperium troops?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Hmm? Ah," Wilhelm glanced over his shoulder, unconcerned. "Common sight in these parts. NIPU's neutral territory — you'll see Alliance Vanguards too, from time to time."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The city lived up to its reputation. Elevated walkways connected the egg-shaped towers. Ads flickered in multiple languages, casting colored reflections across chrome and glass surfaces.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Malay, Japanese, Hindi, Mandarin — and English." Ume's amber eyes showed yellow lines of energy as she spoke.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Do stay close," Wilhelm advised as they went through a busy night market. The smell of grilled satay and spices mixed with the clean ozone smell of fusion-powered food stalls. "Especially you, Ume. Lots of eyes around here interested in Da-Ji models like yourself."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari noticed how several people did double-takes at Ume. He moved closer to her left side, while Wilhelm stayed on her right, forming a protective position.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A commotion ahead caught his attention. The crowd parted, and Jabari saw a striking woman emerge. Her sleek black uniform with gold accents stood out against the colorful market. Her sharp features showed mixed heritage - Novian angles softened by Primorian grace. Her dark hair was swept up, with loose strands framing her face.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Her uniform's high collar had a cutout at the throat, showing a golden chain. Her olive skin was flawless, with precise makeup, but her commanding presence came more from how she held herself.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Wilhelm's casual walk faltered slightly. "Well, well," he muttered, tension in his voice. "To what do we owe the pleasure?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The woman looked over their group, calculating eyes moving from Wilhelm to Ume before settling on Jabari. Her painted lips curved into what might have been a predatory smile.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Good evening, gentlemen," she addressed them. Behind her, the Imperium troopers formed defensive positions. "I believe we need to have a conversation about your cargo manifest."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "But the Imperium has no jurisdiction here, miss," Wilhelm replied smoothly, though Jabari noticed his right hand had moved closer to a Plasma Handgun on his belt. "This is NIPU territory we're in. Neutral, friendly, with a touch of tropical flair. Who doesn't love that, eh?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "True." The woman showed a holographic badge with Imperium credentials. "But I'm here as a special liaison. Your vessel's registration number matches one reported missing from a Taiwan dock less than forty-eight hours ago." Her gaze fixed on Ume. "Along with certain... valuable assets. My Bloodtroopers won't attack if you'd simply return this — stolen android, to our care."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari felt Ume tense beside him. The market crowd had thinned, those remaining watching with interest. He counted six Bloodtroopers in red armor, forming a loose circle around them.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Must be a mistake in the system," Wilhelm said. "Bureaucracy these days, eh? We have all the proper documentation—"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Including those vouchers you used at the dock?" Her smile sharpened. "Creative. Though I wonder if the port authorities know those particular Leased Lily establishments were... disrupted last month after a Radi-Mon attack on Scollay II."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari's mind raced. They were outnumbered, and in the cramped market space, any fighting would endanger civilians. Plus, their Scarab was still in the vessel's hold, too far to reach.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Ah — I see you're a fellow connoisseur of exquisite Venus culture, milady," Wilhelm gestured at the woman dramatically. "Dare I venture a guess that you're the infamous Marisol?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It seems my reputation precedes me." Marisol's eyes narrowed, caution in her voice. "But pleasantries can wait. Submit U6-M9 to us, and this will end peacefully."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Ume lowered her head, stepping back as Jabari moved forward to shield her from the Bloodtroopers. He noticed the two-handed Thermal Battleaxes on each soldier's back – they'd come prepared for more than just talk.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You know, they say that Radi-Mon attack on Scollay II was the Incubus Horde's doing," Wilhelm maintained his grin, matching Jabari's protective stance. "They tend to take anyone with good looks, irrespective of gender, so perhaps a few handsome men were taken as well."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Quit stalling!" one of the Bloodtroopers barked from behind Marisol. "Give us that android, or we'll carve you to pieces!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You want to try?" Jabari's hand found his Nanosteel Combat Knife on his belt, ready to draw, the light on his green armor's chest glowing orange.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   But a commotion erupted from a nearby food stall. An Imperial woman in an elegant kimono stumbled forward, nearly hitting one of the Bloodtroopers. Her short black hair swayed as she giggled, spilling what looked like rice wine across the trooper's armor.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Oh! A thousand pardons!" she exclaimed with a heavy accent. Her white face and red lips formed a perfect 'O' of surprise as she fell against the Bloodtrooper. Her white and orange garment didn't match her apparent drunkenness. "Wen! You promised to marry me and take me back to China!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What!?" the Bloodtrooper's bald head jerked back in shock. "H-how do you know my name?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Wen, really?" another Bloodtrooper stepped forward, jaw dropping. "You've been married to Lin for five years now!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Liar!" The Imperial woman hit his chest plate, each strike echoing through the market. "You promised!" Her voice rose dramatically.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I have absolutely no idea who you are!" The Bloodtrooper tried to push her away, but her grip stayed surprisingly strong despite her small frame.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari saw something in the woman's white hands – a small recorder shaped like a ping pong ball. Her thumb pressed it, and voices filled the air.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Wen. Was that good for you?" A voice identical to the Imperial woman's purred from the device.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Fucking good, Fuuka. I wished my wife was skilled like you." The Bloodtrooper's unmistakable voice responded.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "And you came so much, too." Fuuka's recorded voice teased.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Your mouth, Fuuka. It's so...soft and warm inside." The trooper's voice grew husky with remembered pleasure. "I'd shoot my load in it a thousand more times!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The surrounding Bloodtroopers backed away in horror, their attention completely diverted from Jabari's team.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Fucking spies!" The Bloodtrooper's armor shook with rage and shame. "I should have never visited that whorehouse in Susukino!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What is the meaning of this?" Marisol's composure cracked as she turned toward the disruption.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Fuuka, still acting drunk, began singing what sounded like an old Imperial love song, drawing even more onlookers. The crowd threatened to break the Bloodtroopers' formation.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Shame on you, Wen." A Bloodtrooper shook his helmeted head in disgust.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The punishment for infidelity. By the Dragon," another backed away. "Forget promotion. Prefect Dinu could send you to the blocks!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Sir? Please, my friend needs assistance!" A voice called from behind them. Jabari turned to see a tall Djinno man in traditional clothes, his emerald and gold outfit marking him as a wealthy trader. Gold necklaces caught the light as he gestured urgently. "She's making a mess of my establishment!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Ah yes, then we should go — help!" Wilhelm said loudly, already moving away from the Bloodtroopers surrounding Fuuka and Marisol. "Wouldn't want to disrupt the fine encounter over there, eh?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari could see Marisol's jaw tightening as NIPU citizens gathered around.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Come on," he said softly to Ume, one hand on his knife sheath while his other arm shielded her back as they jogged after the Djinno man.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Call me Amir," the man spoke as he led the way. His strong features were marked by a black bindi on his forehead, and his jawline showed noble heritage. Intense eyes gleamed beneath neatly styled wavy hair. "There's a local restaurant away from Imperium influence beneath these streets. Underground, secure and quiet."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Jabari. This here's my friends, Wilhelm and Ume," Jabari jogged along, looking back at the crowd. "What about your companion?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   In the distance, he could still see Fuuka making an even bigger scene – now she had climbed onto a market stall, kimono sleeve raised to her forehead as she sang what sounded like a tragic opera about lost love. Several Bloodtroopers were trying to get her down while others tried to control the laughing crowd.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Then he caught it. Fuuka turned to look in Jabari's direction, winking at him. He felt his heart skip a beat as he smiled back. She seemed like an older version of Ume, but with a special radiance about her.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Fuuka's done this dance many times before. She'll find a way to meet us. She always does." Amir led them toward what looked like an old entrance, with weathered stone walls. Above the heavy wooden door, a brass lotus symbol gleamed in the evening light.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You people." Ume's amber eyes fixed on the lotus symbol, her voice rising. "Sand L—"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Shh. Don't want to scare the people above ground now." Amir gently pressed a finger to Ume's lips. "I'll answer any question you have over dinner. My treat."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Sounds fair." Wilhelm paused beside Amir, his hand still on his holstered gun. "Lead the way, good sir."
  </span>
 </p>
