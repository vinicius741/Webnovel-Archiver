<p align="left" class="cnM1YmM3MDc3OGRlMDQzN2FiZTU2OGZmMDc5NDIxMmE2">Karlack skidded to a stop on top of a roof. “Alright, it looks like Lunaria has taken care of the other pursuers.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMzNzU0ZTAyMjNlYjRiNDJiNzc2OTNjNjQwNGFjNWY0">Emma and Sora quickly rejoined each other, and Karlack smiled as she watched them hug.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNlYWFlMzYwZjJlYzQ2NzhiZGMxMWZkMGI2OTgzODJm">The maid looked towards Arrow and pointed towards a nearby abandoned building with an open window. “You should take those two and jump in there.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNmOTNmYzMzOWQ5NzRkNDc5MmVlODZiODAwN2ExNDVk">“What about you?” Arrow asked with a tilt of her head.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNjM2U5NzE0NTZhNzQ1ZjdhNTRiMGIzYTBkZmMwNTJj">“The duty is to protect those two. That is why Lady Lunaria had stayed back, and that is why I must remain here. Hurry, now.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNiODgzZTkxYWQ1ODQ3MGVhOWU2NWFlNWMwYWVmNGQw">The horse nodded, grabbing Emma and Sora just as the vampire was about to begin her protests. Arrow’s ran across the rooftop and leapt into the nearby building.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM5ZjJjOTg2MzQ3NjQ4Njc4YjA4YmQ5MzliOGUwZjYy">Karlack heard the splintering of wood, but she knew they would be okay. If Emma’s priority was protecting Sora, then they would make it somewhere safe to hide, or they would flee the city altogether.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNmNzc4YTkwMGUwYjRjZTZiYTk3ZTQxZGE0NWQyODY3">“Either way, this is a bit of a problem,” Karlack said as she looked around. Several large birds flapped their wings, and they quickly descended towards the innocent maiden from a distance.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM3NGY4NDI0OTM2MTQ2NmI5MzM1NTllNDM2MzNmNGZk">The maid dodged out of the way of fierce black claws. The bird’s claws impacted the stone ceiling behind her, turning a block into nothing but pieces of rubble.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMzYmU4MzJkODYzMDRkZDk4NmMyODZiZDkyMGQ1MjNk"><em>Definitely would be bad if that thing grabbed me. </em></p>
<p align="left" class="cnNlNGFlZGM1OWFkNDQ2M2RhZmRlYzliZmYzYmIxOWFl">Karlack’s eyes drifted up towards the riders around her, and she saw long barrels pointed towards her. Some of Emma’s memories came to mind. Memories of a different world where the people were much more advanced. Karlack remembered the image of television screens, and on them, she saw people with guns. Long-barreled rifles that could attack from a distance, yet the ones around her were not the same.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMwYWE1NDQ0MDAzMDQ0NmNhYjM3NjdiMjViYjcwMTc5">They channeled magic power down their smooth bores. A red light formed inside of the barrels.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMwNmE4NTI4YTlkMjQxZmVhYjBlMzNhMmYxMDU4NjQy">Karlack didn’t wait for them to finish. She launched her whip and channeled magic to lengthen it. It traveled through the air and wrapped around the neck of the same bird from earlier. Her whip shrunk in size, flinging her into the air.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM0Y2Q0M2M1YWIyYzRiNjE5MjFlMmMwNWQ0Y2I4NTkz">The gun’s triggers were pulled. Loud cracks echoed in the air. The place where Karlack had stood previously was littered with the firepower of magic bullets. It created a small explosion, and a large piece of the rooftop crumbled and fell. Screams from inside of the building swam in the air. People fled into the street away from the chaos above them.</p><span class="cjE3MjNiMGM3OTgxOTQxOTI5YWZmZmY5MWQyYjkxMzMx"><br/>A case of literary theft: this tale is not rightfully on Amazon; if you see it, report the violation.<br/></span>
<p align="left" class="cnNkOWNkMzk3ZTU5NzQ2NDhiNTVhOWIwMTgwYjFmYmEw">A frown graced Karlack’s face. She changed the target of her whip in midair. She flung it at the person on the bird’s back. He choked out a gasp as it wrapped around his throat.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNlM2JmMzYwZmMwYzRjZGZiODhhYmM5NjljODdjNGFl">“You are messing up my cleaning duties,” the maid said, landing behind the man.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM1MDNhMjk5ZmQ2ZjQ2NGQ4YjUzZDQzZGUwNjAzNDFm">The heat of the other soldier’s rifles pointed towards them. The man wrapped up in a vice grip’s face turned purple. He tried waving his arms to stop the troops, but it was too late. They’d already made their objective known. Kill Karlack by any means necessary.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNmNjRmM2VlYTgxYzQ3ZGNhZGM2OTlkNWQyMWZkNDA1">Karlack smiled, pushing off of the man with her legs. Her whip tightened more, until the man’s head popped off. And several more bullets slammed into the bird and exploded.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM5Mjk3OTcyZWRlYzQzMDliOGEwMTk5MjRlN2UxNGZm"><em>Fireworks. </em>Karlack realized it was a display similar to more memories from Emma’s past. Only this one smelt like burnt chicken.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMxZDJiMmNhYjBlZTRjZTQ5ZjE5NWRlNzc4NWZjMjM4">The maid’s whip wrapped around another bird’s leg. Only this time, the soldiers around her were ready for it.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNiNzk1NjQ0OTk2ODQ2Njk5MDNkZDBkOWY5MjljYTM4">They aimed their rifles in the direct path of Karlack’s body and ignited the magic inside.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNkZTE0NjczNjE5YzQwOGE4MzZlYjkwYWNmYTcxYzQz">Karlack grinned. She channeled magic power through her body, and her form began shifting before their eyes. She went from a maid to a sword in less than a second.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNiODllNDExMmIyZjRjZmE5YTJiYzY2YWYzZmY3NzVm">Bullets whizzed by her smaller form, and they collided with structures all around the city. Karlack’s sharp tip went straight though the heart of the bird above her, and she continued through the soldier’s body. Only after she cleaved him in half did she reform herself into a maid.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMyMGVkMGZjODY1ZjRkYmFiMTM0NWQ3OGQxNzA4NWU5">“Impossible!” A soldier screamed. He pulled hard on the reins of his feathery creature in an attempt to flee.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNhZGJlZDE4YWZmNjQyMDM4NWRkOWEyMzIyZTRjMjc1">“Don’t run!” The commander of their little flock shouted.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMyOTAwNzJlZTZhMDRlNzY5NjM0NzlmZTJmNDg0MDUy">Karlack noticed that this man was much different from the others. For one, his bird was larger like an alpha version of the ones around them. <em>I guess I should cut the head off the serpent.</em></p>
<p align="left" class="cnNhNjdlNjFiNGFjMTRmOGRiNmY0NGQ5MDNiNDcyYzU5"><em> </em>The maid fell towards a bundle of hay, but before she could hit the ground she gave the commander a parting gift. Her whip glowed in a strong blue hue. She cracked it in the air towards the man leading his squad.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNlMjNjOGI1MTRkZjQ4NDlhNTdjMGQ0MGIzNmQwY2Jh">Following the crack an enormous block of ice formed in the air and launched towards the man. Karlack could hear his shouts from above, but she didn’t wait to see if that ended him.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM2YWUyNWEzYTYwMTQwYmFiYWE3Y2NmMjI0YzUyODNm">The moment she landed, she launched her whip towards a nearby window ledge and flung herself into a tight alleyway. She landed awkwardly on the pavement, slipping on the blood clinging to her boots.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM0NGFhZmRlNjZiYjRjYjk4MDM0NDgzZjEwZmU3Njlh">She tried to catch herself with her arm, but she heard the cracking of her elbow. The momentum shot the bone directly through her flesh, and a piece of white marrow stuck out of her skin.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM0YzE0OTdiYjU4NDRhMTVhMDNiZTkzMDY1MDkwZGFj">In the sword’s life she had never felt a pain so intense. She could only glimpse the memories of pain through Emma’s mind, but experiencing it first hand was vastly different.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM3Njc4ZTQzNzhlYjQ3ZjlhYzliNDdkOGNjNGVhNTI3">Tears flooded into her eyes and clouded her vision as she sprung to her feet using her good arm. Her dwindling magic power wasn’t enough to heal her. She tore off a ripped piece of her dress and stuffed it into her mouth. In the shadow of buildings she hid while the calls of birds rang out from above.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNhOGRiZTA0MGEzZDQ3MmI5YzQ5NjYwOTg0M2IxYjlj">Karlack could feel in the distance the pulsating of her mistress’s magic signature. She wasted no more time and started moving as guards went on high alert around the city.</p>
