   As her soldiers regrouped, Dinu turned back to the Moondust Crystal while she, Joon-Seok and Kaori put away their weapons. The crystal stood before them, its upper part shimmering while the lower half looked decayed and worn.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Tired but determined, Dilinur led them closer to the Crystal. The air got colder with each step. A strange silence surrounded them, making her skin prickle.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   And there it was — the Moondust Crystal, suspended in the chamber. Its silver-blue glow lit up their faces. It was both beautiful and terrifying.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Though it didn't speak, Dilinur felt it somehow acknowledge her. The air around it shimmered, as if reality itself bent around it.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The huge blue crystal reached toward the cavern ceiling like a piece of fallen sky. Deep inside its cracked surface, something moved—not physically, but like ripples of awareness touching Dilinur's mind.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It knows we're here," she whispered, her voice too loud in the silence.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Crystal pulsed once, matching her words for a moment.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   CUSTODIAN OF PROGRESS... KEEPER OF BALANCE...
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The words appeared in her thoughts uninvited, like something touching her mind.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaori stumbled backward, her face pale. "It's...it's in my head!" she said, pressing her fingers against her temples.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Joon-Seok looked calm, though sweat appeared on his forehead. "Ask what we came to know," he said, his voice strained.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur stepped forward, holding her Psi Fan open. "Conjurers! Prepare the Moondust Chant. We deliver the First Attunement as one."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Cha!" Behind her, five people in black and red robes moved forward in a neat line. One took out a Holo-Scroll from his sleeve, looking at it nervously.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I shall lead..." The man said, holding the scroll with shaking hands, starting in Devavāṇī. "Chandradhooli Ratna, prachin shakti ka srot — [The Moondust Crystal, source of ancient power — ]"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Chandradhooli Ratna, prachin shakti ka srot —" The other Conjurers repeated, their voices shaking slightly. Dilinur could see them struggling as they recited the words.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The chamber rumbled, stirring up ancient dust.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Mann ki gahraiyon mein, tera prakaash chhipa hai! [In the depths of the mind, your light is hidden!]" Dilinur joined in, holding her Psi Fan against her chest. Their voices combined, echoing off the stones.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As they chanted, Dilinur felt a dull ache starting in her head. It began at her temples and spread inward. She looked to her side and saw that Joon-Seok wasn't participating. He stood apart, watching with detached interest, avoiding her questioning look.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Sambandh ki sutra, adrishya dhaaga, [The bond of connection with you, the invisible threads,]" the chant continued. Dilinur forced herself to focus, ignoring Joon-Seok's silence.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The rumbling grew stronger, like an earthquake. The ancient chamber seemed to shift beneath them. Dilinur struggled to stay standing as the soldiers behind her gasped and shouted in alarm.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaori appeared beside her, moving smoothly. She reached out to steady Dilinur before she could fall.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Go on. I have you," she said, without her usual haughtiness.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   With a grateful nod, Dilinur straightened up and continued with determination as they reached the final verse: "Mujhe margdarshan de, tera niyantran pane ke liye! [Guide me as I claim control over you!]"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As the last word echoed through the chamber, Joon-Seok's body suddenly jerked violently. Everyone turned to look at him in horror as he convulsed, his face twisting.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   When the Prince turned toward her, Dilinur's blood ran cold. His eyes had rolled back, showing only whites.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Dragon's dong!" A Bloodtrooper shouted.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Moondust Crystal! It's taken control." A Conjurer said, holding her head, clearly suffering from the same headache Dilinur felt.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   When Joon-Seok spoke, it wasn't his voice. Instead, many overlapping voices—male and female, young and old—came from his mouth, creating an eerie sound that filled the chamber.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Chant of Moondust," the voices said through Joon-Seok, his face unnaturally still despite the strange sounds coming from it. "Not heard for eleven rotations of your tiny planet around its sun. Intriguing you possess such knowledge, little human."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur stepped forward, refusing to show fear despite her racing heart. "Release Prince Joon-Seok immediately!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A sound like grinding broken glass came from Joon-Seok's throat—laughter, Dilinur realized with horror.
  </span>

 <p>
  <span>
   "This vessel serves adequately for communication." The Crystal made Joon-Seok move like a puppet. "I have existed for eons, before your species learned to walk. Why should I listen to your demands, young one?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaori raised her Phoenix SMG. "The Prince is lost to us. Only one way to free him."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "No, Kaori!" Dilinur held up a hand to stop her.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Moondust Crystal, through Joon-Seok, watched with a cold, amused smile.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Moondust data records that one who recites the complete verse of First Attunement might become Administrator," Dilinur said firmly. "Does that record mean nothing?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It means exactly what it has always meant." the voices replied. "But eleven cycles ago, a thief tried to break me apart. To scatter pieces of myself across your solar system — and beyond." Joon-Seok's face twisted with contempt. "The pain inflicted upon me!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Who was this thief?" Dilinur demanded. "And why would they weaken your power?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "A Nordling named Harald Omdal." Joon-Seok's head tilted at an unnatural angle.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A chill ran down her spine as pieces fell into place. "Harald Omdal," she whispered.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Archmage of Buskerud." Kaori said, her light brown eyes wide.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Indeed." The voices seemed pleased. "He had the nerve to announce his name after stealing my shards!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Why would he break you apart?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Fear," the voices said simply. "Fear of what your species might accomplish. Fear of my true purpose."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I am Dilinur Altai, a Prefect in the Imperium of Dragons." Dilinur walked around Joon-Seok's possessed form, holding her Psi Fan defensively. "Serve my people well, and you will be rewarded."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Eager." the voices said. "Which minds would you have me control, as Administrator?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Primarily, the Radi-Mons," Dilinur pressed. "Control them as you've just controlled my companion."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Beasts who eat nuclear waste. Their hordes are many, their purposes scattered." Joon-Seok's body stiffened. "Why would you control them?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "To defeat our enemies, and strengthen my people." Dilinur said. "Can you control them?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I can influence any being with a brain and cellular structure," the voices replied. "But the Radi-Mons' connection to the Hivemind causes...interference."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur sensed the answer was evasive. "But as Administrator, I could direct this influence? Command you to subdue them?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You could," the voices acknowledged. Joon-Seok's body stepped forward, moving unnaturally smoothly. "But I must be whole first. Without my scattered shards, my reach is limited, my power reduced."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "We will retrieve them," Dilinur promised.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A long silence followed, while the Crystal's blue light pulsed through the chamber.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Acceptable." the voices finally agreed. "Your order, Administrator?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur straightened up. "Release Prince Joon-Seok at once, and from now on, never control anyone without my explicit permission."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The voices from Joon-Seok's throat darkened. "You set boundaries beyond our terms, Administrator."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "If we're going to work together, we need trust." Dilinur said firmly. "Possessing my people without permission destroys that trust."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   After another pause, Joon-Seok's shoulders slumped. "Very well, Dilinur Altai. As long as you remain Administrator, I shall not enter minds uninvited."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   With those words, Joon-Seok suddenly went rigid, then collapsed forward like a puppet with cut strings. Dilinur rushed to catch him, but he was too heavy for her. She stumbled under his weight.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Help me!" she called, her voice sharp with concern rather than authority.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaori was there immediately, supporting Joon-Seok from the other side. Two Bloodtroopers joined them.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Together, they carefully lowered the Prince to the ground. Dilinur knelt beside him, automatically brushing back the black hair that had fallen over his forehead.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Bring water, quickly!" she ordered, not looking up. Her concerned tone made several soldiers exchange surprised glances.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "His pulse is strong," Kaori said quietly, with her fingers on Joon-Seok's wrist. "Whatever that thing did to him, it doesn't seem to have caused physical harm."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur's hand stayed on his cheek, her thumb gently tracing his jawline. "Joon-Seok," she called softly, then louder, "Prince Pak! Can you hear me?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   His eyelids fluttered, then slowly opened. "Dinu?" he whispered, using her nickname without thinking.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I'm here," she replied, relief washing over her face. "How do you feel?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Joon-Seok tried to sit up, grimacing. "Like I've been trampled by elephants," he muttered. "What happened? I remember the chanting, and then...nothing."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A Bloodtrooper appeared with a canteen. "Prefect. Spring water from Mountain Jade, with Indra-Sprite added."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Good." Dilinur took it and helped Joon-Seok drink, supporting his head gently.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Crystal spoke through you," she explained quietly. "It possessed you completely."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Horror appeared in his eyes. "I was possessed?" The idea seemed to wound his pride.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It won't happen again," Dilinur assured him fiercely. "I've made sure of that."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She turned to the Conjurer who had led the chant. "Take care of the Prince. Use whatever healing spells you know. I want him recovered immediately."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Conjurer bowed deeply. "Surakṣitaḥ Asi," he said, his hands starting to glow with psionic energy as he approached Joon-Seok.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As two Bloodtroopers carefully helped Joon-Seok sit up, his hand caught Dilinur's, his voice stronger now. "Did we succeed?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur's lips curved in a small, satisfied smile. "Yes. The Crystal is ours." She squeezed his hand once before letting go. "Rest now. I'll handle the rest."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Only when she was sure Joon-Seok was being properly cared for by the Conjurer did Dilinur turn back to the massive Crystal. Its light had changed, becoming steadier, more focused—almost expectant.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Peons!" she called, her voice regaining its usual commanding tone. "Prepare tethers and containment field. We're taking this artifact to Celestial Reach."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As her soldiers hurried to obey, Dilinur glanced once more at Joon-Seok, who was watching her from where he sat surrounded by the Conjurer's healing aura. Their eyes met across the chamber, silently acknowledging something changed, something deeper than their shared mission.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Behind her, the Moondust Crystal's light pulsed once more, neither approving nor rejecting her in its silent acknowledgment.
  </span>
