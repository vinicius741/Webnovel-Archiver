   Hey Nucleus readers!
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   So, this was indicated on the blurb when you began reading, but as we just went past the end of Phase 1 (daily releases), I wanted to comfirm some updates on our publishing schedule moving forward. I've been looking at what makes for sustainable, long-term success on Royal Road, so I'm making some adjustments to ensure
   <em>
    Nucleus
   </em>
   can continue growing while maintaining quality.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Here's the plan:
  </span>
 </p>
 <h2>
  <span>
   Phase 2 (Chapters 44-60)
  </span>
 </h2>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <span>
    <strong>
     Three chapters per week
    </strong>
    :
    <span>
     Tuesday
    </span>
    ,
    <span>
     Friday
    </span>
    , and
    <span>
     Sunday
    </span>
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span>
    Same release times: 11am ET / 8am PT / 5pm CEST
   </span>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h2>
  <span>
   Phase 3 (Chapter 61 onwards)
  </span>
 </h2>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <span>
    <strong>
     Two chapters per week
    </strong>
    :
    <span>
     Tuesday
    </span>
    and
    <span>
     Friday
    </span>
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span>
    Same release times as before
   </span>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <span>
   This means Season 1 should be concluding sometime in 2026, leaving enough time for me to properly draft Season 2 (planned Feb 7, 2027).

 <h2>
  <span>
   Act Breaks
  </span>
 </h2>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <span>
    <strong>
     One-week break
    </strong>
    between major Acts (for instance, there will be one such break when Act 2 ends on Ch60)
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span>
    These natural pauses will give everyone (including me!) a chance to breathe and process the story developments
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span>
    I'll always announce specific return dates so you know exactly when new chapters are coming
   </span>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h2>
  <span>
   Interludes
  </span>
 </h2>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <span>
    Will appear as surprise bonus content outside the regular schedule
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span>
    Think of these as unexpected treats between regular chapters!
   </span>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <span>
   This gradual transition from daily chapters to a more measured pace will help us all adjust while keeping the story momentum going. It also ensures I can maintain the quality and depth you've come to expect from
   <em>
    Nucleus
   </em>
   without burning out.
  </span>

  <span>
   I'm grateful for your support during Phase 1's daily release marathon. The comments and reviews have really helped!
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   This new schedule strikes a balance between regular updates and sustainable writing that will carry us through all 150 chapters of Season 1.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As always, I love discussing the characters and world with you all, so keep those comments and theories coming.
  </span>

 <p>
  <span>
   See you in the next chapter,
