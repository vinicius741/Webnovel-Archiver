   “I… I think I need to start from the beginning,” Terrance explained quietly. Everyone had gathered in Maeryn’s hotel room, originally to await her return, but her debrief hadn’t taken long. So now, they were listening to Terrance as he finally began to open up about his past.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The rogue took a deep, fortifying breath as he sat at the head of Maeryn’s bed, leaning back against the wall. “My full name… is Terrance Nightshade. I am the last of the Nightshades. We… they…” He shook his head, gathering his thoughts. “We were a noble family, as you might have guessed. That’s why I have so much knowledge about noble customs… and why I hate nobles so much. My family was betrayed.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Nobody said a word. Maeryn barely dared to breathe, feeling that the wrong movement might just make her friend close himself off again, this time for good.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   After a few moments, Terrance swallowed and continued, a little haltingly. “My family specialized in growing certain difficult-to-produce alchemical and medicinal herbs. It was how we made our living. In public, anyway. The truth is… a bit harder to swallow.” Terrance sighed. “In truth, we were retainers to the royal family. Our duty was to keep a finger on the pulse of the dark side of the law, the parts of society that close themselves off from the light of day. Black markets, cults, rebellions, assassination plots… things like that.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance looked down at his lap, hands tightening briefly on his knees. “It was my family’s job for generations. Every generation, a new spymaster would be born, and they would learn the ropes while young, and see the world with fresh eyes. Society changes, after all. But when the new generation was old enough, they would inherit the connections. They would take on the mantle, and become the next spymaster. The next Nightingale.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance laughed bitterly. “Whoever came up with that title had a real sick sense of humor. A nightingale is a kind of songbird, if you don’t know. Maybe my family was the origin of the phrase ‘a little birdie told me’ when it comes to not revealing your sources. I don’t know, but it wouldn’t surprise me.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The rogue fell silent for a long moment, closing his eyes as he struggled to regain control of his emotions.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “You… you said your family was betrayed,” Ernesto whispered, prompting him.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance nodded solemnly at the necromancer. “I was eight. Part of my training, the training to be the next Nightingale, involved going to the various flying cities and learning how to navigate in the dark, and establishing a few quiet places to call my own. While making friends my age, too. Making connections and preparing for the future, you know?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   He nodded to himself, looking up at the ceiling. “It’s apparently traditional to send Nightshade heirs more or less on their own, with a retainer to make sure they don’t get into too much trouble. I remember being so excited, so nervous about being out on my own for the first time. For a whole week! I still remember the proud smiles my parents had when I boarded that airship to Cloudreach.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance slumped. “That was the last time I ever saw them alive.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   There was a tiny sniffle, but the sound was enough to get Maeryn’s attention as Frankie made an aborted movement towards Terrance. Looking closer, she realized that Frankie’s eyes shone with unshed tears.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Oh. Right, Frankie’s father was dead, too. She was no doubt sympathizing terribly right at that moment.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance let out a long breath. “I’m getting ahead of myself. I spent my week at Cloudreach. I thought I did rather well for myself. Made a few friends, had a lot of fun exploring in the dark… I even managed to find a couple of places I could turn into a secret hideout. My retainer and I were on the road back to the airfield to fly back to Zephyr so early in the morning that it was still dark out when it happened. One moment, I was happily babbling about… I don’t even remember anymore. But the next, my retainer, James, suddenly grabbed me and threw me into an alley. He… he told me to run.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance’s eyes squeezed shut. “When I looked back, there… there was a sword sticking out of his gut. His killer had stabbed him from behind. It… it came out of nowhere. No warning at all. No sound, no odd shadows, nothing I can remember. I still don’t know whether that first blow was meant for me, or for him. Either way, James saved my life. I ran… but not too far. It was dark, and I knew how to hide. It’s the first thing people in my family learn.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn held her breath, knowing somehow that what came next would be incredibly important.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I listened as the killer questioned James on where I would have gone. It was a woman, I know that much, but her voice was hard to make out, especially over my frightened breathing. But I heard her say one thing clearly: ‘There must be no more Nightingales.’ She knew, somehow. Someone had to have told her. I don’t know who, or how, but my family was betrayed.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance’s face tightened, his jaw clenched as if he were holding back a surge of anger or grief. “She eventually killed him… poor James. And then she walked away. I spent the next three days in the alleys, stealing what I needed to live, too scared to come out for fear that the woman would be there, that she’d finish the job. But eventually, I realized I needed to get word out to my parents. They’d come get me, I was sure. So I made my way to the Council of Winds. And I talked to Councilor Lorn.”
  </span>

  <br/>
</span>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn’s eyes widened. This. This was the moment. She was about to hear why Terrance’s relationship with Lorn was so strained, she was certain of it. But she could already guess how it went. “Lorn took you in while awaiting word from your parents,” she concluded. “And then you found out that they were dead. You had nowhere to go. Lorn knew you were a Nightshade - he had to, in order to contact your family - but he advised you to abandon your family name, in order to prevent being pursued by the assassin.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance gave a slow, resigned nod, his gaze distant as if reliving those memories. “I didn’t have much choice in the matter,” he agreed quietly. “But without my family name, without the backing of any noble families who might’ve been willing to take me in, I was simply an orphan. Lorn tried for a while, I’ll give him that, but between his duties to the Council of Winds and his need to keep his distance to avoid any accusation of favoritism while playing politics, he was a distant guardian at best. I left his care when I was twelve, and used the talents I’d honed with my family to become the best rogue I possibly could. One day, I would restore my family name. One day, I would be the next Nightingale.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “And then the Mist and mana crisis kept getting worse,” Dan breathed. “And your priorities changed.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Precisely. I spent years trying to get someone, anyone in a position of power to listen to me. If I could get help, go to the other flying cities, if I could take up the connections my family had left behind, I could gather all sorts of information. I might’ve been able to find something, anything worthwhile that would save our world. In desperation, I begged Lorn for help.” Terrance’s fists clenched, his knuckles turning white. “But he refused. He told me that it was pointless, that I would only be getting myself killed. He told me to sit tight, and wait for adults to fix the problem. But the adults weren’t fixing the problem!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance took a shuddering breath. “After that, I tried stowing away on one of the noble’s ships as they left Cloudreach. But Lorn must’ve figured I would do that, because he refused to let anyone leave unless I was in sight. And then all the nobles were gone. Which left me stuck.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “And that’s when we came into your life,” Maeryn whispered softly, her voice almost inaudible.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “And that’s when you came into my life,” Terance confirmed, a small smile playing at his lips. “And you helped me leave Cloudreach. I will forever be grateful, Maeryn. Dan. Frankie. Truly.” His smile faltered. “But… that woman. I can’t be sure, but… I think that woman, the one who captured me today… She knew my name. She knew I was a Nightshade. The only way she could have known that, I think, was if she recognized me. She has to be the same woman who killed James. And if she was, then she’s probably the one who killed my parents.” His expression went distant as a faint snarl curled his face. “I have to know. I have to know!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn inhaled deeply. “Terrance… that woman? Her name, assuming I heard it correctly, was Erina. If you want, I’ll take you with me next time we meet.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “A swarm of Mistwarped dragons couldn’t keep me away,” Terrance promised, his face softening. “Thank you, Maeryn.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   There was a long moment of silence, before Peter hesitantly spoke up. “So, um, is this, like, a typical thing for you all? Tragic backstories, clandestine meetings, conspiracies and betrayal, goals to save the world? I’m new here, so…”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Every single person there turned to stare at him for a few seconds, but a guffaw from Terrance immediately recaptured their attention. The rogue was shaking, absolutely vibrating with mirth, and then he could hold it no longer - he cracked, and began laughing so hard he couldn’t keep himself sitting upright. He fell sideways to the bed, barely able to suck in enough breath to keep laughing.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn tried her best to keep composure, but a muffled snicker from Dan broke her, and she started giggling as well. From there it was no use for anyone, and they all started laughing, unable to even speak.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   It was Dan who got his chuckles under control well enough to reply first. “Well, we
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    are
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   trying to save the world from the Mist. That’s our overarching goal. Ernesto’s got a tragic backstory, but it’s kind of private for now.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I’m sure you’ll find out eventually if you stick around,” Ernesto told Peter kindly.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Peter nodded slowly. “But the rest of you are normal? Well, normal-ish?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Nope!” Frankie denied easily, a grin affixed to her face as she struggled to restrain her mirth. “My tragic backstory is that I decided to join up with fearless leader Maeryn.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Dan nodded sagely. “She lectured me in my own office back home. Worst of all, she was right. Truly traumatizing. Very tragic.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Oi!” Maeryn objected, her face flushed at the unexpected attack, and both of her best friends collapsed into another fit of hilarity as she pointed a shaking finger at the two of them. “You two are horrible! Don’t make me break your door again, Dan!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Not the door!” the alchemist protested weakly between chuckles, raising his hands as if to fend her off. He quickly moved behind a flabbergasted Peter, who was looking at them as if they’d suddenly gone insane. “You’ll protect me and my door, won’t you?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Everyone seemed to hold their breath, waiting for the engineer’s response. “I, um… you’re on your own?” Peter tried.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Betrayed!” Dan dramatically swooned onto Frankie’s bed, raising a hand to his forehead as if mortally wounded, and everyone collapsed into laughter once again. Poor Terrance was so red in the face, his laughter coming out more like wheezes, that Maeryn wondered if he could even breathe.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “What have I gotten myself into?” Peter wondered aloud, even as he chuckled along. “Should’ve known that job offer had a catch.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Too late now!” Frankie told him cheerfully, wrapping an arm around his back. “You’re stuck with us!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “However will I cope?” Peter snarked, then his eyes widened, his mouth making a small O shape in self-surprise as he realized what kind of tone he’d just used. His expression was just comical enough to finish breaking the last of Maeryn’s restraint, and she buried her face into the blanket of her bed, laughing hard enough that her sides hurt.
  </span>
