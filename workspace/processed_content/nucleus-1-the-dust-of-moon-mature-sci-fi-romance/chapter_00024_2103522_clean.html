   </span>
  </span>
  irector Artak Otis straightened his pristine white coat as he surveyed the gleaming oval conference table.
 </p>
 <p>
  The recently repaired chamber still carried the faint scent of new plastics and furniture sealant—a reminder of the Diabolisk attack that had torn through this very building just nine days prior. He settled into the central chair, his back straight despite his seventy-nine years, and arranged his notes with methodical precision.
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Connection secure, Director," Diego Rodriguez announced as his hologram appeared in the chair beside Otis. Diego's virtual seat glowed with a subtle blue light, marking him as present yet not physically there.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What's our Psi Lynxes' situation in Taiwan?" Artak asked. His silver glasses caught the light as he turned to face Diego.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Thomas is already in Songnei Starport. Emmanuel has done his part at the Amber Moon Spire and is heading to the extraction point. Both have stayed off the Imperium's radar." Diego's hologram flickered slightly as he leaned forward. "My StarWhale is still looking for a safe landing zone to pick them up. The Radi-Mon situation has become...complicated."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Artak touched his temple. "The sudden appearance of the Fenris Horde in an Imperial city confirms our suspicions. The Imperium has failed to contain Skarn as the Svalbard Concordat demanded." His voice remained calm despite his words. "And Lorna?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Also heading to the Starport. She's traveling in a civilian vehicle belonging to the ex-ZenFusion engineer who calls himself Xin." Diego's expression softened. "He's the one who delivered the Moondust Crystal data and wants to join our ranks."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "With how many Imperial spies we've found in the Corporate Assembly this past year, trusting an outsider so quickly is risky." Artak studied Diego's projection. "I trust you've checked this person's background?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yes, Director. Extranet searches show he's wanted in Imperial territory for 'Rape and illegal modifications of 11th-gen androids' and 'Inciting subversion of state power'." Diego met Artak's gaze confidently. "His reasons for defection seem genuine."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Ah, but the Imperium should be more creative with those fake crimes, don't they?" Artak shook his head in amusement.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The conversation stopped as the conference room doors opened. Both men turned to see the powerful figures of the Corporate Chamber entering.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   First through the door was Vivian Kim, her silver-streaked hair pulled back in a tight bun. As Executive Director of Quantum Pharmaceuticals, she controlled nearly thirty percent of the Alliance's medical supply chain. She nodded to Artak before taking her seat, her neural interface bracelet glowing as she accessed market data.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Director Otis," she greeted, her tone neutral but her eyes calculating. "I trust the restoration of this tower hasn't been too disruptive to your operations."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "We manage, Ms. Kim," Artak replied diplomatically. "SIMU has always been adaptable."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Behind her came Lawrence Campbell, the thin operations chief of NexLink Communications. Despite his small size, he commanded attention in a blue suit with circuit-like patterns that pulsed with light.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Otis," Campbell said, sliding into his seat confidently. "Your funding request was interesting. Ambitious doesn't begin to cover it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Before Artak could respond, the doors opened again to admit Dante Pompeo IV, his massive frame filling the doorway. Despite being 128 years old, life-extension technology had preserved his imposing physical presence. His pale blue suit strained against his bulk, and his fleshy face wore a constant look of disdain. The silver medallion on his chest — marking him as Overseer of the Special Economic Zones Committee — gleamed under the lights.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Artak!" Dante's voice boomed across the room as he approached, cigar already in his fingers despite indoor smoking rules. "I was just telling Harrison that your unit might be due for some structural optimization." The word 'optimization' sounded like a threat.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Three more delegates entered quickly: Viktor Petrov of Arctic Resources Consolidated, Maya Williams from Pan-American Defense Systems, and Elijah Montgomery, the elderly but sharp-eyed representative of Boston Financial Group. Each greeted Artak before taking their places.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As the Chamber members settled, the room grew quiet. The far doors opened once more, revealing President Harrison Polk flanked by two Vanguard marines in their white armor. At seventy-two, Harrison moved with the confidence of a career politician who had survived five terms in office. His tailored suit shifted colors slightly as he moved. His short hair and clean-shaven face gave him an almost military look, only softened by his practiced smile.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Director Otis," Harrison greeted as he took the head position at the table, his Alabama accent still noticeable after decades in politics. "I've read your reports. Your request for increased funding this year is—unusual." He sat down, his blue eyes sharp. "Let's hear your pitch."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Artak stood up, nodding to Diego's hologram, which stood beside him. A 3D projection appeared above the table—a rotating crystal structure.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Ladies and gentlemen of the Chamber, Mr. President," Artak began, his voice stronger as he took on the role of teacher. "What you see is a digital recreation of the Moondust Crystal—an artifact of immense power created by an ancient civilization that once lived in the Five Realms of our Sol System. Recent intelligence suggests this Crystal is not just an archaeological curiosity, but a tool capable of unprecedented psionic amplification."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The hologram changed to show energy readings beside a human silhouette.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Our analysis indicates that whoever controls this Crystal could potentially influence minds on a planetary scale. Imagine enhanced communication, improved social harmony..." Artak paused, knowing his next words would appeal to the audience, "And unprecedented opportunities for market alignment."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "And have you already secured the artifact, or is this another simulated scenario?" someone asked.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Diego's hologram tensed slightly, but maintained a professional look. "Most of this information is from the Deep side of the Extranet. Rest assured, they have been verified."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "SIMU believes the Crystal is in a Nirboh vault somewhere within Osram's core. With proper funding, we can run an operation to secure this artifact before the Imperium or Directorate reaches it," Artak replied.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "So you don't know its exact location?" another delegate asked.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Not yet, esteemed Delegates. But soon." Diego raised a hand, trying to calm the growing unease in the room. "Our team is about to retrieve crucial data containing that very information —"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Jesus Christ. Again?" someone commented.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Artak straightened, his scholarly manner giving way to conviction. "This is not just about military advantage, but about securing humanity's future against threats we're only beginning to understand."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Several Chamber members exchanged skeptical glances. Diego noticed their reactions and maintained an awkward smile beside his superior, clearly sensing they faced an uphill battle.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "As noble as that goal may sound, Director, we cannot act on vague moral high ground," Harrison interrupted, holding up both hands with a polite smile. "What do you think this is, the United States?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A wave of chuckles spread through the Chamber. The reference to the fallen nation was meant as a jab — the United States having collapsed under its own idealism and financial mismanagement over two centuries ago.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Terra Alliance does not and will not repeat the mistakes of the United States, which fell due to over-spending. Of this there is no doubt," Artak replied, nodding while trying to regain momentum. "Our proposal offers practical benefits to Alliance interests, both strategic and economic."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I don't see why we need you folks anymore, to be honest," Dante interrupted loudly. "Last I checked, simply dumping Helionite onto the Far Side of Osram—" he paused, clearing his throat mockingly at using the Moon's official name, "was enough to reduce Radi-Mon incidents in our borders by sixty percent!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Murmurs of agreement spread around the table, as several delegates nodded.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Delegate Pompeo," Artak began carefully. "While that argument has merit, dumping Helionite instead of processing it properly is irresponsible on the international stage—"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The hell does that matter?" Dante interrupted, waving his hands dismissively. "Your SIMU unit was created back when Radi-Mons were attacking our settlements on Jupiter. Well, that's not a problem anymore, is it?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Delegate, the recent invasion in Chicago — the attack on this very building just last week — should be enough evidence that a specialized unit for fighting Radi-Mons remains essential," Diego countered, his hologram stepping forward slightly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Well, I heard it was ninety percent Agent Weiss's doing, wasn't it? Her and our Vanguard marines." Dante shrugged, his weight making the chair creak as he took another drag from his cigar. "I say we disband the rest of you SIMU folks. Let Weiss and Mendoza serve as senior specialists in the Armed Forces. We could even promote them to Majors and give them their own squads."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The atmosphere grew tense as Artak recognized the dangerous position his unit now faced. The scholarly idealism that had guided his career was clashing with the corporate pragmatism that ruled the Alliance.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   In that moment, he understood. He would need to speak their language if SIMU and their mission to secure the Moondust Crystal were to survive.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Artak took a breath, looking around the room. He needed something that appealed to the true currency of the Terra Alliance.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Perhaps I've been approaching this from the wrong angle," Artak admitted. "Let me speak plainly about what the Moondust Crystal represents in terms you'll find compelling: market dominance and shareholder value."
  </span>
 </p>
 <span>
  <br/>
  Unauthorized tale usage: if you spot this story on Amazon, report the violation.
  <br/>
 </span>
 <p>
  <span>
   He gestured to Diego, who changed the holographic display. The Crystal's image disappeared, replaced by economic projections and market forecasts.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The nation that controls this artifact will have unparalleled influence over consumer behavior," Artak continued. "Imagine being able to subtly guide purchasing decisions across entire populations without the huge costs of traditional marketing."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lawrence Campbell of NexLink Communications leaned forward, clearly interested. "You're suggesting mind control for profit margins?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I'm suggesting enhanced market efficiency," Artak corrected smoothly. "The Crystal's influence is far more nuanced than crude control. It creates...mental alignment. Receptiveness."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dante scoffed loudly. "Pretty words for a pipe dream. You don't even know where this magical rock is! Somewhere in — what was it?—'Osram's core'?" He used air quotes to mock the idea. "How many billions are we supposed to spend on this treasure hunt?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "SIMU doesn't deal in maybes, Delegate Pompeo," Diego interjected, his hologram flickering as he stepped forward. "Agent Weiss and our team in Taiwan are currently retrieving the exact coordinates. Data that the Imperium was keeping under tight security at considerable expense."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The same Imperium that 'contained' Skarn?" Dante shot back. "Forgive me if I don't share your confidence."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   President Harrison raised a hand, his expression that of someone used to managing conflicts. "Let's assume for a moment that this Crystal exists and works as described. What's your timeline, Director Otis? The Alliance doesn't write blank checks."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Three months," Artak replied without hesitation. "With proper funding, we can locate, secure, and begin preliminary testing of the Crystal within that timeframe."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "And if the Imperium or Directorate reaches it first?" Vivian Kim asked sharply.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Artak's expression darkened. "Then we face a future where our competitors can influence not just markets, but minds. The Imperium already controls significant portions of the Inner Sol. With the Crystal, they could expand that influence exponentially."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Directorate would be even worse," Diego added dramatically. "Their stance on android rights and resource sharing goes against our economic model. Imagine them with the power to spread those ideas on a psionic level!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dante laughed dismissively. "Fear-mongering! Next you'll tell us the Zorian Covenant will use it to turn us all into religious zealots."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I don't think we need to wait for the Covenant for that," Artak replied dryly, earning a few chuckles.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Harrison tapped his fingers on the table, thinking. "I'm still not hearing concrete numbers, Director. What exactly are you asking for?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "An increase of one hundred and twenty million Atomic Dollars to our annual budget," Artak stated. "Plus priority access to specialized equipment and personnel from Pan-American Defense Systems and NexLink Communications."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The room erupted in protests, with Dante's voice rising above the others. "Outrageous! That's more than double their current allocation!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Order," Harrison called, his voice cutting through the noise. "Let's maintain decorum."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As the room quieted, Maya Williams of Pan-American Defense Systems spoke up. "Our cooperation would require significant contractual guarantees. R&amp;D contributions of that magnitude need tangible returns."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "And there's the matter of Operative Weiss," Dante pressed. "She's clearly the most valuable among your ranks. Wouldn't our resources be better spent supporting her directly rather than maintaining an entire unit that apparently relies on exceptional people like her and Mendoza?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Artak's eyes narrowed slightly—the first crack in his composed manner. "Agent Weiss is exceptional, yes, but SIMU's strength has always been in its diverse capabilities."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yet you admit she's your star player," Dante continued, smiling like a predator sensing weakness. "If she's so valuable, why not restructure around her? Why maintain an entire unit when we could focus our resources on our proven assets?" He looked around the room. "The Chamber deserves to know exactly what we're paying for."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Diego glanced at Artak with barely hidden concern. They both knew they were approaching dangerous territory.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Agent Weiss is exceptional, certainly," Artak acknowledged carefully. "But SIMU's strength lies in its integrated approach. Our analysts, field agents, and technical specialists work together—a structural advantage that cannot be replicated by isolating individual operatives, no matter how skilled."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That sounds awfully bureaucratic, Director," Dante said, his tone shifting from combative to almost reasonable. "But let me be clear—I'm not questioning the value of your agents." He set his cigar down, leaning forward. "What I'm questioning is whether the Alliance's security is best served by chasing ancient artifacts when the Imperium is annexing colonies on Mars, and the Directorate is expanding their presence in the Realm of Divines. Every single year."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Several Chamber members nodded in agreement.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The true threats are flesh and blood, not myths and legends," Dante continued. "The Imperium has also doubled its fleet at Venus. The Directorate's new Isazi carriers can deploy twice the Ologuns of previous models." He spread his hands. "Meanwhile, we're diverting resources to chase a crystal that might not even exist!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Artak felt the momentum shifting. "The Moondust Crystal is not mutually exclusive with addressing conventional threats, Mister Dante. In fact, it could give us the decisive advantage in confronting them. Our intelligence indicates both the Imperium and Directorate are pursuing the Crystal themselves."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Harrison raised a hand, looking thoughtful. "Director Otis, what guarantees can you offer that this operation will yield tangible results? The Chamber's responsibility is to ensure Alliance resources are allocated efficiently."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "No operation comes with absolute guarantees, Mr. President," Artak responded, standing straighter. "But consider what happened in this very building nine days ago. A single Diabolisk attacked Triumph Tower — one of the most secure structures in Alliance territory — and nearly succeeded in destabilizing our financial hub."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He pointed to the recent repairs still visible in the conference room's corner. "Traditional military responses are inadequate against modern threats — Radi-Mons or Imperium. SIMU was established precisely because conventional approaches proved insufficient."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "And yet," Dante interjected, "you've offered no concrete evidence this Crystal will help us against either the Radi-Mons or our human adversaries. You're asking for blind faith."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Not blind faith," Artak countered. "Calculated risk. The same kind of risk that built the Alliance's dominance from the ashes of the United States. The potential returns far outweigh the investment."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Harrison studied both men before speaking. "I propose we put Director Otis's funding request to a preliminary vote. The Chamber will assess whether to proceed with a more detailed proposal phase."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Mr. President," Dante said, his tone respectful despite his obvious disagreement, "without concrete data on this artifact's capabilities or exact location, I believe we'd be better served focusing on verifiable threats."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I understand, Delegate Pompeo," Harrison replied, his accent becoming slightly stronger. "But I'm not suggesting we approve SIMU's full request, merely that we consider it worthy of further discussion."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Corporate Chamber fell silent, the power dynamics visibly shifting.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "A vote, then," Harrison continued. "Delegates in favor of advancing Director Otis's proposal to the formal consideration phase, indicate your support."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   For a moment, no one moved. Then Campbell of NexLink raised his hand, followed hesitantly by Williams of Pan-American Defense. Kim and Montgomery exchanged glances before they too signaled their support.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dante remained motionless, his expression thoughtful rather than angry.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Four in favor," Harrison nodded. "Those opposed?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dante's hand rose slowly, joined by Viktor Petrov and two others.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Four to four," Harrison announced. "As procedure dictates, this matter advances to formal consideration with additional requirements for transparency and oversight." He turned to Artak. "Director Otis, you'll need to provide comprehensive operational details and financial projections within seventy-two hours."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Thank you, Mr. President," Artak replied, hiding his relief behind professional courtesy.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "My concerns aren't personal, Director," Dante said, his tone surprisingly conciliatory. "But while SIMU chases artifacts, I receive daily reports of Imperium expansionism and Directorate insurgency. Those are enemies we can see."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Then perhaps your perspective will be valuable during the formal consideration phase, Delegate Pompeo," Harrison said as he looked around the room. "This meeting is adjourned."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dante nodded, rising with surprising grace for a man of his size. "I look forward to reviewing the detailed proposal." He gave Artak a pointed look. "I trust it will contain more than theories and promises."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As the Chamber members began to leave, Diego's hologram flickered beside Artak. "I should check on our operatives in Taiwan," he said quietly. "The timing could be crucial now."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Artak nodded slightly. "Keep me updated on Lorna's status. We can't afford any complications."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Diego's projection disappeared, leaving Artak alone to face Harrison, who now stood by the large windows overlooking Chicago.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You're walking a tightrope, Artak," Harrison said once they were alone, his formal tone becoming more personal. "The Chamber tolerates SIMU because you've delivered results. But this Crystal quest..." He shook his head. "You're asking for a lot of faith."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It's not faith, Harry. It's foresight," Artak replied, moving to stand beside the President. "The Crystal is real, and its power is beyond anything we've encountered. If we don't secure it, our competitors will."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Harrison sighed, showing the weariness his public face often hid. "What aren't you telling me about Agent Weiss? There's something more to her involvement in this operation, isn't it?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Artak hesitated, choosing his words carefully. "Lorna Weiss was born Sigrún Fjeld in Bjørgvin."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Harrison's expression sharpened. "A Nordling? How in God's name did she pass the genetic screenings?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "With my help," Artak admitted. "Her abilities are exceptional, Harry. And there's reason to believe her Nordling heritage may create a unique connection with Nirboh artifacts."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You've been harboring a Nordling in a federal agency," Harrison's voice dropped to a whisper. "Do you understand what would happen if this became public? The quarantine laws are absolute."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Precisely why her identity is classified at the highest level," Artak replied. "Her official records list her as a Valoran from Osram's New Savannah."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Harrison paced along the window. "The detention centers in Wyoming are full of Nordlings who haven't shown a single symptom in decades, yet we keep them contained because public fear demands it." He turned back to Artak. "And you've placed one in our most elite unit."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I placed our most qualified candidate in a position where she could best serve humanity," Artak corrected. "The question is whether you'll allow her to continue that service."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Harrison studied him for a long moment. "Make sure your team succeeds in Taiwan. The Chamber's provisional support won't last if you come back empty-handed." He straightened his tie, his presidential demeanor returning. "And this conversation never happened. As far as the Alliance is concerned, Lorna Weiss remains a Valoran from New Savannah."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "As you wish." Artak nodded, with a cryptic smile.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Now I must leave. Victor and I will be celebrating our 17th anniversary tomorrow." Harrison's posture relaxed as he turned around.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Of course, Mr. President. Please give my regards to your husband." Artak added gently.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Just as the President walked toward the door, Harrison paused. "Dante may be narrow-minded about your Crystal theory, but his concerns about the Imperium and Directorate are legitimate. Don't focus so much on one objective that you miss the broader threats."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The door closed behind him, leaving Artak alone in the conference room.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   In that moment, his Quantum Watch chimed softly, indicating an encrypted message. He tapped the interface, revealing Diego's urgent update:
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   'Situation in Taiwan deteriorating. Lorna pursuing Skarn at Songnei Starport. Extraction plans compromised. Standing by for instructions.'
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Artak closed his eyes briefly, feeling the weight of responsibility settle more heavily on his shoulders. The timing couldn't have been worse.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   His fingers moved quickly across the Quantum Watch's holographic interface: '
   <em>
    All personnel to prioritize extraction over engagement. Lorna is too valuable to risk on a confrontation with Skarn at this juncture.
   </em>
   '
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He hesitated before pressing 'SEND', the weight of his decision heavy in his chest.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Take care of it, wherever you are," he whispered to the empty room, knowing Diego couldn't hear him. "The future of SIMU—and perhaps humanity itself—depends on what happens in the next few hours."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He gathered his notes and straightened his white coat, preparing to leave. The real battle, he knew, was just beginning.
  </span>
