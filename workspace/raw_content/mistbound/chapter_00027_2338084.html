<p class="cnNjMzIxOWQ4MTk1MTQzOTI4ZmRjM2U3NDVhNjAxYzUy"><span style="font-weight: 400">They touched down on Airspire shortly in the dead of the night, around two in the morning judging from the clock in the airfield. Dan and Ernesto were still fast asleep even as they landed, and Maeryn had to make the hard choice to wake them up just so they could make their way to the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Dancing Dragonflies </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">inn. They’d grumbled a little, but complied. Thankfully, it was only a ten minute walk, and Gerald - did the man ever sleep? - had ushered everyone off to the two rooms that Maeryn still had reserved. Dan and Ernesto took one room, while Maeryn and Frankie took the other. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTYzNThhZmE5NjRmMDE5ZWU4MmVhNDZiYTVjNDhm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Gerald had even been so kind as to take Maeryn’s captain outfit, promising to give it a thorough cleaning. It would be returned by late morning at the latest. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDY2OTM3ZWNiNjQ1NjFhZmFkNzhkYjdjNjY1MjYx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn slept hard and long, not waking until the sun was high in the sky. Groggily wiping away the sleep sand from her eyes, she rose and noted that Gerald had been as good as his word - her Zephyrian clothes looked and smelled freshly laundered, hanging neatly in the open closet next to the door. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkYTE0MGNhMjYzMjRiYmI5MmQ4NjQ0ZmRkOWIzNTAy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Frankie was long gone, to who knew where. Maeryn wasn’t worried, though; the engineer was fully capable of taking care of herself, and she’d be back around dinner. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyZTAwZTk0NWQ1YTQ4NGM4NWNmMmViOTZmY2QxZDYx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn’s stomach growled, and she chuckled to herself as she got dressed. “Yeah, yeah, I’m working on it,” she grouched lightly at her gut. “Food’s coming, don’t rush me.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhZTQ5NWZkMWU4MzRlNjliMjVlYmI2ODVjZjgxYmEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Five minutes later, she was contentedly wolfing down a breakfast burrito being sold from one of the many street vendors. The taste was a little different from the burritos she could get back in Geova, probably from the different meats involved, but it was close enough to make her feel nostalgic for home. Back in Vert, she used to grab a burrito on her way to the surface for hunter duties if she woke up too late to make her own breakfast, and the mirrored situation here on Airspire felt like Maeryn had somehow brought a piece of home with her. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlZjE5MGVhNTYzMDQ4MzU4M2ZiZTNkODc0ZjQ2Zjk2"><span style="font-weight: 400">With her biological needs taken care of for the moment, Maeryn finally turned her thoughts to what her next steps ought to be. She trusted Dan to get a hold of her if he or Ernesto needed anything, and Frankie was out being Frankie, so nothing sounded particularly pressing. Maeryn even checked their finances, and they were solid for now. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiNTYzMDI2ZGI1MjQ3MWU5YzIwODY3YzIyNjQwYjVk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Might be worth going and picking up another errand at the recruitment center,” she muttered. “Or… actually, it might not be a bad idea to see if I can get some kind of smell-canceling cloth, just in case I have to fight more Undead in the future.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzZGE1Y2IxYTlmZDRlZTI5MDZkYWMzOThlOGZjNjM1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Remembering the fight reminded Maeryn about the unexpected efficiency of her </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Fireball</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> spell against the Undead, and she frowned. “If I could form a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Fireball</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> faster, I might not have even needed to get up close and personal… I’d like to practice it, but forming the spell is super wasteful on the mana, and I don’t like the idea of speeding up Critical Mana Depletion any more than I have to.” She looked in the direction of Zephyr Research Central thoughtfully, then looked at her forearms, where her vambraces were hidden beneath her jacket. “I wonder… could I get someone to teach me the rune sequence for </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Fireball</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">? Having runed equipment would make it a lot more mana efficient… and faster, for that matter.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjY0ZmEwMDczNTQ3ZDBiNTc4YTY4MWIzYTAwZmM4"><span style="font-weight: 400">With a nod, Maeryn decided her course of action, and strode off towards the Zephyr Research Center. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2MjI3MDQ5NzQyYjQzMjY5MWQ4YjUwMDkzNjJmNjg2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Welcome to Zephyr Research Central. How can I help you?” Jake the receptionist greeted her dully as she approached the front desk. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlNTVjMTJkYjZkZDQyMGY4MjJiZTdmZTlmZGRjM2Jm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m looking for learning materials on runes and rune sequences. If there’s something like an encyclopedia of known runes, that’d be helpful too.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3OTlhN2I4NzUxYjRiNjViNmQ4N2FiMjA4NTk0YmEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Jake sighed wearily. “All learning materials for active and passive magic use are currently under heavy restriction by the Council of Winds due to the current mana crisis. All such materials have been removed from public access. Limited access to specific magics and runes is granted to fields of work that have a demonstrable need for them, such as airship engineers and city maintenance crews. I would need to see appropriate authorization to fulfill your request.” His voice approached monotone as he recited what was obviously a tired and rehearsed line, before he sighed again. “Is there anything else I can do for you?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTFiNzUxZjA3MzQ4NzA5N2M5NTU5Yjk1MDcyMWY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn paused, thinking quickly. “Is there a list of what professions have access to what magics?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZTFlOGEwZDNjYTRiZjlhOWYyZGYxYzhkMmI1ZjAx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not a publicly accessible one. The Council of Winds deemed that making that knowledge public would too heavily skew job searching in favor of those that would permit people to use magic.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTNkNjNkMGMzYTRkN2E4NjlmMGI5YjUzOTU3MTY5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, there went that idea. “Could you tell me if it’s legal to make a request at the recruitment center, for a researcher to spare some time to train someone in magic?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMxM2Q1NWE0ZjU1MDRjNmZhMWM4MDkyYzM5MzM5ZDA3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Jake looked increasingly tired with every question posed to him, clearly wishing nothing more than for the conversation to be over. “It’s not illegal, but given the current mana and Mist crises, they would require a heavy incentive. Their time is more expensive than what most people can afford.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZjcyOTNmM2RhNjQxZGJiYzFlNDUwZjRlZGNmMDZk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn grimaced, reluctantly accepting that her day wasn’t going to go as she’d hoped. “Alright. Thanks for your time.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0OWFmZGE0MjY2NTQ3ZTA5ZjZmM2E5YzE0MTE2Y2E2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry we couldn’t help you. Please have a good day.” Jake’s face and voice was almost completely lifeless as he robotically spoke the platitude.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhODFhMTJiODhmZDRkNWFhNjE4MTk3NWU0ZjUwMTRl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn’s curiosity could be denied no further. “... Okay, I have to know. Are you just exhausted, or did I catch you before your afternoon coffee, or what?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlZmMzMzU1MDdjMTRkYTZhNjk1ODlhNjZmMzYxODJk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Jake’s face turned haunted and mournful. “The… the office coffee machine broke down a few days ago,” he finally confessed. “It uses a runic sequence, so it’s frightfully expensive to repair or replace. And I haven’t been able to find any other coffee that compares. I haven’t had my morning coffee in three days. Three long, torturous days…”</span></p><span class="cmJkNTlmYzJmMGFhODQwNTRhM2RkMGViM2M2Njk3ODk2"><br/>If you come across this story on Amazon, be aware that it has been stolen from Royal Road. Please report it.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM3NTNiZDIzOGEzZjRkNGY5MzE1NzRlOWE0ZDJmYTI0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn winced. “Caffeine withdrawal?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Y2I4YjdkYjIwOTQ5YjlhMmUxOWI2NGZiYTFiNTk1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“My headaches have headaches,” Jake confirmed, rubbing his forehead. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwOWIyYTdlMGQ2ZTQ2NGJhOGRkZmY4MjdkNTI3ZjEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m so sorry. I’ll see if I can bring you some decent coffee next time I come over.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmNDg0YjczNDUwYjQxMGRhZTI5ZGMxNmJiODg0ZjU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Jakes nodded. “Do that and you’ll officially be my favorite visitor.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5Y2QxODI5MjQzNDRjM2ViYjgxNmEwZWIzZjc3ZTQ2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn left Zephyr Research Central empty handed, but not completely discouraged. She could probably talk to Dan and get some tutoring that way when he wasn’t preoccupied with Ernesto. She’d not wanted to impose more on her friend, given just how much she was relying on him, but maybe Maeryn could make it up to him somehow.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNGE1Mzk3MmFlOTQwODRhNWZiNGE5Y2M5YWE3MWM5"><span style="font-weight: 400">In the meantime, Maeryn made her way back to the recruitment center and began browsing. As expected, not much had changed in the two days since she’d last looked. Still no backup pilots, still no wing-combat specialists, and few of the transport requests had been taken. Maeryn browsed them nonetheless - it wasn’t as though they were beholden to stay in Airspire anymore. Now that they’d confirmed the link between the Undead and the Mist, and settled on their plan to create holy mana - they even had a necromancer working with them, now - Maeryn didn’t really see a compelling reason to stay. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhYTNkMzk5NjBhYjQyMDdhNzg3YmM2ZmUzZTU2OWRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, besides giving Ernesto a comfortable place to practice his necromancy, Maeryn corrected herself absently as she disregarded yet another request for transporting a large quantity of goods to another flying city she’d never heard of.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYjdhMzRjNGEzZjQ2MWE5MjllZmJkMjA2ZTc5Y2Jj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn shook her head and clicked her tongue in a mixture of disappointment and disgust. There wasn’t anything that really stuck out to her as worth looking into. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiYTU1MDUyOGI1MDRmMzA5YWQ3NjY4MjNhZGVjZGZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aye, I agree,” the unexpected voice of Captain Jenkins muttered from a few feet to her left. Maeryn was startled, but managed to control her reaction well enough to simply look at him out of the corner of her eye. “Nothing worthwhile at all here today, eh?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYTJhYzI5MzE4NDRmYThhZTk1Y2I3ZWExMTZlZThi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing,” Maeryn echoed in agreement, giving a little huff of displeasure. “Any luck finding a First Mate?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5ODk2NzkxOTJiZTRmNjZiNzg1NDgxYWZiMWQxODc5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“None. There’s basically no prospects at all here on Airspire.” Jenkins shook his head ruefully. “Might have to take one of those requests and just eat a loss to try somewhere else.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjMDcyNmVmMTBmMzQwYzJhOWRjZGQxNDAyYmVmMTNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">An idea struck Maeryn then, and she was a little surprised she hadn’t thought of it before. “Have you been to Cloudreach recently? They don’t have many airships at the moment, but they’ve been facing off against Mistwarped Rocs, so they do have a good number of wing-combat specialists. I should’ve thought to hire one while I was there. You might have some luck finding a First Mate too.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMxY2YzNmExMjg4ZjQxMTI5YWIyNWQ2OTVmNTIxMTNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Jenkins stroked his chin thoughtfully. “I haven’t been to Cloudreach in years. It’s a bit out of the way, and with so many people fleeing the place, it didn’t seem worth it. But, if it’s as you say… you’re right, that might be worthwhile.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwZGU3MmY3NjdjODRiMzJhNjEyY2UzY2MzYzEwYjhk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you do end up going, say hi to Skymaster Lyra for me,” Maeryn requested cheerfully. “Tell her I sent you, and she might warm up a bit to you.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwOGY4OGEyMzg0OTQxZDg4NjQwZjU3YjM5OTBlOWFm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Jenkins grinned, letting out a low laugh. “Ha! I’ll remember that, Captain Maeryn! If that works out, I’ll owe you a favor.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTNmMTM0NGVkZTQ3ZjFiNGY2ZTIxNTE5YmEzZmQ2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sounds good to me.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM4NjFhZDY0YzYyMjQ3ZmRiYWMxZDY2MzgyNDM5Mjkx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, if you don’t mind me digging a bit into your personal affairs… How is your researcher doing? Has he finished catching up on the latest?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyYjJlYjZhYWQ0NDRkNzdhZTU0NzA3ZThmMDlkNDI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. He got what we needed, and we’re looking into the next stage of research. He’s got a lead that he wants to follow, but it’ll take some time,” Maeryn explained vaguely. She trusted Jenkins well enough, but she wasn’t sure if she was ready to divulge the necromancy-Mist link just yet. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0MDFkMTUwNjcyZTRjZmE4Mzk1ZjUyYTk4ZWQ1N2Mz"><span style="font-weight: 400">The airship captain perked up in surprise. “You’re serious? Your man has a lead? Praise the stars, we haven’t had a good lead in months! Has he bound you to secrecy or anything like that? Has he reported it to the ZRC yet?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM1MzZiOWFhYThmNjQ1NjI4ZTU0YjI5ZjdiMTA4YmY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn blinked. “Um, yes, I’m very serious.” She bit her lip, thinking as quickly as she could. Could Jenkins be trusted with the secret? She swallowed, then made her decision. Maeryn carefully glanced around. Seeing nobody nearby, she nonetheless lowered her voice so as not to be overheard. “While I’m not bound to secrecy, it does involve a… forbidden research topic that I’m not supposed to speak of. Keep it a secret between us?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjIzNjk0NTQwYzRjYzRiNGYzMTc2ZjIxZjllYjg1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aye. By the winds, I’ll keep your secret,” Jenkins intoned solemnly.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4M2YxZDc1MjlhYjQzODg4ZTY0NGFhNzhiYTY0NGEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn blinked, then nodded. “Okay. My researcher had to get special permission to run the experiment. We’re almost certain that the Mist is linked to necromancy.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwNzIxNjIzN2RlYTRiZDE4MWM2N2RjODM4NjQ1ZTVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Jenkins flinched back. “Necromancy? Are we dealing with the Undead?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhNTFiMjA1Y2NhMTQ1YzY5MGEwNzQ0M2M2OTI3OGEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn grimaced. “Maybe. Probably. Considering the Mist seems to be generated at the moment of a creature’s death while it’s exposed to the Mist, it’s likely. But we won’t know for sure unless we find one. But, if our researcher is correct, then the Mist might be able to be turned back into normal mana by a skilled enough necromancer.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0OWZiNGY2ZTczYTQxNDk5YmY2OGI2YzRlODIzMDc5"><span style="font-weight: 400">The airship captain’s face twisted into an ugly scowl. “And with necromancy forbidden in Zephyria, the odds of us being able to find someone suited to that magic in time to train them up is… agh. Are we really going to have to negotiate with the Geovans to get a necromancer to help us?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNkYzg4NDA4OTgyMjQ0NGQ4Y2U5N2VmNTM0OWZjNjQ2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wouldn’t help,” Maeryn refuted bluntly. “Necromancy’s been forbidden in Geova for generations.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM2MjJlNzc1MjYyMTQwNWViYTA1N2FkYzk4NGE3NjM1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Empty night,” Jenkins swore, apparently accepting Maeryn’s words without question. “That’s just perfect. Well, any lead’s better than none. Let me know what your researcher finds, alright? If we need to start finding a necromancer to save the world, we need to search sooner rather than later.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjOTNhZjNiMTVhNjQ4MTI4OGI5MzQ3MTA1ZGFlMmI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn’s stomach twisted, and her mouth opened before she could think better of it. “About that…” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5NjBlNzliM2Q2NjRmODdiNGExOTM4ZDBjMjVkMmQw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNkOWJiODhkYjUzMTRlYmFiM2IzM2RlNTk2NzA0NDIx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, she’d already told him this much. Might as well tell him everything. He </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">had </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">sworn to keep it a secret. “We’ve already found a rookie necromancer willing to help us out. Under the condition of anonymity. He wants nothing to do with the Undead, but he’s willing to help us in our experiments.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmZjVlZWI1YWRhYzQ3NTY4MjRkYzZmZWJhYjZkNjcz"><span style="font-weight: 400">The airship captain looked at her with a frown. “You work fast,” he observed blandly. “Where’d you find him?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0OWM5MjUzODg0OTQxNzJiZWQ2ZjM5ZGI5YTZkMzY3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We got lucky. That’s all I’ll say about it.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM2YzBlNzk5NDJmZDQzYmM5OGVjYjk2NzRmZmU5Mzcw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Jenkins nodded with a sigh. “Right then. Well, I decided last time we met that you were one of the good ones, and despite my reservations, I stand by that. Like I said, I’ll keep your secret. Try not to get caught.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmYjhlNzcwODEwYTQwYmY5NzkzOGM3OTcyZDc3NmY4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn took a deep breath, and nodded. “That’s the plan.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjg0NWVmNDBiNDQ2Mjc5MjI2NzI5MzZiYmE3NzZk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And let me know if you need anything that might be hard to find in, ah, a legitimate setting,” Jenkins muttered quietly. “Between you and me, smuggling’s a tradition as old as time for airship captains. If we gotta break society’s laws to save society, then might as well go the whole way, eh?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlZDZhNzE0NDNlODRkZDM4MWJlYzA2ZmQ4OWRkNzY3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn smiled wanly at him. She appreciated the gesture, even if she didn’t think she’d ever take him up on it. “I certainly will, Captain Jenkins. We’re in this together.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzMDdhMTRjYzVlZDQ2MzE4ZjYyYWRhOTg5MTZjY2Vm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That we are, lass. That we are.” </span></p>
