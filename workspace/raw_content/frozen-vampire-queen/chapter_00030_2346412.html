<p align="left" class="cnNkODU1NThmMzQwMjRhOGY4NzE1MzMyOTdiMDNiN2Y5">“So you really want to play chess?” Emma asked.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMyNmQyNGI0ZGQxODRkOGJhNDcwNzQ4MTZjMjcxZGNi">There was a chess board made of ice sitting in front of her and Lunaria, and all of the pieces were forged from the same material. Each piece radiated a faint glow, and there were white and blue pieces.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNmNmE0YzY1NjNhYzQ0MDI5ZWVhNjI1ZTkwNjljYzQ4">After a while, the dragon nodded. “Though, it will be strip chess as I already said.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMyMTQzMTZlMWJmZDQ5ZGU4YjIxMjQxODNhOGYyMjAx">Emma sighed. “In that case, I will be the white pieces, and you can be black...blue.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNiOGFjMWJmMmIxZDRiNGY5MThjYWFjNGMxODQxMGUx">The vampire grinned. A deep part of her remembered that she was really good at this game in her old world. At least, she knew that there was hardly anyone that could beat her there. Well, in her city at least.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNkNDIyY2YyMTU4ZDQ2ZmY4Njc4YmY3NjRkN2I3ZGU5">People often believed that chess was a game for intelligent people, but that was not the case. Emma knew the truth of the matter. It was a game all about pattern recognition based on playing hundreds, if not thousands of games. It was rare that someone was so creatively smart to outwit competition. At least, that was what she told herself.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM3NzRhYzQ5ZDJlMjRjNjc4Mzk5ODZlNTcyZDU2YTQ3">Also, she wanted to pull one over the dragon. This whole time, she’d been teased, and there was no way for her to tease or strike back, but in a game of chess…</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMzMjBlYWRkZTFjNjRlZDk5NDcxY2MyNGI0MDZiMWEy">Lunaria grinned. “You seem certain of yourself. The way we can play this is easy. For every five points lost, one of us will remove an article of clothing. If you are checkmated, then all of it comes off. Pawns are worth one point. Bishops and knights are worth three. If you lose five pawns, one article comes off. If you two bishops, you lose an article. Rooks are worth five, and the queen is worth nine points.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNkZDA3MWRhZDdiMjRiMzFiZDU3MWQ5Yjc2M2RlZmM2">“Nine?” Emma asked. “I always thought it was worth ten.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM2MGQ3M2EzMzViMDRhNDY5NWFiZTYyZTJhYTMxY2Uy">“A queen can’t be worth more than two rooks. At least, this is the way I see it. If you want to make it ten points, that will just mean more eye candy for me.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNmOGQ4NzU2N2QxZjQ3NWNhMjU4NTFlZDk4M2MwNDRi">Emma frowned that the dragon wasn’t taking her chess skills seriously. “Alright, prepare yourself!”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNhNDEzNmMxZDJlNTQ3ZjQ5NTYyNmY0MTg2MGFjZTk3">The vampire pushed her pawn forward to start the game. She was surprised that the dragon immediately started with a gambit. Lunaria pushed a pawn forward in a way it was able to be taken immediately.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM1OTRkY2E4NWUxZjRmMWJiZGY2NWMwZmNkNzZiNTY2">Emma captured it with a grin. “That’s one point. Only four more, and…”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMzMWEwNTc2YjhhMzQyNzc5YmI2MDMwYjA2ZWVkN2Fi">Lunaria responded with a sly smile of her own. “So, you want to see my naked body after all. You know, we are engaged now. If you really wanted to see it, you could have just asked.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM1YzdiMmEwODhmMzQ5ZDNhYjljZjJiZTRmZDAwOWE2">Emma felt her face flush as she tried to focus on the board in front of her. She calmed her breathing and waited for the dragon. Rather than taking the pawn back with another piece as she expected, the dragon simply planted another pawn in the center.</p><span class="cmU1ODI2NWJjZWNlOTRjYTI4NDgwYjk4NTZmMTExMmIw"><br/>This novel is published on a different platform.

<p align="left" class="cnM3NmJmNTFkNDQzYzQ0NzBiYzMyZmI3YWY2OWNkNzI5">“Haven’t you ever heard of en passant?” Emma asked, taking the second blue pawn immediately with the same pawn she used before.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM5NDZlYTRlNWI4MDRkZWFiNmEyNmI0YmI1YWM1NDFj">The dragon chuckled. “Of course, I’ve heard of it before. I just wanted to see your cute reaction.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM1ZGYxY2U3MzgyYjRjNTk4NjhmNWUxMTUyNTY0OWM0">As the game continued, Lunaria continued to sacrifice more of her pawns while occasionally taking one of Emma’s. The pieces shifted on the board, and Lunaria lost her first five points.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMwOTBhY2Y1MDlmODQzOTFhNTBmZjRiMGJkZTZhZDdj">The dragon wore a button down shirt for this occasion, and her fingers got to work the moment she lost five points.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM5YWYyMWEyMTUyOTQ0YjJiZDQ0YTVhNWFiYTY4ZDZl">Emma found herself unable to tear her eyes away. One button was undone, exposing more of the space between Lunaria’s twin peaks. It became like a performance.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNjMDc0YjQ3MzEzNjQxMzI4ZjExZTg0NzllYzdiNmFj">Lunaria did it slowly each time, looking up to make sure that Emma’s eyes were fixed on her. She deftly exposed more of herself.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM0NDI3ZWJmYjQyMTRhYjg4ZGFlODA5MTJhZjIxNDA3">Emma found herself unable to peel her eyes away from the dragon’s toned midsection and well-endowed chest. The two breasts were much larger than the vampire’s, and the fabric holding them together seemed to struggle against its treatment.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMzN2EyNTI3NDg2ZTQ3Mzk4OWM5YjFhNmJlMWYxOGEy">The vampire’s mouth flopped open when the shirt was finally flung off. Now, she could see enough to leave her wanting more. The sight of muscular arms and a toned stomach had her mind reeling.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM3YzI2M2U3OTkyZDRjOTBiYTMzOTY3OTBjMTA2ZDk2">Lunaria gave her a knowing smile. “Aren’t you going to continue?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM1NWFmN2U2MjlkODRjYWI5NGI0YjIwMDlhMTI1NTcz">Emma snapped back to reality, and she continued the devilish chess game, but it was quickly becoming a chest game. She found herself repeatedly stealing glances towards Lunaria’s chest.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM5MzAwNzE0OTYyNzRhMGM4ODVkNzhjNmZiYjQ0MTNi">“It looks like you lost five points now, too.” The dragon grinned.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMxYTZhNzAzMTVhMzQxZWViNjhlZmE3NDYxM2MzNDk5">Luckily for Emma, her first article of clothing was simply a coat. Unluckily for her, if she had to strip another piece, it would be her whole dress coming off. The thought of it was both thrilling and anxiety inducing.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM1NmQ5YWRhOWQzZDQwYzg5M2FmY2JhZmRmNzYxM2I0">It was only a couple of minutes later before Emma was cheering again. “Ten points! You have to take off another…”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNjYjk2ZDg3NGM2MTQ2NmZhMDVhNjcyNjI3NTU2MDAx">What she expected was very different from reality. The vampire expected that the dragon would peel off her skirt next, but she simply undid the clasps holding her bra together. The thing seemed to fall to the floor in slow motion, and the dragon’s chest was laid bare.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM5N2I2Mjk3YWEyNTQ3YjFiNWI1MDQyZDQyYWE5ZDJk">The dragon’s chest fell away from their restraints, and the two crests presented themselves. Emma hadn’t expected to see a thin line of scales in between the two mountains, but there was one. Moreover, she could see them coating some of the space between Lunaria’s armpit and side boob.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM2NzkxZmE1YTQ3ZTQ3Zjk4ZDAzYTJlOTUxMmI4MmYw">Emma’s eyes refused to tear away from this strange spectacle. She trailed her eyes over the scales, curious about what they might feel like, and she glimpsed two pink nipples. Emma wondered how firm the woman’s chest would be, and soon, those thoughts clouded her mind.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM3YmJhZjJhZmJlYzQ5ODNiYjJlNzkxMjZkZTViMTJk">“What’s wrong?” The dragon asked. “Aren’t you going to make another move?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMwNmU0NDA2NGY2MzRjMTQ5YmNkOTk1NzMxYjdhMGEw">Emma choked down her saliva and looked back down towards the board. She found that two of her pieces got trapped while she hadn’t even been noticing. The vampire realized in horror that they were both pieces worth serious points. She stared at the dragon’s smile with a grimace.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNlYWY1YTRmMjk2ZTQzOWQ5MWVjNDI0ZDEyN2ZmMzZl">“Uh, is surrendering allowed?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMxYzg4OTU0OGZhMTQ5MTc4MDgxOGQyODE3YjdiNTkz">“No. If you surrender, everything has to come off.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM4NDZkODEwNzY4ZDQxZWU5MjIxNDI1YmE3M2VjYjJk">Emma frowned and made her move.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNiNmEwNTE3YmNhMTQ3MWM5ZjRiMzYzNTQxODI2MDYy">Two moves later, and the vampire was peeling off her dress. The dragon licked her lips as she watched Emma.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMyYTkyMDVjMWY5YjQ1OTc5NDgyZDE4MDJhNGVjYzBm">Thinking that the vampire could somehow one up the dragon and gain control of the situation, she decided to remove her panties instead. She slowly pulled down the blue piece of underwear.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNhZTMyNTE1MWYxOTQ2N2Y5NDU1NzQ0ZTdjNTlhZmE0">However, she hadn’t considered that this situation was even worse. Wetness had already begun to pool around her special place, and she could no longer hide her arousal.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM0MTBlZWYyZjlkODQxZTVhNjczODZlNDVkYmM5YWE2">There was some solace in the fact that the table offered a bit of protection when the vampire sat down again. Only, when she looked back at the board, she was filled with horror. The dragon had a mate in two…</p>
