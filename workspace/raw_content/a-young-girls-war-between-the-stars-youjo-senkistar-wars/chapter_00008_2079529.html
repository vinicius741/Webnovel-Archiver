<p class="cnNiMTdlNDVlNmFmMzQ5MDdiYzY5M2I5NzEyNWY3MWMy" style="margin-bottom: 0">Dathomir was not what I was expecting. Not by a long shot. I had expected some kind of brutal hell world where the inhabitants barely scraped by. Where everything was either poisonous, carnivorous, or both. Instead, what I saw was a fairly standard M-class temperate world—mountainous and covered in jungle, forests, and the occasional desert.</p>

<p class="cnNkNGQ4YWIyY2E4ODQ4MjY4MWJlZmY0ZDMyMDJkNDE5" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Don’t let its beauty deceive you, padawan,” Dooku warned as I began our entry into the atmosphere. “It is quite dangerous, I assure you.”</p>

<p class="cnM0ZmQ0YzMzZjY4YzRkY2ZiM2EyYWEwZTFiOWUzMzk4" style="margin-bottom: 0">“All of the most beautiful things in nature tend to be,” I nodded, concentrating on getting us down in one piece with my own skill, not relying on the Force.</p>

<p class="cnNjZjgwMWJhOTIzNzRlNGJhMzY1ODg1NGE2NWE0Yjk0" style="margin-bottom: 0">Reaching over, I brought up the planetary map with one hand and zoomed in. “The majority of the clans all live within one general location—a stretch of land that follows the track of these rivers—the Frenzied River and Dreaming River. If we start to the west near the Great Canyon, we can head east through the Red Hills, cut south to the Frenzied River, then further south to the Misty Falls, then cut west and head north back to our ship.”</p>

<p class="cnNiYjU1ZTgyYTI4MDRjN2NhMWQxZWU5Y2UwZjM1NzA5" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Traveling downriver is easier than up,” Dooku pointed out, and I hummed.</p>

<p class="cnNjYzlhMmNhZjQ5ZTQ3ZGY5NmRmMGIwZDdiMjI4MzMy" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Reverse it, hike our way up the hills, into the mountains, up to the canyon, then ride the river back down?” When the old man merely smiled, I shrugged and adjusted course. It didn’t particularly matter to me, so long as we got the job done. Yes, master Dooku had given the mission to me to plan and carry out, and had even said he would let me take the lead for much of it, but the truth was that it was so open ended that I had a lot of mission flexibility.</p>

<p class="cnNjOGFhZjM5ZDcxNzRiOTRiY2Y4MWQ3N2I0MmVlZjc2" style="margin-bottom: 0">Spotting a good place to put down in a clearing on a spit of land between a river and a large lake, I eased the ship down and brought us in for a soft landing. Shutting off the ship, I undid my straps and made for my quarters to grab my things. Taking out my communicator, I went ahead and fulfilled my promise to Obi by placing a call. Remembering that it was actually very late on Coruscant, I wasn’t surprised when instead of being greeted by Obi’s image, I was met with an option to record a message.</p>
<p class="cnNiMmVjNWY4ZDY4YTQ0NjI5MjA3OWY1MjU3YWI1MGMx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM3MzRlNmU0OGZjMDQ3ODRiMWQ1NjhkYjNjM2VmMWYw" style="margin-bottom: 0">“We made it here. Local time is about ten hours behind Coruscant, so it might be difficult to talk. I’m setting this thing to not receive calls to keep from disturbing the local wildlife, so just leave a message. I’ll check in again later.”</p>

<p class="cnM5MTA4MGRiYjJkNzRhZTY5ODRmMmMwOTBmZWZmN2Fl" style="margin-bottom: 0">Disconnecting, I pocketed the communicator and made one last check of my bag to make sure I had everything I felt I’d need. Then, I picked up the second, larger bag and slung it into place over the day pack.</p>
<p class="cnNhYTA5OGJiYjIyYTRmMzdhM2RkNDc2OGNiNjEyMzA5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNiZjE4OTdkNmQ5YzQ0MWI5ODFkZDA2MmQ5ZDA0YThi" style="margin-bottom: 0">I found Dooku waiting outside, carrying his own backpack. He reached out and hit the ramp control as I stepped off, sealing the hatch behind us. Sending me an amused look, the old man asked, “Where should we go from here, padawan?”</p>
<p class="cnM3ZTJkZjg0ZjA3MjRkYzU5NDEyN2NhYzE5MWM2YTY5" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNlNjU2MDdiZGEwZTRkNjhiNjZhZTk2OTgzMTM0ZDgz" style="margin-bottom: 0">Looking around, I hummed, considering our options. “According to the records, the nearest clan should be the Singing Mountain clan, to the west,” I pointed towards a series of mountains rising in the distance. “But we’ll need to cross the river to get there. The easiest on foot would be the… Frenzied River clan, to the north.”</p>
<p class="cnM4ZThiOGQyOGIxYjQyZDQ4ZTkzOGUzZGY4MjJiOGEz" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM0MjJjNzQ3ZGYzMzQwYzBiYTcyNmZhMTg1MDFlZjJi" style="margin-bottom: 0">When Dooku merely sent me a patient look, waiting for me to decide and not giving any indication one way or another which he preferred, I turned away and opened myself up to the Force and my empathic sense, listening to everything around me… And immediately winced, looking around as danger radiated from nearly every direction around us.</p>
<p class="cnNhOWRmNWIyNGE5NDRlNWI5NWY3MjE0NGMzNzdkNmQw" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMwMDZiNjE0OTMxNTRiMDZhYzljZTcwZmYwMTQyM2Ux" style="margin-bottom: 0">Dooku chuckled. “I warned you. Dathomir’s beauty hides its danger.” I let out an annoyed breath and the old man only looked more amused. “It’s confusing, isn’t it? Focus, padawan. Separate vague, nebulous <em>potential</em><span style="font-style: normal"> danger from more </span><em>immediate</em><span style="font-style: normal"> dangers.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YjJlMWU2NjZkNzRjM2I5MWRmMDA0NzFlNjYwMGI5" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMzMjc0NTgyOWMzNDRjOTRiZTI2Mzg4NjAwZTFiMzM2" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">I considered his words and nodded. “So, treat this whole planet as a Force sensitivity training ground.”</p>
<p class="cnNlOGIyYzVhMTU1ZDQyMzA4MzZlYmZjNWQ5ZTUwY2M1" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNkZjdkMzA3Y2VjNjRhZmY5ODc5M2Y1MzU4ZmNiOGRk" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">“If it helps you to think of it that way.”</p>

<p class="cnNjYjdmZmVhZTFmMDQ2MjhiYWFhNTExMjIxZGYyZmYz" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">Closing my eyes, I did as he suggested, slowly learning to filter out the less immediate dangers, or the ones that felt further away than a mile unless it was above a certain danger threshold. I didn’t need to know about some poison frog or something that could kill me dead five miles away when there was a…</p>
<p class="cnM2YTZiZjY4OTVlMTRmMzhhZjU4Njk0ZGJkMzVhMzBk" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMzNTY2MmVlYjJiYTRjNTdhNjVkZmUxNDI1MmZmNTVl" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal">I cracked open my eyes and looked down. Only a few yards away, a tiny lizard with mottled skin rested on a rock, sunning itself and watching us. The tail, I noticed, seemed to have a stinger at the end. “What is </span><em>that</em><span style="font-style: normal">?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDgyZWRjMmI2ZDRmYzU4NzM4ZTE4YzRkYzVhM2U0" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM0YWIwOTI3YzRiMjQzYWE5Y2ViNmIxNjNjNGNmNDEx" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">“That, my dear padawan, is a Dathomiri rock dragon. Their poison is quite lethal, capable of killing even a fully grown rancor.”</p>
<p class="cnMwMWJlMWRkODc5NDRmMjdiNGEzZThhNDY5NWNjNmY1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMyODBmZDZkNWJlOTRhM2M5MGFkNjc2N2E5YWU0YTIy" style="margin-bottom: 0">“So leave the lizards alone,” I murmured.</p>
<p class="cnNhNWEwYjI0NjI4NjQ2MjlhZDYwZGU4ZmFjYjQ0M2Qx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNkOTBiMzhkY2RkNjRmOGJiYWM4MWQwZDRmYzJhOTli" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Or,” Dooku spoke up, and I recognized his teaching tone immediately, “convince them to leave you alone. You have not yet learned the mind touch skill. This would be a good opportunity. Alternately, you have talents of your own, do you not? That trait natural to the Zeltrons.”</p>
<p class="cnMxNTc0Mzc2ZDk2OTQyZWJiZGFkYmFlMzhkOWVjZDM2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMzZTFhNzIyNjQwZTRhOGNhMTFmMTIzMGJhMzIwZGYw" style="margin-bottom: 0">Nodding, I moved closer to the rock and crouched down. “Reach out with the Force and the power of your mind. Try to impress upon it your thoughts and desires. Do not take control of it, for that is the way of the dark side. Merely <em>suggest</em><span style="font-style: normal">, even if the suggestion is sternly worded and made forcefully. You must not take away its free will or ability to resist.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMDNiOWQzNWJlYjRjYzY5ZTlhNzVkY2I4OGI1Mjhi" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>

Reaching out towards the creature with my hand, I extended my will through the Force and felt its mind. </span><span style="font-style: normal">It was simple. Small. There was barely any resistance at all. I pushed my will out towards it, urging it to crawl into my hand and not sting me. A moment later, the brown lizard moved, quickly crawling across the rocks and into my palm.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMDA4MzAzN2RkNjQ5MTc5OGFkYThiNmM4ZmI3NzVh" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM0OTBlNTM1ZDQxZTQ0YmNhOGFiNTllNjNlYTliYzQ4" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">“That’s a good start. Keep practicing,” Dooku nodded, a smile coming to his face.</p>
<p class="cnM0YmYyNWNhMDVlZTQwMDI5ZTM4NDhiMzBkOTVmNjJl" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNiZDQ0OTMxNDUyNDQxZTVhMTBlZGIyNTYwNTQyYWRl" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">I released the lizard and stood, brushing off my hand. “Being able to convince one animal to approach and ignore its natural instincts doesn’t help much when there are hundreds of them around,” I mused, and the old man simply waited. Seeing he was letting me figure it out myself again, I turned my attention back to the tools I had to work with.</p>
<p class="cnM4NmJjNjUxOTg3MTQ2MWE4Zjk1YzdhMGRjMmVkYmIz" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>

The problem was, this planet was </span><em>lousy</em><span style="font-style: normal"> with the stuff. To the point that my senses were kind of washed out with it after some distance. It wasn’t quite as concentrated as the two Jedi temples I’d been in, but it was thick enough that I could run a low cost formula or two basically indefinitely if I wanted. Thick enough to mess with perceptions. And then there was the fact that I was still figuring out sorting out the various presences and potential dangers.</span></p>

Simple minds produced simple emotions and those were easy to detect, understand, and filter as needed. </span><span style="font-style: normal">The only complex mind nearby was Dooku, who for once wasn’t shielding his mind from me. The old man radiated kindness, patience, understanding, pride, and a bit of amusement. He was enjoying himself. Moreover, he was proud that his student was catching on so quickly, with just a hint here and there.</span></p>

It was something I had never experienced before. Even in my first life, my parents were the absentee sort who spent much of their time working, and had certain expectations I needed to meet, and when I did it was almost never met with any sort of praise because those things were expected of me and it quickly became understood that </span><em>meeting expectations</em><span style="font-style: normal"> shouldn’t be met with praise—only </span><em>exceeding expectations</em><span style="font-style: normal"> should, or would.</span></p>

<p class="cnM1MWEzZWYzNjJiMDRhMmQ5NWRlNzU0YTFkZDMwMTI3" style="margin-bottom: 0">I didn’t like the way reflecting on it made me feel, so I pushed it aside to deal with never. Instead, I focused on the other minds around me. If I was going to clear the path to keep from stepping on something that could kill me with a pinprick, I couldn’t do it one at a time. The best way to do that then would be to make those animals flee from us.</p>

My first combat encounter as an aerial mage. Being told that I needed to find a way to hold off an entire enemy team of mages by myself so reinforcements could arrive. Effectively being ordered to go die for my country, to buy reinforcements and the artillery below five minutes. </span><span style="font-style: normal">The fear.

Dooku reached out and laid a hand on my shoulder. “It is good to </span><em>know</em><span style="font-style: normal"> fear and not give in to it. Perhaps you should narrow your focus a bit, however. We don’t want to arouse the ire of something that will respond to fear by attacking.”</span></p>

<p class="cnNlY2QyNThlMmY3NjRlODY5NjdmZTRlZjVkYTI2NDY2" style="margin-bottom: 0">Unpredictable weather was apparently fairly common on planets high in the Force, unless environmental factors prevented it—such as on Tattoine, a desert planet under two suns, where the weather was <em>miserable desert heat</em><span style="font-style: normal"> worldwide, broken by the occasional sandstorm. </span><span style="font-style: normal">On Dathomir, that meant freak storms.

The rancor didn’t have time to blink before the plasma blade punched through the soft, squishy eye and out the back—into its brain box.</p>

Shelf after shelf of books and scrolls filled the room, lit by a warm, yellow orange glow from artificial lighting spaced regularly along the ceiling and in the room’s corners.

A silver crown adorned her head, six tall and thin spikes on it curving up and back away from her face. As our escort had said, she looked young—perhaps in her mid-twenties at most.

Master Yoda and a group of other Jedi were sent to rescue those aboard and secure the ship. Unfortunately…”</span></p>

Your council believes the </span><em>Chu’unthor</em><span style="font-style: normal"> and everything on it is theirs,” she gestured at Dooku, who nodded. “We claim salvage rights. The ship and everything on it is ours.”</span></p>

<p class="cnNlZTk5NmJlN2NiYzQ0NmI5OTcyMzUzZWE3MDE3MDA5" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal">Frowning, I thought back to what master Dooku had told me about the planet before we arrived. “And since the population is largely formed of the descendants of prisoners, exiles, and outcasts—and the Witches of Dathomir especially are descended from a former Jedi—the claim holds more weight than most.” </span><span style="font-style: normal">My eyed turned towards the lights and the holo-com table. I thought back to the weapons the hunters all carried. “You’re stripping it for useful parts and using the facilities. Using materials left there to train your people.”</span></p>

She looked to Dooku, who merely smiled in response. “Interesting,” she murmured, before her eyes met mine again. “You’re correct. Any technology we can salvage is a valuable resource, due to our lack of infrastructure and preference for the simpler life here. A few improvements here and there, such as better weapons, lights, climate control, and things to aid us in agriculture are welcome, but we don’t want to move much further beyond where we are now as a society. We’re much more in tune with nature, the elements, and the Force here.”</span></p>

<p class="cnM2NTEzNWZjYjU4NTRmYzVhOGM2MjViOGU0NGQwNjlm" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<span style="font-style: normal">And are you still keeping males as slaves, or has your society evolved past that?” Dooku arched an eyebrow and the clan mother winced. Seeing my confusion, he explained, “The tribes of Dathomir are all dominated by their females—a practice which has carried on since the time of their founder.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNmJmZTVhMjY2MTQ1MDI4MjUxZTM0YTFkODFhZjFh" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNkZTJmMDUwN2VkMTQ5Mjk4MDRjMDcwMjEyYmVhZmE0" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">“Because the environment is harsh here and it requires the Force just to survive,” Augwynne glared back over the table. “And no, my clan no longer enslaves males.”</p>

I can’t change everything everywhere in a single generation.

<p class="cnNjY2RmYmE2YTRjODQyMzY5MGEzYzQ2ODc5YTgzOTA2" style="margin-bottom: 0">Augwynne sighed. Quietly, she asked, “And how would you fix it, without inciting rebellion and instigating a civil war that would wipe out much of our population?” Looking to me, she continued, “I mean that earnestly. Things can’t be allowed to continue as they are, or in a hundred years we’ll be down to less than half a dozen tribes fighting over a handful of shriveled up male slaves, who are all related to every woman of every tribe in some way. Importing new males from elsewhere only pushes the problem off on future generations without resolving the underlying issues.”</p>

<p class="cnMxOWVmMDhmYzFiMjQ0MDA4OTBhNzZmMTVmZDM5NDA3" style="margin-bottom: 0">Dooku sipped at his tea for a few moments as he considered. Finally, he nodded. “Let us see if we can’t work out some kind of solution together. We will be here for a while and this is but one of many things I would like to discuss.”</p>

<p class="cnM1ZjMwYmMzN2JmOTRhMThhNGEyYjZlZDcwNGViZmQ3" style="margin-bottom: 0">A grin pulled at the redhead’s lips and she nodded. “I look forward to it.” Picking up her own cup, she took a sip and cut her eyes back over to me. “Tell me, how old is your padawan, master Dooku?”</p>

<p class="cnMxNmMxNjBjMGUzMjQ0YjY5YjllNmFjZjkwODBiOGQ0" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Seven now, I believe,” he said, looking to me for confirmation as I nodded.</p>

We hold one at age seven, when a girl stops being a child and earns her place as a member of the tribe, becoming a hunter and warrior in her own right. A second is held at age fourteen, and if she passes she is officially considered an adult. The third, at age twenty-one, where she becomes a matron—those with responsibility who oversee the children and the training of the younger generations. The next coming of age ceremony is when she becomes a mother, and the last when she becomes too old to hunt and fight and instead shares her wisdom with the rest of the clan.”</p>
