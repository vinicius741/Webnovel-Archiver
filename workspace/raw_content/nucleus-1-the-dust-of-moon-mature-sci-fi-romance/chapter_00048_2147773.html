<p class="cnM3ZDg3MDVjYmU3MDRkOWU4MjIzOTkyZWQ0NmYzMzBk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><strong>10:44, March 1, 2284</strong></span></p>
<p class="cnNjOTI4MGExMGZmODQ0ZTQ5MmRjYWQyYzZiNTJmNmQy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Booth 71, Café Aurora, 7F, Helios Hall, No. 12, Aurora Plaza, Öresund District, Lund, Sweden, Nordic Commonwealth Territory</span></p>
<p class="cnMxN2EzOGFiOGY4ZTRmNDNhN2EwZTY3OGUxZmI1NzU2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Sigrún sat alone in a corner booth of Café Aurora, fingers tapping nervously against her coffee mug. The café hummed with quiet conversations as she waited for Thorin Høggsson.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZDI2YzhhODI2ODQ0OTliYmNhMTA5Y2ZlZmVjY2Fm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Her platinum blonde hair fell past her shoulders, framing pale skin and blue eyes that kept darting toward the entrance. She'd wrapped a gray scarf around her cream blouse, trying to feel less exposed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYThmMDdlMGIyZjRkMWE4M2YwZDk0YTAwNDdhNTYz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">But before she could deliver what Harald had entrusted to her, she had to deal with the man sitting across from her.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMmNjZTMyN2Y3MjRmMjc5ZDkxNjlmNmYzNDk1MTAw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"So, how much do you need?" Finn Lindberg asked, eyeing her with obvious interest. He wasn't really her classmate—just a dropout with a rich father who gave him enough money to frequent campus Leased Lilies. Normally, Sigrún would never talk to him.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNzIyNzU0M2VhYzQ3MDVhM2NlNTAyNzkxZGZkYjVh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">But today, she needed money to survive this semester before she could leave Earth.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MzE5NDViZWZiNDRhOWM4MjEwNjI5OTBhMDg0ZTg5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Finn leaned forward. "Hey, Ulrich told me your mother was a whore too. That true?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTY1ZWNmMjg2NDQxMDhiNjkyZjg4ZmJjYzY3ZTUw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yeah, people paid her for sex. Got a problem with that?" Sigrún shot back, noticing how they looked similar—same pale skin, blond hair, blue eyes. 'Two Nordic stars destined to intertwine,' as classmates always said. The thought made her stomach turn.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNGFhOTY4YjlhODQ0NzNiZGZmOTc3ODYyNDJhMzM0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I guess her daughter took after her," Finn smirked. "Anyway, how much for the lease?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZDc5MGE5MDhjYTQxMmY4MjZlMjJkYTk2NjQ5ODY2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Just enough to make it through this semester," she replied casually, adjusting her black shoulder bag.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZWExMjU2YmRjOTRjMDJiNDY5NmRmNGFmZTgyM2Ji"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Hmm." Finn pretended to think. "2000 Atomic Dollars per month. Non-negotiable."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZjIwOWU5ZDA2YjQ0NTZiZDYyZTlmYzY0NmNhNmU0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Too low. Cost of living here is 3000. I'm not stupid." Her finger traced the rim of her coffee cup.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OTFiZWNkMjU3ZTQ2NTZhZDMzNWE5MjQxNDBmNGJj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I thought Professor Omdal was giving you money?" Finn narrowed his eyes.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZjM0MzI4ZjVkNDQ1NmZhODQ0NGY4Y2EzZTlkMTQz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"My pa... he hasn't called since I left Oslo," she murmured, touching the pendant at her neck. "He paid for tuition, but everything else, I'm on my own."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1Y2EyMzgzNjhhYTQyYmZiODczMTJhNDljMTk2Njgz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Fair enough." Finn pulled out a holo-contract, covering the title with his hand. "3000 Atomic Dollars per month."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZmU2OGRiMWY2MzQ4YThiOWFhYTA4OGQ0N2YwNmQx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I won't be here forever. I need to save enough to get off Earth when I graduate."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZjdmMTgyMTg4OTQ4NjM4MWMxNjc3NjkxYWU1NmRj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You better know how to moan in Jǫturmál when we hop in bed, then," Finn laughed, passing her a stylus. "4500 ADs monthly until the end. After classes, you come whenever I call, and we do it HOWEVER I like."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YjQ5YWI4YzljMTRiMTc5ZDVhZWE3MGQ0M2Y4MTc2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Deal." Sigrún reached for the stylus, but Finn grabbed her hand.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNmI4Yzc3YWVkMzQ1OGY4ZjJhZmM1N2YyYjViNTQ2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Try to tell anyone, or leave Earth before the lease expires..." Finn warned, "and I have ways to make you suffer."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyN2E1NzYxY2ExZTRkMGI5NTI2Zjc3M2E1NGQzMTA0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I understand..." Sigrún lowered her head before looking up with fake confidence. "...min herre [my master]," she added, biting her lip in feigned seduction.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NmQxNGJmNWJjMjRhOTk5NzZjZTg5ZTJjZjg1MmNl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Now that's a good Lily." Finn grinned, running his fingers through her hair. The touch made her skin crawl.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNWRmYjM1ODFlOTQ0N2RiMzUyZjFmM2IzZDZkZGI2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Ignoring him, Sigrún signed the document and set down the stylus. "I need to meet someone else at 11. Do you mind?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDkyYzI0YmYzYTQ3N2RiYThkZDQ4YjhjMzcyYjk4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The contract glowed on the table: 'Leased Lily - Sigrún Fjeld in service to Finn Lindberg: 03/01/2284 to 03/05/2287'</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjFiMDI4NzhkYTQ1NGFhM2E0NGQ2M2YyYTBlMmVk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Fine by me." Finn collected the contract and stood. "Looking forward to our time together."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZDNmZDE3YTc5ODQxNGRhZjRkZWM4YTE0ZWZkZjRj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Sigrún stared at the wall, grateful the booth hid her from other customers.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzk3MTNhNmU5MjQ3ZmU4MzE1ODBiOGI0ZjQ4ZGU1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">After Finn left, she sighed deeply, her heart pounding with shame and anxiety. She finished her coffee as tears began falling. One escaped, then another, until she was quietly sobbing.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5N2JiM2ZmZWIwYzQ3YzVhZTcyZDJjNGM1NmYyYjcy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A few minutes later, the door chimed. Her next appointment had arrived.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYmU0NDUyN2Q4NTRjMjE4NTA2OTFlOTI3Yzg1ZGVm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The table's communicator beeped. Sigrún pressed the button, and a hologram of a silver-haired man appeared. "It is I, Thorin."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZjYzMDRhMWE0OTQ2NzI4Y2ExMTNmYmY3MTg2MmI1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Please come in," Sigrún said, wiping her tears with a napkin.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOGM4OGFkODE5MjQwOTI5YWExMTkzYzNmMDBmZWVh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The door opened to reveal Thorin Høggsson—an imposing figure with wisdom in his weathered face. His silver-streaked dark hair was swept back, and piercing green eyes scanned the room carefully. He wore traditional robes—brown over white, with a metal belt—that made him look like a sage, though his broad shoulders showed a warrior's strength.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZDhmMDQ3NzE4NjQxOWM4MGM2MjkwZTA0M2FlMzc2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Thorin entered and took Finn's seat. "Are you alright?" he asked in a deep voice.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNTRkMjFjYjY4YjRjY2E4ZGNjMzdjZjNkMGNhZDU0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I'm fine, Thorin. I just..." Sigrún sighed as she reached into her pocket and pulled out a vial of shimmering liquid. She passed it to him. "Pa told me to give this to you."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZjFjZWUxNjZiMjRkNmQ4NTMxNTAyZWVmMGY1MmI0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Thorin examined the vial carefully before looking back at her. "Did Harald tell you about his plan?"</span></p><span class="cjg2Mzc4ZWM1YzhiMDQwZGE4OWVkZWE0NmUxZjAyOGUx"><br/>Stolen from its original source, this story is not meant to be on Amazon; report any sightings.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNjYjkwMmM1NDg1MzQ5YTJiODJkYjkxMjMwMTYyMDJj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"No?" Sigrún couldn't hide her exhaustion after the past two days.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwN2Y5OWZmN2JjNDQxOTk4YmE5MTA2ZjQ3YjQ5NmQw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"So you don't know what's in this vial? Why Harald gave it to you?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NTNiZTZmMTM5ZjRjYzc4N2Q2ZDJmZjgzZDYwYTZm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"'Måne kaller på måne.'" Sigrún recited. "That's what he wanted me to tell you."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNWFiNzFkZjU1ZjRmODJhOTQzMGI2ZDAxNTE5YWMw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Thorin nodded, a tense silence growing between them.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1N2JmN2I3YjRiMzQ2YTc4NTE4ZThiYWNjYWUzNDU0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"What do you know about Europa?" he finally asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNWYwNWY5ZGRkYTRjMWY5MDg2ZDc2OTQzOWVhYmMw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"It's the Nordic Moon. I'm planning to go there after I save enough," Sigrún replied, fixing a strand of hair that had fallen across her face.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYWY5OTZiZWE5NDRjNjI5YjA5NWNhZGRkNmNhMmMw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Is that why you signed with Finn? Trading yourself for money to get off-world?" Thorin's eyes narrowed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OTgxZDZiNGU2ZTRlOTY4MjFhZmRkNDZhZmNiZjVm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Sigrún felt judged. "How did you..."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2N2NjYjcxY2ZkNDQyMDY4YmI1ZDRjYzQ1OTIzZWY5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Saw him leaving. Only reason he comes here after flunking out." Thorin shook his head, looking out the window.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MTI1N2Y2YzY2MTRhZmQ5ZTI2NzY5MGQ5OGIyNzcz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Well, it's my right to decide what to do with my body, isn't it?" Sigrún shot back, her face hardening.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OWM3NzExNDEzNzQzODJiZTI3YjczYmUzZjY3MTBk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"It is," Thorin slumped in his chair. "But if you were my daughter, I'd disown you."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNmViM2MzY2Q4OTQyZTNhNWQwYzJiNzRhNjA1ZDk4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Good thing that's none of your concern." Sigrún gritted her teeth.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZTYxYWYzMTUzYTRiNjI4Mzg0OTdmMDE4NmZiMjdh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Europa isn't just where Nordlings settle. It's where Harald keeps his experiments, on the southern pole." Thorin's eyes fixed on her pendant. "That jewel is dangerous. Give it to me."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNGJiNmZjY2YwNjQxMmI5OWU0YzFiNThlYzIxMmQ1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"What? No." Sigrún clutched her Pendant of Mánagrát protectively.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NjhlM2MwYmM0ZTQxOTc4YzFkOTY3ZGE5NjhjOTM0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Without the Pendant, this vial is useless." Thorin held up the container.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYzllOTljNTczYjRiMTA4MGM4ZjQ3OWNlMDg4MGMw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Tell me what they're for. Both of them," Sigrún demanded.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NGY3ZWIwZTUyMDQ1MzY5NjI5NzBlZWY2ZWUxNmQ0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I will, but first, give me the Pendant. I promise to explain why you shouldn't have it."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMTU1NWZjZTFhMzQwMjViZWE3M2NjMThlYzcxNmNh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Only if you promise me safe passage off Earth. And a ride to Europa."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MTExNzBhMDk0YjQ5ZmM5NGI1OTI2N2UyMTdlMzZk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Thorin scoffed. "I can't. My organization doesn't have the money."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOWZiNGFjNjJiYzRiNTk4Y2U4ZGIzNWM2ZjEwMjFj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Keep the vial, then. The Pendant is mine!" She stood to leave.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZTIyY2ViNDRhNDRmNmJiYTM4ZDZjY2QyN2Q4ODRk">Thorin rose quickly, surprisingly fast for his age. "You don't understand what's at stake. That pendant has power beyond your comprehension."</p>
<p class="cnM5N2FhMzU4MzQyMjQzMWY4OTQ1MTQ0MzhhZjYyMWY3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Sigrún backed toward the door, still holding the pendant. "I don't care. It's the last thing my father gave me."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NjQ2NjEyNTdkMjQ3Mjg4NmUzZjY2YzhiZmQ5NzFk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Because he knew you would guard it with your life," Thorin's eyes seemed to glow. "But did he tell you why? What happens when the wrong hands control it?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NjlkZDViZTUxZTRhOTFiMzk0Yzk1MTgwZjk4Yzc1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A chill ran down Sigrún's spine. "What are you talking about?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMwODdmNTVhZTllZDQ1MjE4OTE2OGMwODc0MmQ5ZWUz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The pendant is a fragment, Sigrún. A piece of something ancient that should have stayed buried." Thorin stepped closer. "Your father has been creating things on Europa that shouldn't exist."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNTFhOGQ1ZGI5MDQyNjY5NzY1ZTM5MjQyNTM0NTE1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You're lying," Sigrún whispered, uncertainty in her voice.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDIyNWQ1YWFjYzRhZTM5YjBjZTc4OWE3M2NmYjJh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Thorin shook his head. "The vial contains genetic material from his creations. The pendant controls them." His hand moved to something like a weapon on his belt. "Europa isn't a sanctuary. It's where he's building his army."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDE1MmM3YWYwYTQxNjFhMGI4MmVlY2RiMTdjM2Qy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"My father wouldn't—"</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZDZkMzJhOWRlNjRlNzNiNGM3M2U3ZTA4OWY0Y2Q1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Your father," Thorin interrupted, "Harald Omdal. The Archmage of Buskerud. A man who believes Nordlings are superior to all others." His eyes fixed on hers. "And you are his crowning achievement."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYjNlZmY0Nzg0ZjQ3NWI5MzljODc0YWYxNWNhNDZh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The pendant suddenly felt ice-cold against her skin. The blue gem began pulsing with her heartbeat.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYzJlNGUwMzMwNjQzZGFhMTA1ZTI2MTZiNTgwZWU2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Thorin's expression softened slightly. "You don't know, do you? What you truly are?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNjc3MTA0ODNkMzQ5ZGJhYmI4MDNmNjY2NTRmOTBk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">His hand shot out for the pendant. Sigrún reacted instinctively, her hands moving in a familiar pattern.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmN2FjNzI4MTcyMTQyZTA4MTU0YzY2MjdkZDI0NWIz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Corpus meum leve ut pluma!" The Ordovox words came automatically. The air shimmered with silver-blue light as her body became lighter.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OTBhMDA2ODQ4ZjQwMTE5MDk5OTE5ZTY2NmE0YzM4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">With a step backward, she floated beyond Thorin's reach.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZTNmNzFhNDk4YzRlMDM5ZmM3MDllZGMwOTg5MGEw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Sigrún, stop!" Thorin commanded. "The pendant is awakening. Can't you feel it?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZjQxZmJhYjBjYjRmNTdiMzRmYmQzMjk0YjUwNjU0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She could. The jewel pulsed more intensely, sending cold waves through her body. But she wouldn't give it up.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NGEyZDIyOTQ3ZjQ2N2RiMzAyZjMzNTZjYzJiZDc5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Scutum Lunaris!" Another spell left her lips, creating a silver barrier between them. Thorin's hand hit it, sending ripples across the energy field.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYWYwOWJkY2Y5NzRjMzZiNjQ5MDI1NDc1YWMzODMx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You cast just like him," Thorin said, with mixed admiration and dread. "The Archmage's daughter indeed."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmY2JiNDc3ZGMxNTQwODRhNzNiMjljOGNlYTE2YTlm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Stay away from me," Sigrún warned, backing toward the exit. "Whatever Pappa's done, whatever you think I am—I don't trust you."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDZjYWFmYTNkNzRlYjhiYjI2ZmFkMmU4MzI1ZWY5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Radi-Mons he's breeding, Sigrún," Thorin called as she reached the door. "They can sense the pendant. Sense your blood. They were made for you."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NDkyMTBmM2VjNDQzOTU4MDYzOTQzYjRkYTg2MWE2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"That's ridiculous. Pappa wouldn't save me from Sven just to have me become like him!" she shot back.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNTA3N2EzNWFlODQzY2M4YTIwYTliZjU3NjY5MGE2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"No. The Fenris Horde is flawed. Harald's creations are different. But wrong in every way. Radi-Mons shouldn't be man's slaves."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZmUyNTE5MDcyYzRjN2Y4YTBmZTJmYWY3NTQyYmUy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dizziness swept over Sigrún. Outside, snow fell more heavily, swirling in strange patterns. For a moment, she thought she saw faces in the flurries—inhuman faces with too many eyes.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOTEzNjUwYjIyZDQ5NWY4NjE4MTU0NDRmZGJlYjg1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You're lying," she whispered, but the pendant grew colder, and she knew something was watching her. Something ancient and hungry had noticed her.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNzgzMDJlYWJlZjQ0YjU4MDlhNDZkZWM0ZTMwNDE3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She yanked the door open and ran. Thorin's voice followed her:</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNDE4ZTM2YWQxNzRhMjA4NmVjMmUwNTBhMmQ1OWZm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"They're coming for you, Sigrún! The children of ice and shadow! They won't stop until they find what's in your blood!"</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OTc4MDQ4ODZlNjQzNTlhYzBhZjgwYzY1Y2RkZTU0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Sigrún ran, her heart pounding. As she burst into Helios Hall, people moved aside—but not quickly enough. She crashed into someone tall.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYzc2NTUwNWYyNjQ1MzZiNTg0N2JmZGFiNzIwNGNm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Careful there," a familiar voice said, hands steadying her.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZDE4MjU3OGJiNTRjZDdiNDQwZDMwZmE5YjY5NmFm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She looked up to see Sven Solheim smiling down at her, his eyes unnaturally blue against his tan skin. The same Sven who would someday become the monstrous Skarn.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMGViYTU0Yjg5NzQ0ZGZhZjVmOTkzOWNiN2M5MTVk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You alright?" he asked, his voice strangely echoing, as if speaking from past and present at once. "You look like you've seen a ghost."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNDYwYjU5NDYzZDQzZWViZTZiNzMwODBlYTJjMmEz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Sven..." Sigrún whispered in disbelief.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNWFhOWQ1YmE0YjQyZmI5OGQyNWU4MDUyN2RkOTJh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Behind him, through the windows, the snow wasn't falling naturally anymore—it swirled, forming massive serpentine shapes that writhed against the glass like living things trying to break through.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzZmMWE2NDViOTQ0OThiZGUyZjNiYmU2OWJjOTZl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">And in Sven's eyes, she saw something else: a red flicker, tentacles, a future not yet happened.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZmUyYjhiZTE4YjQ2Yjk5OGUxM2ExMjk4ZTc1Yzgy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The pendant burned against her skin. The world began to blur—</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYjcwZGE1OTc2NDQxNmJhMGUzYmY3OTAxZGYyOWI5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Sigrún, go! The vial – take it to Thorin. Tell him 'Måne kaller på måne' – Moon calls to moon."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNmFmZjJhYTNkMTRjZTM4MTlmZDZiM2FjODRhNDI4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"But Pappa—"</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZjdjNTNmZjkzOTRlMmRiNDkwY2IyNjVjMTMyODEx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"There's no time, Synne." His eyes flicked to Sven, nearly transformed, then back to her. "The vial. The pendant. Both must survive."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OTJlZjRlNDEwNDQ5ZGRhMmYyMmI5ZDA0ZTU4NWI0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"She could be magnificent, Harald!" Sven's roar shook the windows. "Like I!" His chest split open, showing chitinous plates. "I'll show her what we can become together!"</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MzYwOWFiMDA4MTRiMjk4NWZkZDNhYWU4N2UzYmRm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Two tentacles breached the barrier. Harald strained, silver light blazing from his hands. "Keep both safe. Promise me."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYzU3NzRjZDljNDRhZmU4NmQyYmM5OWFiOWNkMzUy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I...I..." her words failed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOTI3ZmQ0YWNjZDQwMzRhMjYxMTE1ZGVlYThlNjM2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Pendant of Mánagrát grew cold against her skin, its blue light fading to darkness. Her father... gone?</span></p>
