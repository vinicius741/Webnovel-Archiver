<span>
   “Get behind me,” Maeryn hissed, taking a few steps backward, and both Ernesto and Terrance hurried to follow her order. Her every instinct screamed danger, and fear had a tight grip on her stomach, but running wouldn’t do them any good.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Whoever this was,
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    whatever
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   this was, they needed answers. And the Undead needed to die tonight.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   As the Mist faded slightly, Maeryn spotted a source of light in the room beyond, illuminating it for the three to see. It was, in a word, homey. A comfortable-looking lounge chair, bookshelves of books lining the wall, even a rug on the floor. The light seemed to be coming from an oil lamp hung on a stand, providing a steady source of illumination.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The only exceptions to the otherwise nice decor was the swirl of Mist carpeting the floor, and the Undead corpse that was beginning to rise out of the lounge chair, putting down its book on a side table.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Well?” The Undead’s voice was rough, as if its throat were covered in sandpaper, but it still managed to sound vaguely impatient. “Come in. You’ve come all this way, you may as well finish the job.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn blinked, but slowly stepped inside, her companions silently following her lead. “You’re, um, a lot more sentient than I thought you’d be.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   A grating, almost hacking laugh emerged from the Undead’s throat. “No doubt. Well, I suppose introductions are in order.” The walking corpse inclined its head to them. “I am Keith of the noble family Laurant. And you are?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I think I’m dreaming,” Ernesto muttered. “Ow!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “You’re not dreaming, keep it together,” Terrance hissed, retracting his elbow from Ernesto’s side.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn tried her best to push past the surreality of her current situation and move forward. “... Right. Okay. I’m Maeryn d’Vert, Captain of the airship Stonewing. My companions are Terrance and Ernesto.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Charmed.” The Undead - Keith - nodded its head solemnly, and… did it just try to smile? The muscles and skin around its skull were too tight, but Maeryn could swear that they twitched around the jaw. “I do apologize that I lack seats for you. Please make yourselves comfortable. I imagine you have many questions, but if you’ll allow me, I’ll tell you the story from beginning to end.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn exchanged glances with her comrades. “Well, sure. Why not?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Excellent.” Keith sat back down in his recliner. “It’s not too long a tale, you see. Some seventy years ago, I was born into the Laurant family. I discovered my affinity for necromantic magic when I was a mere eleven years old, and - panicking as you might expect a boy to, when necromancers are put to death in our society - I told my parents and begged for help. They, being kind parents unwilling to let me be put to death by society for something I had no control over, arranged for this place to be built.” He gestured grandly at his facility. “And from then on out, this was my home, alongside a few trusted servants charged with my care. Unfortunately for me, my parents were killed only a handful of years later, and my cousins became aware of the facility. That was when I learned that my death had been faked - and my cousins were cruel people.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “What did they do?” Ernesto dared to ask.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Simple, really. They extorted me. They threatened to expose my existence if I didn’t follow their every whim.” Keith made an odd noise, as though he wanted to snort derisively, but it came out weirdly with his nose gone. “I, being a terrified teenager, could do nothing but obey. And under their direction, my powers grew. I became a necromancer in truth rather than in potential. Eventually, I scared my cousins enough that they tried to be rid of me. They locked me in here, blocked up the doors, and simply waited for me to die.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Keith shook his head. “They should have known better. A necromancer deals in death. As I slowly starved, I decided that even though my life had been spent in service to the family, I would spend my death
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    my way
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   . I turned myself into an Undead. And when my foolish cousins came to ensure that I was dead… they were mine. I took my time with them indeed.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The nostalgic vindictive pleasure that lined Keith’s voice at that point was impossible to deny, and it sent a wave of goosebumps up Maeryn’s arms.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Of course, their absence was noticed, and the Research Council became aware of my existence. It turned out that we had much to offer each other, really. I had no particular interest in the outside world, you see. I just wanted to survive in some form of comfort. The Research Council was amenable to that, so long as I cooperated with their experiments every now and then.” Keith shrugged.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Wait. Then that means… that the Research Council has been aware of the link between the Undead and the Mist…?!” Maeryn began, anger beginning to boil within her.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Oh, that? They’ve known that for, oh, I want to say a decade or so? The passage of time is sometimes hard to tell, but I’m sure it’s been at least seven or eight years. I told them straight away when they asked. No point in lying, considering my body constantly generates it.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “And they never told anyone…!” Maeryn breathed, her fists clenched so hard that her nails dug into her palms. “Everyone is in danger of dying to the Mist, and they withheld such crucial information for so long…?! We could have solved this by now! Why?! Why would they do this?!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Keith was completely unmoved by her anger. “I couldn’t really say, young lady. I do apologize for that, but like I said, I haven’t really paid much interest in the world since I became like this.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance stepped forward then, cutting off Maeryn’s outrage. “I take that to mean that you are also unaware of what the researchers here have been trying to do? What they use samples from you for?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “You are entirely correct. I do not know, nor do I care to know if I’m honest. So long as they keep to our deal, that is all I require.” Keith stood then, his movements surprisingly smooth despite the audible creaks and cracks of his decayed body. He went on to stretch his arms and neck, which crackled so loudly that Maeryn flinched. Then the sound grew even worse, a series of grotesque, almost-wet noises emerging as Keith methodically limbered his joints. She could hear Terrance gag behind her, and she couldn’t blame him in the slightest, considering that she was barely keeping her own bile down. She absolutely did not want to know what was going on under the surface.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Finally, Keith seemed to be finished, and his stance and mostly-frozen expression looked almost apologetic as he addressed them once more. “My deepest apologies, Maeryn d’Vert, Terrance, Ernesto.” He raised his right arm and pointed a decayed finger at them menacingly, where a tiny orb of blue and purple and black mana swirled into existence. “Regrettably, part of the terms of my arrangement is that I can’t really let anyone else leave here alive. I will hear your last words, should you have any.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn’s eyes went wide, her heart beginning to race as she came to terms with the fact that she was entering another life-or-death struggle. She immediately popped out her blades and fell into a ready stance, spreading her arms to either side to hopefully shock her companions into moving. “Terrance! Ernesto!” she called out, trying to lace her voice with confidence but hearing only panic. “He’s coming! Get ready! Spread out, don’t group up!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Taking her response as a refusal to succumb, Keith inclined his head agreeably.
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    “
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   Very well, a duel it is.” The mana sphere in front of his finger hummed ominously as it grew ever so slightly larger, its edges thrumming like a harp string, and Keith jabbed forwards as if using his decayed digit like a rapier. “
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Necrotic Ray.”
   </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The orb shattered, reforging itself into a jagged line of black-and-purple as it lanced out towards them, and Maeryn dove to the side to avoid it, rolling as she’d often practiced to avoid scraping anything on the stone floor. As she came back to her feet, Maeryn spotted Terrance darting to one side and Ernesto retreating to a darkened corner, electing to stay out of the fight. Good. Without a ranged spell or enough agility to avoid Keith’s magic, Ernesto was best off staying out of the way.
  </span>
</p>
<span>
<br/><br/>
</span>
<p>
<span>
   The Necrotic Ray splashed against the stone wall behind her with an odd crackling sound, but she didn’t look back to see what happened to it - she already had a good idea what the spell did, given its name. Hopefully the stone walls couldn’t rot too much.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance dashed past her with snakelike speed, drawing… something from a tiny holster at his side. It was odd - it looked like it had a rapier’s handle, and yet the blade’s length was little more than a dagger’s. Who would make a weapon like that? In any case, he drew it and held it like he might a proper sword, trying to strike Keith with a powerful lunge.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The Undead moved with an unnatural grace, moving to the side and slapping Terrance’s back as he passed.
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    “Chilling Touch.
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   ”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance cried out as frost bloomed across his back, crackling and searing through his skin, cold biting into his muscles and spreading quickly through his torso. He could swear his heart skipped a beat in response to the abrupt and painful shock, and he stumbled. Luckily, he was able to catch himself against a wall. “Empty night…!” he hissed in pain, clutching at his chest with his off-hand as he turned around, holding his weapon up unsteadily. “You’re fast.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I am,” Keith acknowledged. “And you are too inexperienced…” He had to cut himself off, as Maeryn tried to sneak attack him with a horizontal swipe across his back. He moved forward and to the side, narrowly evading the attack with a fluid, almost serpentine motion completely at odds with his corpse-like body. “That was rude,” he chided.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “So is trying to kill us!” Maeryn spat back, her voice lined with frustration and anger.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “True enough. That does put a damper on our relationship. Still, one must observe the niceties, even in a battle for one’s life.” Keith paused to effortlessly dodge a throwing knife sent from Terrance’s position. “I suppose, however, given the clear disparity in our skills, some rudeness must be tolerated by one in my position. Carry on, then. I wonder where your friend is, though…?” Maeryn’s eyes didn’t leave her opponent, and Keith nodded approvingly. “Ah, you’ve been trained. At least a little bit. Very well, shall we continue?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “If you’ve got something up your sleeves, Ernesto, now’d be the time!” Terrance called out, grimacing as he readied himself to continue the attack. His movements were stiff, and his body slow to respond, and everything he did tugged painfully at his frost-covered back, but he wasn’t done just yet.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Maeryn?!” Ernesto’s voice was desperate, but there was just enough resolve behind it to give the hunter some hope. “I’m ready! You’ll only get a second, I think!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Do it!” Maeryn ordered, rushing in, her blades dancing through the air as she struggled to get a hit, any hit on the Undead before her. But Keith weaved through her attacks with maddening ease, retaliating with his stiff, corpse-like hands, each enchanted with the pale icy blue of
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Chilling Touch
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   . She narrowly avoided one that came within inches of striking her chest, and her next exhale was visible in the frosty air. The message was clear: one hit and she was done.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Not for the first time, Maeryn regretted not having a long-distance weapon, or even a mid-range one. But there wasn’t time to focus on regrets, and she redoubled her focus on evasion.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance rejoined the battle, trying to hit Keith from the flank, only to have to leap backwards when the Undead shot another
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Necrotic Ray
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   at him. This time, Maeryn could see what happened to the stone wall it hit - it cracked, and visibly weakened, the stone shifting somewhat. Too many of those, and the ceiling might fall down on top of them.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   And then Ernesto’s voice rang through the room, the mana in the air seeming to actually quake with his voice as it filled the room, giving the words an odd echoing quality.
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    “Command Undead! STOP!”
   </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Impossibly, Keith froze in place, his movements arrested by the power of Ernesto’s command. “What…?!” he rasped, disbelief evident in his hollow voice. “A necromancer?!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   It was everything Maeryn needed. “
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Body Enhancement!
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   ” she breathed, feeling mana suffuse her tired body and reinvigorating her. In a flash of movement, she leapt forward with everything she had, her blades a blur of steel.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   In that moment, time stretched out before her as if she were living in slow motion. She saw Keith realize what was about to happen. She watched her blades appear on either side of Keith’s neck. And in that singular moment, she beheaded the Undead.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Keith’s body and head fell away from each other, and Maeryn stumbled, gagging as the black ichor immediately began spilling out from both body parts. She immediately buried her mouth into her hoodie to try to muffle the nauseatingly foul odor, though her efforts were stymied by the sound and smell of Terrance falling to his knees and retching only a few feet away from her. She couldn’t blame him, but she would have given a lot to be deaf and nose-blind at that moment, considering how hard her stomach was churning from the utterly rancid, disgusting scents and sounds in the air.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   A small part of Maeryn’s mind noted that Terrance’s vomit, terrible though it was, was still better-smelling than the supernaturally awful black gunk that oozed from Keith’s body and head.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Well, this is most unfortunate.” Maeryn almost jumped, whirling to face Keith’s disembodied head from where it sat in a pool of ichor. No throat, no lungs, but the skull was talking nonetheless. A chill travelled down her spine, and then crawled right back up it. “I guess this is the end, then.” the Undead observed resignedly.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   By the Unending Depths, no. Just, no. She had hit her limit dealing with the supernatural today. Enough was enough.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn began gathering the mana she needed in her left hand, retracting the blade as she flipped her palm up. Sparks began to gather in the air in front of her hand as she readied her spell, swirling and forming an orb of fire hovering in front of her palm. Time to burn him and be done with it.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Utterly disregarding her clear intent to finish the job, Keith continued his monologue. “That was well fought, I suppose. I certainly didn’t expect to see another necromancer. Ernesto, was it?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Y-yes…”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Don’t be so timid, it was your spell that won the battle. In any case…” Keith made a noise as if he was giving a huff. “I wish you luck. Don’t go down my route. I couldn’t taste a wind-forsaken thing when I became an Undead, and I find that I do regret that at least.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “... Right. I’ll remember that.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Good. Now then, Captain Maeryn… whenever you’re ready.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn glared at him, utterly incensed that Keith was still acting as if he were in control of everything, right when he was about to die - again! But the feeling faded. This was just how he was, she supposed. She sighed and refocused.
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    “Fireball.
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   ”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The flame spell struck Keith right in the forehead, and the skull was immediately covered in fire, consumed in a matter of seconds. Maeryn cast another Fireball on the body, and it too was completely reduced to ash unnaturally quickly, just like the Undead had been at Mount Peace.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The three of them stood there for several long seconds as the unspeakably foul odor rapidly faded away, slowly recovering from the exertion of battle.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Well. That happened,” Terrance finally said dryly.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Yep.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Is there, um, anything else we should be doing?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Nope. By the Depths, winds, or whatever else you wanna swear on, let’s get out of here,” Maeryn declared.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “You said it,” Terrance agreed wholeheartedly, and they quickly walked down the hallway. Without a word, he unlocked the door, let everyone through, then closed and relocked it. He stretched and winced, clutching at his back. “Skies above, I could really go for a hot shower. For hours. That
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Chilling Touch
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   was nasty. Ernesto, do you know that spell?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Um, actually, yes? My Master taught me.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Great. Any long term side effects I should worry about?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “There shouldn’t be if you get warmed up properly? It’s only if you get hit repeatedly that you might get frostbite.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance sighed in relief. “At least there’s that. Come on, let’s get back to the inn.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The rogue guided them through the same alleyways and side passages as he had getting them there, and eventually they arrived at the inn. Wearily, the three of them stepped through the front door.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Gerald looked up at them from his counter. Maeryn blinked at him slowly. Seriously, how was he still awake at this hour? How was he awake at
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    every
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   hour, every time Maeryn was here?
  </span>
<em>
<span>
</span>
</em>
<span>
   “Are… you three alright?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Just exhausted,” Maeryn replied tiredly. “And in need of a hot shower. We’re gonna head to our rooms. Also, do you ever sleep?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I… yes? Of course I sleep.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “When?” Maeryn pressed, only for Terrance and Ernesto to both take her by an arm and start dragging her up the stairs. “No! I need to know! When?!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Gerald only laughed and waved goodbye as the three of them left his sight.
  </span>
</p>
