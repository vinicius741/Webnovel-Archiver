  Starting in Volume 1.5, words in the language of angels (
  <em>
   jolasin)
  </em>
  start showing up. I've always wanted angels to have their own language, but I struggled a lot with this issue over the years. Although I am interested in linguistics and such, I find the prospect of making up a language from scratch to be a massive time waste. I really want to spend my time writing! Therefore, I decided to adopt a real-world conlang instead, and just say that in Gaia that conlang simply was never invented, and the creators used it for the angels instead.
 </p>
 <p>
  I went back and forth a lot on which conlang to use, since it had to have very specific requirements:
 </p>
 <p>
  * It had to be an
  <em>
   a priori
  </em>
  language, meaning its vocabulary couldn't be based on existing languages (for lore reasons).
 </p>
 <p>
  * It had to be logical, and I had to be able to make my own words.
 </p>
 <p>
  * It had to be relatively easy to pronounce.
 </p>
 <p>
  * It had to be obscure enough that it made sense for it to not exist in my world (for example, Esperanto or even Toki Pona are important in the history of conlangs).
 </p>
 <p>
  The language I ended up choosing is called
  <strong>
   Sona
  </strong>
  by Kenneth Searight. It is very obscure, so much so that I don't think there's any community online for it, and the only material published for it as far as I can tell is the original booklet. The basic concept is that there are 360 basic radicals with different meanings (kinda like chinese characters), and you combine them to create new words.
 </p>
 <p>
  So for example, the word
  <em>
   jolasin
  </em>
  means "sacred language", where
  <em>
   jo
  </em>
  is the radical meaning God,
  <em>
   la
  </em>
  means tongue, and
  <em>
   sin
  </em>
  means shape or form (
  <em>
   lasin
  </em>
  is the word in Sona for language). Sona sounds a bit like Japanese, since it lacks combinations of consonants without vowels, but it has some sounds and combination of sounds not seen in Japanese.
 </p>
 <p>
  Apparently I can't add links to a chapter body, so I'll leave a few in the post-chapter note if you want to know more about Sona.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Changes from Sona
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Sona isn't perfect for my usage, and so I'm constantly thinking about changes to it. The main one is about the sound of
  <em>
   y
  </em>
  . In Sona it represents the sound made in English words like "yellow". However, I find this sound to be a bit awkward, especially the combination "yi". I decided to therefore change it to the portuguese sound "lh" or the english
  <em>
   ll
  </em>
  sound in
  <em>
   million
  </em>
  . It might be a bit difficult to pronounce for some people, but I think it's fun and solves my main problem with the language.
 </p>
 <p>
  I also decided to forgo the rule that only foreign words are written with capital letters.
  <em>
   Jolasin
  </em>
  works like English.
 </p>
 <hr/>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Alphabet, because I can't make things simple
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Sona is normally written in the Latin alphabet, but I'm proposing a writing system based on the Shavian alphabet, which was originally made to spell English phonetically. These symbols exist in Unicode so they should display properly in every browser... I hope. So, for example,
  <em>
   jolasin
  </em>
  would be written as
  <span>
   𐑡𐑵𐑞𐑩𐑕𐑽
  </span>
  . Looks cool, right?! Now you know what
  <em>
   jolasin
  </em>
  looks like written down. Of course, it can be used to write a word or proper noun from another language:
  <span>
   ·
  </span>
  𐑕𐑢𐑦𐑦𐑠𐑩 is "Shiina" and
  <span>
   ·
  </span>
  𐑑𐑔𐑩𐑦𐑑𐑨
  <span>
   ·
  </span>
  𐑢𐑨𐑜𐑟𐑩𐑜𐑹 is "TriteHexagon" (spelled phonetically). By the way, see those dots? Shavian doesn't have capital letters, so you put a dot before given names.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here's the table with the Latin characters and the symbols in Shavian. Note that the value of each symbol can deviate wildly from their original values in English Shavian. English has a lot more sounds than Sona, and I wanted to make it so vowels were always on the baseline, and consonants all went up or down the baseline, so I had to change some symbols' values here and there. I also switched around the
  <em>
   m
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   n
  </em>
  sounds from Sona's position in the table of radicals, but it doesn't really affect anything other than giving
  <em>
   n
  </em>
  that specific symbol, which was what I wanted.

  As you can see,
  <em>
   y
  </em>
  has two symbols: 𐑴 represents the schwa (used in Sona in some edge cases), while 𐑰 represents the aforementioned "lh" sound (it is the only consonant written on the baseline).
 </p>
 <p>
  Shavian also allows for something really cool: ligatures. Basically, in Sona, radicals can end in a vowel + an
  <em>
   n
  </em>
  sound (what I'm calling the
  <em>
   -yn
  </em>
  radicals). This would take up 2 letters to write. However, Shavian naturally has ligature symbols, so I adopted them for my usage. Most of them are combinations of vowels and
  <em>
   r
  </em>
  in English Shavian (the original symbol for
  <em>
   r
  </em>
  was on the baseline, so I didn't use it in
  <em>
   jolasin
  </em>
  ), but the symbol I adopted for
  <em>
   n
  </em>
  is very close to it, so the ligatures work out nicely. These ligatures are why the word
  <em>
   jolasin
  </em>
  is written
  <span>
   𐑡𐑵𐑞𐑩𐑕𐑽
  </span>
  and not
  <span>
   𐑡𐑵𐑞𐑩𐑕𐑦𐑠 (but the latter way is also correct!)
