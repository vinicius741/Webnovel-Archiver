Simple emotions from the big one. Right now, a sort of lazy feeling, like someone trying to nap. The smaller ones are between the lower deck’s floor plate and the hull. The bigger one is hiding somewhere in a hollow between the two decks.” I held up a hand, projecting an illusion created from a detection formula ping through the ship, showing a small red blob squeezed into the improbably tight space that was a cable conduit, which ran from the front of the ship to the back and had regular access hatches—along with a cluster of three much smaller red dots below the lower deck. “The smaller ones feel vaguely dark in the Force, but I’m not sensing danger.”</p>

You see, the deal our previous king made with the Trade Federation may have benefited our government in the short term, but left us without any way of taking over and exploiting our own resources. None of our people have been trained in how to run the plasma extractors, and I know for a fact that the Trade Federation sells it at twenty times the price it should.”</span></p>

<hr/>
<p class="cnNkN2M3ZTFmNGUzMjQwNjM5NmIxN2NkYjM5YzlkZGFl" style="margin-bottom: 0">Grand Master Yoda sat outside in one of the few green spaces within the Temple, drinking a cup of tea as he watched the sun set over Coruscant. He sat not in silent contemplation, but simply in silence. Feeling the world around him as he extended his senses. His goal was to clear his mind and free himself of distractions—he had needed it, after the High Council session earlier that day. Unfortunately, that was proving difficult.</p>
<p class="cnMxN2I4MTlkNjU3YzQwMWZiZDMxZTJlNDY0ZDY3ZGJi" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM2ZDNkNTFhYWU4YzQyNmJiM2U2ZmNhZjQ5M2FlYjA3" style="margin-bottom: 0">The Temple and the Jedi within it were a familiar presence, but now that he knew it was there, that it had been pointed out to him, Yoda could feel the shroud of the dark side of the Force all around them. It hung like a thick curtain of webs over the temple, the space within its grounds filled with smoke that his senses had difficulty penetrating. All of the comfort and reassurance he used to take in the silence of the outside world within the temple was gone, now that he knew those things were only because the longer he stayed within its grounds, the more he was blinded to what was going on outside.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZWIwZTgxOTM5YzRmNGY4MDYzNGRjMTUxNGI0ZWM1" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnNlNzY2YmRmOTJlOTQwNDM5YjI4MDc1NTc1Nzc1ODg0" style="margin-bottom: 0"><em>No. Blind I have been, to the goings on within the temple. Too long, this has been allowed to go on. An end we must seek and our wrongs must we right.</em></p>

<p class="cnM2YjdlNDU4M2U2OTQ4YWM4NTJiYzk0YWE3Y2Q0NzM3" style="margin-bottom: 0">They needed to put their house in order. And it had to start from the top.</p>

<p class="cnNkZGQ2ZGMxYjY0OTRmOWE5Y2FjYzNlMDAzODY3Mjg2" style="margin-bottom: 0">Feeling a familiar presence, he gestured and the kettle of tea poured out a second cup. There was a soft rustle of cloth as Mace sat beside him and took the offered cup. Sensing the conflict within the human, Yoda sat in silence and sipped at his tea, waiting for Mace to speak. When he did not after roughly five minutes by Yoda’s count, the old Grand Master hummed and finally asked, “What troubles you so?”</p>
<p class="cnM3MzZmYjNhN2M1NTQzMmFhMGE3Nzg0YmE0YzQ2NTZm" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM2NThiMmViNDE4ODRjY2ZhYTEwODdhMjVkNTdmMTVj" style="margin-bottom: 0">Mace took a breath and said the two words Yoda had begun to suspect, the longer Mace’s silence went on. “Tanya Mereel.”</p>

<p class="cnNkMmFmOTRkYWJjYzQ0ZGM5ZWQ3ODkxZGM3MGQ0MTYw" style="margin-bottom: 0">Nodding, Yoda took a moment to refill his cup. “Troubling, she is. Willful. Someone who prefers decisive action. Reminds me of someone, she does.”</p>
<p class="cnMxNzA3ZGM3ZDFiYjRjNjI4ZDUyNjNjYjFhODEwZWEx" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnNiMjgyY2NiMzk2ODQ3ZWFiYzBjZmZmNjlmMjZhYzQz" style="margin-bottom: 0">The Master beside him snorted quietly. “I was never that bad.”</p>
<p class="cnMxYjVmOGU3NzAxOTQzMDg5MWIyMzJkNTEyYjE4YjE5" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM5MTJhNGViNGRiYzRkYzc4MWQ3ODY5N2VlYjU5NDY0" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Worse, you were,” Yoda smiled. “Know where the line is, she does. You did not.” Glancing at Mace, he continued, “But that is not the problem that troubles you, I sense. Something new, this is. A burden shared is a burden halved. Tell me.”</p>
<p class="cnMxZDgyN2MyMTcxNTRiMGNiNjA5Y2FkNTg3MGU4MTY1" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnNkNTZlYmMyYWJjNjRjODlhZDNhNDkxOGY1ZGNmNWM1" style="margin-bottom: 0">Mace stared into his tea cup for a while before nodding. “I confronted her. We had a conversation and sparred.” Glancing at Yoda out of the corner of his eye, Mace continued, “She feels the Order has become weak and corrupt.”</p>
<p class="cnM3MzM2NTIzNTgzZTRjNGI5ZTJiMjBmNWI0YTM2Y2E1" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnNkMWIzZjU2MTEzMDQ2YWM4MDQwNDMwMTI4OTVjYWJm" style="margin-bottom: 0">Taking in a deep breath, Yoda let it out in a long sigh, and nodded once. “Sense this is what troubles you, I do not,” he pointed out, knowing this had long been a point of contention between them.</p>
<p class="cnNjNmEyZjQ5ODhlMTQ1Y2FhODAzZjRiNjgzMGJjODIz" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM1ZjUzNjhmZjE5ZDRkNTdiZDhhZWMzMGYwYzFkMjEw" style="margin-bottom: 0">Now, finally, it seemed Mace had been proven right and Yoda’s faith that the Order had not become corrupt, weak, and stagnant but rather had simply adapted to a modern, more enlightened era was finally being completely eroded out from under him. It was saddening to think about. Frustrating, as well. But more than anything, it was disappointing. And of course, there was that nagging feeling that of everyone in the temple, as the oldest and the one who had influenced practically all of them at one point or another, Yoda was the most responsible for this failure.</p>
<p class="cnNjYjRjMDM2MzcxZjRiOGVhYmU4OGI0YWRkNmJjYzdl" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnMxMjdiMzMxZGIwYjQxZTRhYmNkYjJlNDhkZDE5YTg5" style="margin-bottom: 0">“No,” Mace confirmed. “When we sparred, she demonstrated abilities in the Force I’ve never seen before. A shield that it took Shatterpoint to break. A blade that cut through durasteel more effectively than a lightsaber.”</p>
<p class="cnNjOTNlOTVjYzhlZTQ0MGE5NjM1YzBjMzU1YTEzZjNi" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnNiNjcyOWRiOGMzNTQwMDQ5YTI5YzIxMDZjMDU4NDc0" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Mm. Yes. Strange, they are. Very rigid. Meticulous. But dark, they are not,” Yoda murmured, and Mace shook his head.</p>
<p class="cnMzY2E0M2Y3OTNiYzQyYjhiMTI2N2IwZjcyMjRhZjRh" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnNjYjUzZDhhMmI2MDQ2ZWU4YjA5YjkwNjU1YTYzZTEy" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Afterwards, I asked her how she knew them. She told me.” Yoda nodded, waiting for Mace to continue. “Apparently, she’s a reincarnation, twice over. Mundane the first time, <em>s</em><em>omething like</em><span style="font-style: normal"> an ancient Force user </span><span style="font-style: normal">the second</span><span style="font-style: normal">, in her own words. </span>A child soldier, in a war fought with the Force.

<p class="cnNlZDVmNmZkMjM1MjRjYjg4NTA4ZTU4MzlhNGY3N2Uy" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal">Mace shook his head. “If you look at what she’s done so far, she’s always tried a peaceful solution first if it was available.

There are </span><em>enough</em><span style="font-style: normal"> people on the High Council who either feel that Tanya antagonized him into responding, feel like she’s dangerous, or believe that the dark side influence of the Force nexus under the temple clouded Mundi’s judgment enough to cause him to act rashly that we’ll never get the votes needed for anything decisive.”</span></p>

This would serve as a good lesson to the others that not even those on the High Council were above discipline, even if it must come in a roundabout form.
