<p class="cnM4N2FlNGIxOGE1MDQxNWJiMGNkNWFmMDFmYmVlZTZm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><strong>07:47, March 19, 2295 </strong></span></p>
<p class="cnNlY2EwNjRlZTI1MzRiZmE5OTYzZjhlN2U1NDdmMWEx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">VIP Lounge 7, Flanders Poppy Manor, 18987 Coldstream Road, Truckee, CA 96161, Golden State Republic territory</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMzM5ZDIzYmZmYjQ2NDJhODQzZmU3NWFiYjU4NTIz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The VIP lounge smelled of fresh coffee, buttery croissants, and something else - a faint chemical smell that reminded Lorna of hospital sanitizer. Morning sunlight streamed through floor-to-ceiling windows, casting long shadows across polished floors.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzE5N2Q5YmQ4NjQ2YzliNzI1ZTc2ZmQ1ZGQ5OGYx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Several 5th-generation androids moved around the area, carrying newly prepared dishes. Their gleaming yellow heads shone as they carried out their tasks in silent efficiency.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNGMzMzEwNzMxYjQzYWI4OTViYzdjYjM1NWVkMmI3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Breakfast covered the central table: steaming eggs benedict, fresh fruit arranged in spirals, and what looked like genuine Norwegian gravlaks - a detail that didn't escape Lorna's notice. The room spoke of calculated wealth: plush leather chairs, abstract art in golden frames, and security cameras disguised as lighting fixtures.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OTBkZTEwZjM1NDRmNzNhNGM1Mzg3NDJlY2JlMTUw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Please, help yourselves," Reeves's hologram appeared and gestured toward the food, his golden suit somehow more radiant in this projected form. He pulled out an expensive-looking cigarette from a silver case, the motion fluid despite being incorporeal. "I offer only the best to friends of mine."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNTFjNzE5ZGQyMTQyYWI4ZjA1M2JiMWRkY2M0NjBm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Diego headed to the food spread. But Xin remained beside Lorna, his posture tense. The engineer's earlier revelation about the Crystal still hung between them.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZWQ1NGFhMTdjODRmNjE5MmMzM2I1MzE3MDQzY2Yz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You shouldn't have told them, Xin. We can't be sure if they're friend or foe." She looked at him, disapproval in her voice.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5N2JmMjZlOWQ3MzRkNWRiZjMwNzlkYzdkZTZlNmY4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"It was the only way I knew to defuse the situation without risking harm." Xin pressed his lips together as he met her stare.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNjMxMmU0ZWUyODQ0MjE4MjNmNGU5NmM2NjM2NzY2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"In the future, ask for my permission first." Her eyes narrowed.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNzkwMWVhYTljZDQ2Yzg4NzM3Zjk4ZmM1Yjk5OTE0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Of course, I will." He nodded, raising a hand to scratch at his scalp.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OTNmNzMxOWFlNTQ3MjZiZTIxNzEzZmZmMzdmMjUz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Håkon had already left his perch on Lorna's shoulder. The young Diabolisk's sapphire scales lightened as he investigated a quantum clock on the far wall, his head tilting at the soft blue glow from its internal mechanisms.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjA4NmRlNDNmNzQyMTI5YzAyNzEzZTM0YWU4Y2U3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Through their connection, Lorna felt his curiosity like gentle waves:</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MThhMTE3NWEwZDQ3NzdhNjc2YWYxYTdiOTYwZWZh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><em>Pretty-light-tick-time-what? </em></span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZmQ2N2MzODY4YzRhY2RiYmQ0NTFmYjhlMTljMDEz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The innocent wonder in his thoughts brought a small smile to her lips despite the tension.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMTcyM2ZhNzI2ZDQ3NDg4YjlhNTZkMTA3NTg3M2Yz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The art is exquisite, isn't it?" Reeves's hologram moved toward one of the golden-framed pieces, smoke curling from his cigarette. "A Monet rescued from San Francisco before the Digital Era collapse. One of the few originals that survived."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZjI3MWYxMzhmZDQ2Mzc5YWFjMGQwMWNlM2U0MGI5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna caught Xin's glance and gave him a subtle nod toward the food. As he hesitantly approached the table and picked up a few Californian rolls, she studied Reeves's projected form. Despite his casual demeanor, something felt off about the way his hologram interacted with the room's lighting.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjI5OTJlZGU2ZjRjMjk5N2M1OWMxNTY0MjQxODM5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You didn't bring us here to discuss art, Chief Executive," she said, moving to pick up a piece of gravlaks with a fork. The fish's familiar taste brought memories of Oslo's morning markets.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNDRiN2FjZjg4NDQ3OTk5YjFlYjJhMzk3YjRjNGVl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Direct. I appreciate that." Reeves took a long drag from his cigarette, its ember glowing unnaturally bright in his holographic hand. "Just as I appreciated your colleague's directness about the Moondust Crystal."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZjM2ZWU0YjdiMTQ5YWZhMmQ5Yzk3ZWI2ODVhZWQy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna's jaw tightened. Beside her, she felt Xin stiffen.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZWQ5YWJiNjlkZDRjYzQ5ZWFhMDI0NTI2N2YwZTY3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The xenologists at Stanford believe it is capable of mind control and other psychological warfare unachievable by human technologies," Reeves continued, his voice carrying through hidden speakers as he paced. "Tell me, what would the Terra Alliance want with an artifact of such... specific capabilities?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NGUzNjg1ZjUwNDQzZjBiNTdjMDEwZTNlYjE3OGNj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">At the far end of the room, Håkon had discovered a fusion-powered aquarium. The Diabolisk pressed his snout against the glass, trilling softly at the exotic fish within. His thoughts came sparkling with delight:</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOTQyM2IyYzBmMzRjY2Y5YTViN2E4MjAyOTY0ZDY2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><em>Swimming-lights-pretty-friends-water-play?</em></span></p>
<p class="cnM1NjBhZDc0NDhjYzQ3ODI4MGUyODJhZTkyYzgxMjJk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I'm not at liberty to discuss that," Lorna replied, noting how Diego had positioned himself with a clear view of both exits while appearing to focus on his eggs benedict.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNzViZWZiYzFiZjQ1ZDQ5Y2FjZWMwM2U4M2ViNmRk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Come now," Reeves's smile didn't reach his eyes as his hologram gestured. "We're all friends here. Under my administration, the GSR has maintained cordial relations with the Alliance. Even during the more... complicated periods of our shared history."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZDg4OTZkYzhjNzRkYzI5ZTQyODM5MjUzODZjZmU3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Right. Cordial relations," Lorna echoed, skepticism in her tone. "And your border guards were more than ready to confiscate Håkon the moment you saw him."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNzRkZjI1MTY3ZDQ2NGNiNDNlYmIzNDQwODVjOTMw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Since the end of Digital Era, California has been at the forefront of progressivism. Gender-affirming care, universal basic income, and more." Reeves's hologram moved to the window, gazing out at the snow-capped Sierra Nevada. "But a utopian society like ours requires constant vigilance. From Alliance spies, Imperium assassins to new types of Radi-Mons. Surely you understand the need for caution?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTg0OTJkMDgwYjQ0Y2RiMDFjMWQ4YzgzYzIwN2Q4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I wouldn't call a country with a 60% income tax rate and police arresting people for swearing in public a 'utopia', but you're welcome to your opinion." Lorna's reply carried just enough bite to make her point.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNjBmNWJiOGNmYzQzNTI4MmM1MDI3YjMxNWMzOWQy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The subtle hum of quantum processors beneath the floorboards seemed to intensify. Lorna noticed how the security cameras tracked Håkon's movements as he investigated a decorative fusion lamp, his tail swaying with curiosity.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYTZhODY1NGMxMDQ4NWE5YzZmZDEyNTk1NzNmMDJk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Hey, Xin. Can you?" Lorna said softly, tilting her head toward their youngest companion.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDU4MGZhYzA3ZjQ5MzY4ZTUyZDIwMGNkMzBmNzc0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yep." Xin nodded, setting down his plate and walking toward Håkon, who now had his front legs lifted and placed on the fusion lamp's glass surface, his scales reflecting its glow. The Diabolisk made several lighthearted chirps, like a child's giggles echoing through the room.</span></p><span class="cmExYzQxNzllZjJlYTQ1ZTliNDBmNjVkZjMyMmI0YzMx"><br/>The tale has been stolen; if detected on Amazon, report the violation.<br/></span>
<p class="cnMyMWRmNmRhYmI5ODQ5YjQ4NzA1ZGRlN2I5MmIwN2M0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"We're getting off track," Reeves's hologram cut in, his projected form turning to face them fully. Smoke surrounded his features as he continued, "The Fenris Horde grows bolder across the Five Realms. Meanwhile, my sources report increased activity from both Imperium and Alliance fleets, here on Earth and on Venus. I know your nations both seek to find and use the Moondust Crystal, willing to tear the other one down to do so."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhM2JiNjNhODljNTRkNDI4ZWY5MzVlNmM4NDM3ODEw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Diego paused mid-bite, his fork hovering over his eggs benedict as he exchanged a meaningful glance with Lorna.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MWY0ZTFkNzdmZDQyNDI4ZDhmYzNmYTZlM2MyZmNl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Alright, boy. That's not safe to play with." Xin cooed from the other side of the room, his hands gently scooping Håkon away from the fusion lamp.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZDRlYzBlMWM3ZDRjNTg5MGQ3MTk2NzFlNTY3NzYz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">But the Diabolisk immediately let out a sharp, distressed chirp that echoed through the lounge. His sapphire scales darkened rapidly as he squirmed in Xin's arms, head craning back toward the lamp with increasing agitation.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDI5ZjQ3YWRiZTRhZWZiZWY3MGIwY2M5NTI3YWRh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Hey, hey, it's okay," Xin tried to soothe him, but Håkon's distress only intensified. The young Diabolisk's cries grew louder, more insistent, his dark blue scales now almost navy as his tail thrashed against Xin's forearm.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMmNlNDFmZmY3ODQ4NDY5N2I5MDE1MzdiMTRmZmZh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Maybe give the little one something to eat?" Diego suggested from the table, amusement in his voice as he watched Xin struggle. "Works with my nephew whenever he gets fussy."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiODI1NGFmYzNhMzQ1N2NiNjQwNzUxMjMwZGM0ZTQy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin scanned the breakfast spread, his eyes lighting up at a particular dish. "The eggs," he said, moving carefully toward the table while trying to contain the squirming Diabolisk. "Easy to digest for reptiles. Rich in protein, too."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhY2I1ZGIwNGRlNzQ0MWVhY2FhYmZhOTQ4ZDZmOTg0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Keeping one arm firmly around Håkon, Xin managed to scoop a small portion of scrambled eggs onto a dessert spoon. He offered it to the distressed Radi-Mon, who initially turned away with another sharp cry.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NGQ1ZGZjYWJlOTQ1ZjY5OTZlYmZlZjgzMjY3MWJh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Mamma eats it, too, you know." Xin kept calm, holding the spoon closer to Håkon's snout as his gaze darted to Lorna. "Isn't that right, Lorna?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZDY5OTQyOWNkMDQyODA5MzdmOThiYWNlMzQ1Zjc3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yeah." Lorna let out a nervous chuckle as she eyed Håkon with concern.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OTliNTcxMzE0MTQwMGE5ZjhiZDRlZDhhOGVmMDE3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The little Diabolisk's nostrils flared as he caught the scrambled eggs' scent, his cries gradually diminishing to curious chirps.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNDMzMjI3YjQwOTRkNzg4ZDlmOGIwNWRkOGZiNjVj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Come on, try it." Xin encouraged softly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTEzM2Y0ODcxZDRjYzBiYzQzZThjNWY2ODEwZjg5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">After a moment's hesitation, Håkon delicately took the eggs from the spoon with his tiny mandibles. His scales began to lighten as he chewed, returning to their usual sapphire hue before shifting to an even brighter shade of blue. He trilled with contentment, nuzzling against Xin's chest as his tail curled around the engineer's forearm.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTQ4NjU1NmQ0YTQ0MzdhNTg2NzYxYmFiZmQwM2Ix"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yeah, who's a good boy. Who's the goodest boy," Xin praised in relief, his voice taking on that gentle, singsong quality adults used with small children as he took another spoonful of egg. "Want more?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MTA2N2Y4NjY0OTRkNmJhMjhkMzI4ZTQ4MzFlYWRk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Håkon rolled onto his back in Xin's arms, tiny clawed hands reaching eagerly for the offered spoon. His scales began to shimmer, transforming into a blend of pale blue and warm gold that caught the morning light.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMGE3NDQ5ZWQzNjQyNDI5M2RlZTYzNjIzODAyNjQ2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna watched with a relieved smile - over the past week, she'd learned to read her son's color changes. The golden hue usually appeared when Håkon felt safe and happy. The sight of him happily accepting another bite of egg from Xin brought warmth to her chest.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3M2IzYzY4MjBjNDRkY2Q4ZTE4N2E3YjY2MGJiZDUx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Through their psychic bond came another message: <em>Father-Xin-feeds-family-safe</em>.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZDAxM2Y2NzY1MjRhZTM4ZDIyMDM0ZWY1OWVmZjk4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The word 'father' in Håkon's thoughts made Lorna's breath catch. When had he started thinking of Xin that way?</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTFhZGZiNzE0OTQwMWU4MzEyZTA2ZTAyNmQ5NGQ0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Family. It is important, yes?" Reeves's hologram flickered slightly as he took another drag from his cigarette. "Which brings us back to the Crystal. An artifact capable of compelling minds on a cosmic scale, including those of Radi-Mons. Thousands of families could be saved, if wielded by the right people."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YWU2ZTYxNzliNDQyYTZhZTljOTBjZTY5NDAyZTQy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The room's temperature seemed to drop. Lorna maintained her composed expression, but her fingers instinctively brushed against her coat. "You have a proposition."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMzFmODkwYmU0ZDRkZDg5ZjkyNDM1YWFlZGE3OGQz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I could make this considerably easier for your team," Reeves offered, his projected form moving closer to where Lorna stood. "Unrestricted access to GSR territory. Cooperation from local authorities. A squad of my Pomo Wardens to aid your investigations, plus reinforcements as you make progress in locating the artifact."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMTY0ODc0MmIxNDRkODg4ZGFiMTM3ZjgxZTAyZjQ1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"And what would you want in return?" Lorna asked, though she already knew the answer. The gravlaks's taste lingered on her tongue as she mixed a small bowl of salad.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNjc1NjFiOTQ4MjQzNmFiZWUzYWI5MzhlYzcwMjli"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"A reasonable share of influence, once the Crystal's power is secured." Reeves's hologram took a long drag, the scentless smoke curling in patterns. "The election for Chief Executive approaches, and I intend to secure my position."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZGZmMjlkMjQ1YjRhNDE4ODFiYTQ3MTFkODZjN2E0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Okay, boy. No scratching or touching anything too hot, alright?" Beside them, Xin finished feeding Håkon, setting aside the dessert spoon and patting the Diabolisk's head.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZTIzMGRmMTNjMjQxY2U5NGE0NTUyZjU2YzU2OWNh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Håkon nodded and chirped in understanding, his large sapphire eyes glinting as he rolled and leapt down from Xin's arms. He crawled toward the other side of the room, this time with more careful movements.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MGM1NTAxNGQ1NjRmYWQ5ZDM0OTcwMzQyOWQ2ZmMw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"If I were to venture a guess, this election would involve manipulation, defamation, or elimination of potential rivals?" Diego murmured into his coffee cup, just loud enough to be heard. "Not implying any of those is wrong, in a modern political setting."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNWU2MWUwYWQyMDRkOWY4YWEyM2FlYTNjMzMzYzgx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Reeves's laugh carried no warmth. "An astute observation, Mr. Rodriguez. But my administration has been consistent in funding programs that keep our citizens safe and content, ensuring no beggars walk our streets."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNzE5NDUyZmM2MjQ5YzNiMzA4NWMyZDRhMjE1Y2Y5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Will you restore cooperation with the Terra Alliance if things work in your favor?" Lorna helped herself to a cup of hot coffee as she finished her salad.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NmE4ZWY0OGZiZDRhMmE5MjFlZWVmZjEwOWQzZTVm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">An android entered silently, placing a plate of freshly baked toast and jam packets on the table before bowing and departing. The aroma of warm bread filled the air.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNTAwMzI2YTRlMDQ5YTE4ZTU0M2UyMTM5NWRmMmMw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"That could be arranged." Reeves raised a holographic hand. "But until the Radi-Mon crisis is addressed domestically, I prefer maintaining the status quo in terms of foreign relations."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NDc0YjNiNmFjMTQ3Nzc4ZmFkN2Q0MTYwY2QzNjdl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Diego?" Lorna turned to the Novian, looking at him expectantly.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDlhYWUyNDQ5MTRlYjJhN2IzNzQyZWNmNzQxY2Ri"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I'll notify Director Otis about what we've discussed in this conversation." Diego helped himself to a generous portion of the bread loaf before holding up his half-full coffee cup.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZjgwYjJiN2NmNDRkZDc4ZmE3ZmM5N2FmZDIyNmNi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Que tenga un buen mandato, señor Reeves. Que la fortuna le sonría." he offered with diplomatic grace, raising his cup.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNjU2NDk2YTdkNDQ3OTVhZTVlNzQxYzY1MmJhNjhm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Gracias, Señor Rodriguez. Su cortesía me honra." Reeves's hologram inclined his head with practiced charm.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZTYwNDYwNDM5MDRlOTM4YzMxYThiMDI1MTkxNmE0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"And thank you for the breakfast." Xin made a cautious smile at the Chief Executive's hologram as he applied a packet of blueberry jam to his toast.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5M2FiZTczYjhmNzQ1ODY5Mzk3MTFhYWZmMTQyZDQ4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"It is my pleasure," Reeves gestured his cigarette toward Håkon, who had discovered a shelf of antique Digital Era tablets. "Your young Radi-Mon seems quite comfortable here."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNjM5ZTE5YjY0ZTRmODg4NWQ4ZTcxNGY1OTk1Mjk2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Håkon had settled on his haunches, sapphire scales reflecting the tablets' soft glow as he studied their displays with childlike fascination. One screen showed an old satellite map of Yosemite Valley, its topography rendered in precise detail.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NzUwNDMwNGU1MzQ5NTJiNTIxMTU0YzNjYTg4NzVk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">From the little Diabolisk came a psychic flutter mixed with unease: <em>know-place-cold-mountains-danger-there</em>.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZDY4NGRlODIwNDQwMjE5OWE2NDYzODhhMDk5OWQ3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna reached a hand to her amulet, surprised. How could he possibly recognize Yosemite?</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NTFkODRlYTliYzQ1NzhiYmEyYTI4YTBhNjA4OWFl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">But then realization struck her. Of course - Sven had ventured to Yosemite for a solitary summer excursion. She'd remained behind, consumed by her academic pursuits at the time.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOTE3MjA1MmE2ZTQwNmJiZGU0NjRlZWNkZGVkZmU5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"He has good taste in literature," Lorna replied carefully. "Though I notice your security systems are particularly interested in his movements."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZWU2ZDA1OGM2MTRiMGY4Y2E3MDRjMTQwMTQxZmM3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Standard monitoring protocols. Nothing more." Reeves's hologram crushed out his cigarette in a nearby ashtray, the ember disappearing too quickly to be natural. "In any event, I look forward to our cooperation."</span></p>
