   </span>
   he first light of dawn pierced the horizon as Xin and Lorna pulled up to a deserted stretch of I-57. The highway stretched beneath a cold morning sky, its cracked pavement adding to the emptiness. Lorna barely spoke as they got out of the vehicle.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin looked over the Space Rover, taking in its massive tires and white armored plating marked with battle scars. A Gauss Machine Gun sat mounted on top, its barrel pointing skyward. Even sitting still, the Rover looked intimidating with its dark-tinted windows.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "We only have another day before the Osram mission begins. Get yourself familiar with the controls," Lorna said flatly, gesturing towards the Space Rover. The scar on her left cheek from their time in Taiwan made her look even more serious.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Swallowing hard, Xin climbed into the driver's seat and adjusted the harness. The instrument panel was an intimidating array of buttons, switches, and dials.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "These Rovers were used in off-world missions. They've survived harsh conditions that could kill a man in seconds. Osram, Mars, Venus, Io. You name it," Lorna said distantly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As he finally took the wheel, the vehicle lurched awkwardly. Xin could feel Lorna watching him, and his hands shook slightly on the controls.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Every mistake felt worse with the silence between them, and Xin couldn't shake the feeling that he was out of his depth.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Focus," Lorna snapped. "We don't have all day."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Right," Xin clenched his jaw and took a deep breath.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "More throttle control," Lorna instructed sharply. "You need to feel the engine beneath you — balance the weight distribution between the front and rear tires. Remember, everything out there wants to kill you, even the gravity."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That's what people on the Extranet say, yeah," Xin replied.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "In '91, on Osram, we were in a canyon. Threw one of these into a tight corner too fast, and we lost half the Vanguard marines. The Rover flipped, sent them crashing into a rock wall."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin's heart pounded as he drove through the deteriorating highway. This wasn't just practice; it was a test to see if he could survive in her world. The Rover responded sluggishly to his touch.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Switch seats, now," Lorna commanded. As they changed places, Xin noticed the darkness in her eyes.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The moment Lorna took control, the Rover moved effortlessly, gliding across the battered highway at high speed. Her movements were fluid and controlled, yet there was something almost reckless in how she pushed the machine.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Watching her, Xin felt both admiration and unease — he wanted to connect with her, but it seemed impossible.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Driving on Earth is nothing compared to Osram," Lorna said as she handled the controls with ease. "Notice how I put in half the effort you did, but the rover feels lighter," she got up, switching with Xin again. "Now, do it again."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin's heart thudded as he took the wheel once more. He was determined to prove himself, but the pressure was overwhelming. His hands felt heavy, and when the Rover skidded wildly to the side, Lorna snapped.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Do you even understand what the fuck you're doing?" she said coldly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The words hit Xin hard. It wasn't just about driving anymore — this felt personal. Humiliated and angry at himself, he fought the urge to snap back.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "This isn't your civilian Fusion Car, Xin," Lorna continued icily.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Despite the sting of her words, Xin took a deep breath and found his voice.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Tell me how to fix it," he said steadily. Surprise flickered in her blue eyes.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna's anger seemed to fade as they switched seats again. Xin found himself looking at the scar on her cheek a moment too long.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Her hands moved with practiced skill. The Rover responded immediately to her touch. "You're gripping the wheel too tight," she noted. "It's not about forcing it. Feel it — let the machine guide you. You fight the Rover, and you'll lose."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I see," Xin watched as the Rover seemed to glide under her control.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Try steering this thing when the ground's breaking apart under you. Venus quakes, massive fissures opening beneath us — and I was still driving at 60 clicks. You don't win that fight by muscling through. You win by feeling the feedback." As they switched seats again, she said, "Alright. Do it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   When Xin took control again, his heart raced, but he kept Lorna's advice in mind. He loosened his grip and tried to sense the weight of the Rover. The vehicle responded more smoothly, the wheels crunching over the cracked pavement without lurching.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Now, ease into the turns — don't fight them," Lorna said, her tone softer but still commanding. "In low-gravity environments, it's even more important."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin's hands trembled slightly, but he refused to show it. Instead, he let his movements become more intuitive and fluid.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As the Rover glided through the empty landscape, he felt the gap between them narrowing.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Good," Lorna said, sounding satisfied. "This thing's built to handle rough terrain. Trust the suspension system; it'll do the work for you."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin smiled as he drove with new confidence. The cold morning stretched over the old highway as they continued.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Suddenly, the Rover's sensors flashed red. Lorna checked the readings, her voice even. "Helionite dumps ahead. Just another day in the Midwest wilderness."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin tensed at the mention of the cold fusion byproduct. Helionite was harmless to humans but attracted Radi-Mons like moths to a flame. In the distance, they saw stacks of yellow steel barrels.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Is this common out here? Unorganized Helionite dumps?" Xin asked, trying to sound calm.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Most of these were dumped by lazy Mega Corps who don't want to pay for their own nuclear waste storage," Lorna said bitterly. "But since those fat cats are also financial backers of the Alliance Armed Forces, no one cares. It sucks to be a local resident."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Ahead, they spotted more barrels crawling with giant ant-like creatures, each the size of a hoverbike, tearing apart leaking barrels with their mouths and limbs.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Maurs. You don't see them often because they're mindless collectors for the Fenris Horde. Usually too busy harvesting Helionite or Zephyrium to bother humans," Lorna said as she activated the Gauss Machine Gun.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Maurs had opened dozens of Helionite containers, their saliva breaking down industrial-grade seals. Behind them lay a partially exposed Zephyrium processor, occasionally flickering with power.
  </span>
 </p>

  <br/>
 </span>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna seemed calm, but Xin noticed how she touched the scar on her cheek whenever they passed radiation clusters. The Rover's fusion core hummed in response, its shielding adjusting to the chaotic readings.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "In the Imperium, we'd let our fusion waste flow through those fancy green columns to show power," Xin said. "But this..." He gestured at the leaking barrels.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Welcome to the Terra Alliance, where corporate profits matter more than — everything," Lorna replied grimly. She stopped as the sensors warned them. The Maurs had stopped feeding and turned toward the Rover, their bodies crackling with stolen energy. "But since we're SIMU, we'll exterminate these pests just the same."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna activated the Gauss Machine Gun with precise movements. The weapon hummed to life, glowing faintly blue across the control panel.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Wait for it," she said calmly. The first shot cracked through the morning air.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The gun fired in a precise burst, tearing through the closest Maurs. Xin watched as the creatures shattered, their exoskeletons splitting apart and spraying black ichor everywhere.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna remained calm, almost serene as she fired. She reminded Xin of a valkyrie, beautiful and deadly, her blue eyes cold and calculating with every shot. The morning light caught in her blonde hair while the scar on her cheek seemed to highlight her strength.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Another burst of shots rang out, blue light flashing across the highway as more Maurs fell. Xin's heart raced with the rhythm of the gun.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The last Maur fell with a crunch, twitching before going still. The silence that followed was broken only by the hum of the gun powering down.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna sat back, her hand on the console, fingers still over the weapon's control. Her expression softened slightly. "I usually handle the shooting while guys do the driving," she said. "You'll see what I can do when we meet monsters that fight back."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As if on cue, the sensors detected incoming Radi-Mons, sirens blaring in the rover. A pack of Skuggrs chased after them, their brown exoskeletons glistening.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Drive, don't stop!" Lorna commanded.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "As you wish!" Xin gripped the wheel tighter as he focused on navigating through the chaos.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Skuggrs are clever fuckers. They know there are humans inside vehicles like ours," Lorna said as she targeted the approaching monsters and fired. Gunfire mixed with the sizzle of acidic bile hitting the Rover's side. "But today, we're hunters and they're prey."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Panic threatened to overwhelm Xin, but Lorna's confidence kept him focused. He pushed the Rover harder on the straight road, trying to ignore the acid eating at the chassis. "Let's kick this hunt into overdrive, then."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Keep at this speed. I'll cover us," Lorna said firmly as she controlled the gun. More shots rang out as two Skuggrs exploded into piles of flesh and bile.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I'm on it," Xin said, fighting his fear. He needed to stay calm for both their sakes.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Then a pack of mutated hounds appeared around them, at least a dozen. They growled as they tried to surround the Rover.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Bone Fiends are almost on us!" Lorna called out as she fired another volley. The shots tore through the first few Bone Fiends, but others evaded her fire, clinging to the Rover's side and trying to tear it apart.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin's heart raced, but an idea came to him. His hands tightened on the wheel as he calculated his next move.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Without warning, Xin turned the Rover sharply, veering off the road at an angle. The force jolted through the frame as the tires screeched against the asphalt.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   For a second, it felt like they might tip over. But Xin held steady, trusting what Lorna had taught him. The Bone Fiends lost their grip.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The sudden turn threw the creatures off the Rover's side, sending them flying into the concrete barriers with bone-crushing force.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna's eyes widened in surprise. But as the last Bone Fiend was thrown clear, she smiled approvingly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Not bad. Now it's my turn!" she said as she fired another burst from the gun. The rapid fire kept the remaining Bone Fiends from regrouping as Xin guided the Rover back onto the highway.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He took a deep breath, the mixture of Lorna's perfume and sweat only making him more determined.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Suddenly, four Skuggrs emerged from the sides, launching acid attacks with increasing precision. A shot melted part of the rear plating, filling the cabin with the smell of burning metal. The Rover was taking serious damage.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Damn it," Lorna muttered, focusing as she fired controlled bursts. She was methodical, picking off the Skuggrs one by one, but they were outnumbered. The Rover swerved hard to avoid another acid stream. Despite the chaos, Xin found Lorna's confidence calming.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Need to clear a path, Lorna," Xin said steadily despite his racing heart. "I'm going to punch it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna glanced at him, meeting his eyes briefly before nodding. She adjusted her aim toward the Bone Fiends blocking their escape.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Go!" she said simply, and Xin didn't hesitate.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He slammed the accelerator, pushing the Rover to its limit. The vehicle surged forward through the Bone Fiend pack. Lorna's gunfire cleared their path as they broke free of the ambush. The Skuggrs retreated, their acid still sizzling in the distance.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "We did it," Xin exhaled, finally relaxing as the threat passed. His hands were still shaking, but they had survived.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Good job," Lorna said, powering down the gun. Her face was expressionless, but her eyes showed warmth. "You did good, Xin."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Their moment was interrupted by an alarm from the sensors. A massive bio-signature appeared, moving impossibly fast. Through the cracked windshield, Xin saw something that froze his blood - a monster emerging from the trees, three times larger than the regular Bone Fiends. Its dark body had pulsing tubes connecting from its mouth to its spine, throbbing with each step.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Fuck," Lorna said with an edge in her voice. "Mao Dakai."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The creature's presence made the air feel heavy. More Bone Fiends appeared behind it, but they were nothing compared to their master. Dakai's massive jaws opened, revealing rows of teeth dripping with fresh gore.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Drive. Now." Lorna's command was sharp as she turned the gun around. "That bastard's taken down entire SIMU squads. Rachel, Sarah, Monica - he didn't just kill them. He..." Her voice cracked before hardening. "He turned them. The ones he doesn't eat, he breeds. And the gun won't stop him."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin hit the accelerator, but Dakai kept pace with terrifying ease.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The regular Bone Fiends fell behind, unable to match their alpha's speed.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Who's in that Space Rover, now? Sarah's sister? Monica's long lost cousin?" The massive Radi-Mon's footsteps shook the ground as it chased them, moving with surprising agility.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Shut the fuck up, you dritt!" Lorna opened fire, the rounds tearing into Dakai's flesh. Where such hits had destroyed the other Radi-Mons, they only irritated the monster. Dark ichor sprayed from the wounds, but Dakai barely slowed, regenerating almost instantly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "He's not stopping," Xin said tensely as he wrestled with the controls. The wounds on Dakai closed themselves, leaving only dark stains across his form.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Kneecap the fucker!" Lorna shouted, adjusting her aim. A burst of concentrated fire hit Dakai's leg joint, finally drawing a roar of pain. The monster stumbled for just a moment - but that was all they needed.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin seized the chance, yanking the wheel hard. The Rover screamed as he pushed it into a tight turn that should have flipped it. They shot down a narrow side road, buying precious seconds as Dakai's size slowed him down.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "He won't give up," Lorna said grimly, keeping the gun aimed behind them. "I've seen him chase prey for days. He's...as persistent as those creeps in subways. Enjoys the hunt. Likes to wear them down until-" She stopped herself, but Xin heard the personal edge in her voice.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The beast's roar echoed behind them, a sound of frustrated hunger and promise.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Through the rear camera, Xin saw Dakai regaining speed, his powerful legs carrying his massive frame with terrible purpose. The tubes along his body pulsed faster. "I can smell you through the chassis, little younglings! One man in his thirties, and one woman nearing the end of her — twenties, is it?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The old quarry!" Lorna pointed ahead. "The rocks will slow him down. He's too big to maneuver well there."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin nodded and guided the Rover off-road, the suspension groaning on the rough terrain. His earlier lessons proved vital now - every bump could mean the difference between escape and death.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Behind them, Dakai's frustrated roars grew distant as they threaded through the narrow paths between the quarry's rocks. The massive Radi-Mon had to slow down, his size preventing him from following their exact route.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   When they finally emerged on the other side, Dakai was just a dark shape in the distance, his cry promising future encounters. Xin's hands shook on the wheel as the reality of their escape hit him.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "We got lucky," Lorna said quietly, still watching the rear view. "He'll remember us now. Remember you." She turned to him, deadly serious. "Next time we meet him, it won't be about escape."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The damaged Rover held together, the smell of burnt metal and melted plastic filling the air.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A rare, soft smile appeared on Lorna's lips. "Up for more? Pistol training, touring the brig, all that."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The challenge hung between them, her eyes daring him to accept.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin's heart swelled with new confidence, and he grinned back. "Bring it on," he replied steadily.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna's blue eyes sparkled with something like pride, and Xin felt a warmth inside that he hadn't known he needed.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As the sun rose higher, Lorna leaned back with a half-smile. "Drive us back to Evanston HQ and have the Space Rover repaired. We'll grab a quick bite along the way."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Roger that!" Xin guided the damaged vehicle smoothly through the barren landscape.
  </span>
 </p>
