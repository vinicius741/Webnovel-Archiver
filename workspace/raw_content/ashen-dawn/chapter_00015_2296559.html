<p class="cnM5NTc0YWJkNWRkZTQ2ZDU4NDk4MTRkODFjMzc1NmI5"><span style="font-weight: 400">The streets of Etienne buzzed with mid-morning activity despite the drizzle, merchants hawking their wares while townspeople haggled over prices with practiced indifference. Unlike Asapaco's r</span>egimented districts, Etienne sprawled organically, its buildings a hodgepodge of architectural styles cobbled together from whatever materials had been available after the Apocalypse. Vines heavy with purple-green fruit crawled up walls and across rooftops, giving parts of the town the appearance of being slowly reclaimed by the wasteland.</p>
<p class="cnNhZTRjODJhOTRiOTRjZDhiNDU2OTk1ZjIyZjAwZDgz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo's stomach rolled uncomfortably at the sight of the fruit. During his first visit to a region like this, he'd made the rookie mistake of plucking one straight from the vine and biting into it. The vivid hallucinations and violent stomach cramps that followed had taught him a valuable lesson; cooking neutralized the toxins, but raw consumption was a one-way ticket to a very unpleasant day. Commander had laughed for hours.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YTBmNjNlODAxNzRkNzNiNDkwZWIzOWNjMWI4MDg0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaelan walked slightly ahead, her silver hair catching the light in a way that drew curious glances from passersby. Vertigo had suggested she change its color to something less conspicuous, but she'd dismissed the idea with her typical disdain. At least she'd traded her hunting leathers for more nondescript traveling clothes, though she still moved with the unmistakable grace of a predator.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMDhmNTRmZjc2ZDQ0NGY4NTJmMDIwOGFmZjRhMzUx"><span style="font-weight: 400">A group of children darted past, singing in high, clear voices that cut through the market's din:</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMDJlOWM0ODU0YzQ3MDM5MzZmMjVmZDYxY2E0OWM4"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">"The Wingman flies when children cry, to take away their tears.</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">His feathers bright against the night banish all their fears.</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">But don't you call when shadows fall for his shadow-brother too.</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/></span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">One brings light in darkest night, one takes light from you."</span></em></p>
<p class="cnM4ZGI2ODE4OWQwYzQ0NjFhNDI1ZmE3Mzk5NjYyMDU0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaelan froze mid-step, her body suddenly rigid, eyes narrowing as she watched the children disappear into the crowd.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YjA3YzEzNmY3YzQ2OGJhODZlYTc3ZTFiZjc4OTcw"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Just a nursery rhyme," Vertigo said, noticing her reaction. "Kids have been singing it for as long as I can remember."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMmM1NzEyYjMzMzRiOTY4MDIwZTZkYzJkNDM1MjNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">"It's not just a rhyme," Kaelan replied, her voice tight. "It's about angels and demons. Hidden in plain sight."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MDk1MzIwNDA2MDQxMDdiNTRkYWZjNGI3NDJjMDFm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo raised an eyebrow. "What, seriously? No one thinks-"</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTllZTkzZjkxYTQ4MDI5Y2FlZTA0NWVmNTM2YmEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">He caught himself mid-sentence as Kaelan's posture shifted subtly, her attention suddenly laser-focused on something across the marketplace. "There," Kaelan hissed, her voice low and intense. Vertigo followed her gaze to where a small green-cloaked figure was staring back at them from beside a fruit vendor's stall.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MzRjODBmNzcwMjRlMGZhMTExNmFhMDdkNzcxODhk"><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment their eyes met, the cloaked figure turned and began moving through the crowd with deliberate purpose - not running, which would draw attention, but walking swiftly with the practiced ease of someone who knew exactly how to disappear in plain sight.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOTYwZWQ3MGEyNDRjNjJhNmNjZjQyZTBhYTBiODMy"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Follow," Kaelan commanded, already in motion. "That’s the angel."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YmZiZGI3MzdkZTQ5ZjJiOGE4YTg1YTI1ZGU2MDI0"><span style="font-weight: 400">And so began one of the strangest chases Vertigo had ever experienced in his life. Unlike the pursuits he was accustomed to, this one was conducted at a brisk walk, weaving through bodies, maintaining the appearance of normal shoppers while keeping the green cloak in sight. The target moved with uncanny precision, slipping through gaps in the crowd that seemed to open just for her, never breaking into a run but somehow maintaining distance.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMjJiZGJkYzY4OTQwODRiNjg1M2YyZTBmYzM3OWU2"><span style="font-weight: 400">"We're losing her," Vertigo muttered as their quarry rounded a corner into a less populated street.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NjJlMTZiODFiNzQ2NGU5NTYzYzY5MWU1NWU4NmM5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaelan's eyes scanned the layout of buildings ahead. "Split up. You circle around through that alley and cut her off. I'll keep following directly." She didn't wait for his acknowledgment before peeling off to maintain the pursuit.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNWNhYTYyZjNjNDQ3YjJhZmJmYWUzZTIzYTJmMTE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo ducked into the narrow passage between buildings, the sudden dimness momentarily disorienting after the bright marketplace. The alley stank of rotting fruit and worse things, but he ignored it, focused on the task. He calculated the stranger's trajectory and increased his pace to a jog.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNjE3NWMwOTM1MTQxMTJiN2YxNDVkYzc0MDBkNzQ1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Emerging from the alley's mouth, he spotted the green cloak just ahead, moving toward him unaware of the trap. With a burst of speed, he closed the gap and clamped a hand on the figure's arm. "Hold up there."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MmM3NmM4NGU1MDQwZThhMjJmNWQ0MTI4NWEyZjg0"><span style="font-weight: 400">The stranger froze, hood falling back to reveal a young woman with a heart-shaped face and striking, deep indigo eyes that widened in alarm as they met his. She couldn't have been more than twenty by appearance, with chestnut hair cropped raggedly to her chin, shorter in the back. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwNTdjMDU1MjEwNDRlYWY5ZGRkOTAwZWJiMzQ1OWRk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaelan approached from behind, breathing easily despite the chase. As her footsteps sounded on the cobblestones, the captive angel's eyes flicked toward her, then back to Vertigo, calculation replacing fear.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDQzYzMzYzg3NDRhYWVhOGQ1MjA5ODA1NDQwM2Q5"><span style="font-weight: 400">"I wouldn't-" he started to say, but it was too late.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYmRiZjllMDA3ODRlZTA5ZjQ4ZjM1N2FiNzlmMDUz"><span style="font-weight: 400">The solid form beneath his hand suddenly dissolved, becoming nothing more than a fine mist that slipped through his fingers like smoke. The cloaked angel was gone, leaving only a wisp of vapor that began to drift rapidly down the empty adjacent alley.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NmVlYmE2NjI3ODRjZDE4ODE5ZTAyYjEzNGJhN2Ix"><span style="font-weight: 400">"No you don't," Kaelan growled, reaching out a hand and making a fist, jerking it in a yanking motion back toward herself as though grabbing an invisible rope. The air crackled with energy, and a soft, pained yelp echoed through the alley.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOTNhZTNjNWEzYjQyZTU5MDY3NWEyNzYzMTA4Zjg3"><span style="font-weight: 400">The mist wavered, coalesced, and suddenly the angel was whole again, stumbling forward as her body forcibly re-solidified. She nearly lost her footing, catching herself against the wall with one hand.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYzU1MmE0OTc5NzQ5MDY4ZTgyOTE5MmE4NTIwYjdl"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Please," she said, voice surprisingly flat and monotone despite her situation. "I don't want to fight." She raised her hands, backing away slightly. "You have what you wanted, just... just leave me alone."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDBkZDY4YTFmMTQzZGU5YzM3YTY2ZDkwYThmYzBk"><span style="font-weight: 400">"What are you talking about?" Kaelan stepped forward, her stance ready for any trick. The other angel stared at her for a moment, confusion flickering across her features before her eyes widened in recognition.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYmZmMjA5NDJkMTQ0MjJiNTFjYzEwY2UwZGYzMDkz"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Wait... I know you!" Something like awe crept into her voice. "You're Kaelan." Her gaze shifted to Vertigo, and the reverence fell away, replaced with wariness. "And... why are you with a half-breed?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMzcyNjliOTkxMzQ1NGQ4NjFiYzU4YWMzYmNhNjgy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaelan's expression remained neutral. "I'm sorry, I don't-"</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YmY2NTc5ODU5NjRkZTM5ZTY5ZjFjOGI1MDk3ZjRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Of course you wouldn't remember me." The smaller angel shook her head, a bitter smile touching her lips. "I'm Argent. Angel of Storms," she clarified as Kaelan raised an eyebrow. "I thought you were with Kaldi."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzY2YxMGQwMDA2YTQ2Yzc5N2RlY2JkYWM4OWQxOTEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">"I thought </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">you</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> might be with Kaldi," Kaelan responded, tension easing slightly from her posture. "What did you mean before when you said I had what I wanted?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZGM0ZWRiM2Q0MjQ3NTNhZjVmNTlmNzdmNzU1YTI0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Argent glanced around the alley, her eyes traveling upward to scan rooftops and windows as though expecting observers. "Not... not here." Her voice dropped lower. "Come with me. I have a room." She hesitated, then added with quiet urgency, "If you don't know what's happening... we really need to talk."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNDYxYjc0MWZmNzQ5OWM5YmUyNGFjMDM0M2IwMDM2" style="text-align: center"> </p>
<hr/>
<p class="cnNmNzEyYTAxZTUyYTRlM2RiZWIzMGUzOGNhYjEwM2Yy" style="text-align: center"> </p>
<p class="cnNlZWJiMTYyZjMwMDQwZTViM2FiYTk4MmQwN2Q2ODdm"><span style="font-weight: 400">The inn room was small and sparsely furnished; a single bed, a rickety table, and two mismatched chairs. A threadbare curtain covered the window, diffusing the midday light into a soft glow that did little to brighten the somber atmosphere. Argent moved to the window first, peering through a gap in the fabric before drawing the curtain fully closed.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzY0MWRiNjc2YTQ2YWNiMTMxOWFmZjc1N2E0ZDhm"><span style="font-weight: 400">"No one followed us," Kaelan stated, taking a position with her back to the wall. It wasn't a question.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMjBkM2EyNzg5YjQxZmE4ZDc4ZTc4YzVlNGU2OTVk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Argent nodded once, touching something that hung around her neck beneath her shirt, then sank onto the edge of the bed, her shoulders slumping with sudden exhaustion. The fearful, hunted look in her eyes made her seem even younger.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMzQ2YTllYjBiYTQ1ZGViYjI2OGM5MDVmZjI3OGFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Talk," Kaelan said, her tone softening slightly despite the command.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NGE3YTgwNDNlYTRjMmQ4ZDY4MTNjMDM0ZmM5ZTcw"><span style="font-weight: 400">"She started with the weakest of us." Argent's voice remained flat as she stared unseeing at her bare, dirt-smudged feet. "The novices, and the younger Tier 1 angels, and the ones who resent the mortals."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMmIxNDFmZDA0ZTRjMmQ4OWRmMWIxMjQxYjVkYWQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400">"I know she's been trying to convince a lot of us-"</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YzY1ZGQwYTg3NzQ2MGViNmRmNzJmNTIxY2JhNGQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400">"You don't </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">know</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">." Argent's voice sharpened, her indigo eyes suddenly intense as they locked with Kaelan's. Vertigo, standing forgotten in the corner, felt his skin prickle at the raw emotion in her stare. "Or if you did, and didn't try to stop her, you're worse than she is."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZWJiOGMxMGMwMjQ0MDI5MTI2OTQwYjE4NmZhZGY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaelan was silent for a long moment, her expression unreadable. Then, biting her lip- "It's bad, isn't it." It wasn't a question.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzM2NmY2JkNjU3MzRiMzhiMWY4NGE5YWI1Yzc0YWM0"><span style="font-weight: 400">A small, tight nod.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTY1MGQ3M2ExODQ5OTliNTA1MTNlZDcyYzlmNDRm"><span style="font-weight: 400">"How bad?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMzA4MWIxM2QyMTQ2YjlhMzI5N2VhNjJlZWZhNjlk"><span style="font-weight: 400">"If you listen to her, not much. You just have to fall in line behind her. If you don't..." Argent shrugged one shoulder, the gesture somehow more disturbing in its casualness than any display of emotion would have been. "You get the one-on-one talks. And the arguments. And the threats. And eventually..." A shiver wracked her small frame.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0Yzg0NWNjZDlhOTRmMDg5MDhlMTUzMWRiYzI0ODFm"><span style="font-weight: 400">"She's torturing you, isn't she?" Kaelan asked, her voice gentle in a way Vertigo had never heard before.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOTA2ODEwOTcyYTQxMDM4MzdkYjVjMDUzNDU5YTQ0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Argent nodded stiffly, her gaze dropping back to the floor. "Bits of essence... taken by force."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMGIxMzlmNWRmMTQ1MjQ4M2M3OTRmMTk1MGE4ZWFk"><span style="font-weight: 400">The temperature in the room seemed to plummet as Kaelan went utterly still. Then, like a thunderstorm breaking, fury erupted around her, crackling to life in visible arcs of static electricity. Her hair lifted with the force of the energy field surrounding her, individual strands moving with a life of their own.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYWY2ZmM3ZDc5ZTQ2ZDNiMDM0ZTRiYjZmOWM0ODRl"><span style="font-weight: 400">"I </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">knew</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> it!" she snarled, surging to her feet. "I was afraid of that after I ran into Jaeli." The sparks dancing around her fingers cast eerie shadows across her face. "How the hell is everyone not ganging up against her? Why isn't she being stopped?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYzJlZjliZmNiZjRlNmQ5NzI5MGVlZDg3YWZkNzk2"><span style="font-weight: 400">If Vertigo had thought he'd seen her angry when they first met, he quickly realized that had been mere irritation. This - this was true, righteous fury, terrible in its intensity. A mixture of awe and unease prickled across his skin.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OWY1YWQ0ZjRjMTQyZTQ4ZjI3ODhkMjk2MmRkMzBl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Argent seemed unmoved by the display. "Nobody knows, really," she said, voice still monotone despite the tension crackling through the room. "She keeps her followers separated from everyone else, and anyone she decides to try to 'persuade' just disappears." Nervously, she looked up to meet Kaelan's electric gaze. "I slipped out from under their watch and came here. It was easier than staying there, after... after. You met Jaeli? I think they might be looking for me."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNmRiMzVjNDkyZTRkZjI4OGVhMmM4ODc0MmUwY2Nl"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Tell me everything you know," Kaelan ordered, the electrical discharge around her intensifying. "And then we're going to go and tell everyone."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNTEwNTgyZTk0YTRlOTA4YjA3YjViODc1ZGE0ZWI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">"I can't," Argent protested, the first real fear showing in her eyes since they'd entered the room. "I've been trying to lay low so they won't find me. If I go home I'm dead, and..." She shuddered visibly. "I can't go back there."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MzQ2ZTk5MWY0ODRiODE4Y2QzNmRmMjY1OTg0ZWI3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaelan put a hand on her shoulder; the younger angel shrank back slightly, though whether from the contact or the residual electrical charge, Vertigo couldn't tell. The fire in Kaelan's eyes made him feel suddenly like an intruder, forgotten and unnecessary in this conflict between immortal beings.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMmQ5OGEzODk5ODQ2MGM5ZGY2YjQ2MTQ5Mzk5Mzg5"><span style="font-weight: 400">"We'll protect you."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZjkxZjc3ZmYxNDQ3YmJhYzU1NjhmYmNhZDlhMDJl"><span style="font-weight: 400">The words left his mouth before he'd consciously decided to speak. Both angels turned to look at him, identical expressions of surprise on their faces, as though they'd forgotten his presence entirely.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyM2ZkYzdmMGZjNTRhYzViNjEyZWRjNWFhOWNhMTU1"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Look," he continued, crossing his arms over his chest, "I'm not really sure what's going on, but I'm sure as shit not going to let the bad guys just have you."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZDQ2MGRkYWNiNTRjZjRiNjBjYzFiOWFhMjY0YTM2"><span style="font-weight: 400">The two women exchanged a look that contained volumes of unspoken communication. Argent spoke first, her voice carrying a hint of disbelief. "Why is there a half-breed?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNDhiYmE0MDM5MTQ4NGRhNWU5MjJhY2UyODViMTky"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaelan sighed, the electrical discharge around her subsiding as she regained control. "It's complicated." She looked annoyed, but at least her body language opened to include him in the conversation. "He's part of a deal I made to get help to take down Kaldi."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Y2JkZWFkY2U0MzQyODhiNmUwMDhlN2M5YTc3ODEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">"I'm not really sure where Commander fits into your entire angel war thing," Vertigo said, a defensive edge creeping into his voice, "but if he's on your side, so am I. Miss High-and-Mighty over there might not think I'm worth much against one of you guys, but I said I'll protect you and I will."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYTUwNjhlZmViNzRmZjNhMGE5NzU1OTgzNjE3YzIy"><span style="font-weight: 400">"You can't protect me on the angelic realm." Argent's eyes were oddly calm as she looked at him, their indigo depths still and endless as a midnight sky. "You can't go there. They'd kill you."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNzc4MzE3OWEzNzQ3ZDZiMDUzMDgzMjQzYzAxYjVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Angelic... realm?" Vertigo raised an eyebrow, looking between the two women. Argent cast a questioning look at Kaelan, who rolled her eyes in exasperation.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NzA4N2YzYjU4ODQ2N2ZiOWZkN2E5ZjRiNzhkN2Q4"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Look, it's temporary, alright?" Kaelan snapped. "I didn't see the need to tell him </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">everything</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">." She huffed a sigh, running a hand through her silver hair, which still retained some of its unnatural lift from the electrical discharge. "I'm going to contact Chidara. She needs to know what you've told me, at the very least. I won't reveal your identity, but everyone has to know what's happening."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MzMyMGI5M2I2ZTQ0YmFhOGQxYTUzZmRkYTZhMmJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">She stared calculatingly at Argent for a moment, then made a decision. "We've got a place safer than this. We'll go back there for now and figure out what to do from there." With a final, crackling spark of energy, she swept toward the door, yanking it open without a backward glance. Argent rose silently from the bed to follow.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNzJkMTRjNDg4MjQyNzdhYTE1NzEyNjNmZDZiZmRl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo snorted under his breath. "What, she says jump, you say how high?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMzODBiMDIzOTA2NTQ4NzNhZjBlYzNmYTkwNGRiNmQx"><span style="font-weight: 400">The smaller angel paused, turning to study him with those unsettling indigo eyes. "Kaelan's much older than I am, and much better at this," she said simply. "She's..." A faint color touched her cheeks. "She's kind of a legendary hunter. A lot of us look up to her, but she's hard to get close to. I never really thought I'd get to speak to her."</span></p><span class="cmVkMTEyYWViYzJkMzRmNWJhOGJhNjk2M2E3NmNkYTk4"><br/>You could be reading stolen content. Head to Royal Road for the genuine story.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM4MGQ4ZmFhZDY0ODQ0NmZhMGM5NmRjNmYzMzUwMTA1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo stared, momentarily at a loss for words. "What... seriously?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNTJlYzI0OTdhZTRhZDA5NjU1OGEyOTZiMGMyZjkz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Argent just tilted her head toward the doorway where Kaelan had disappeared. "Come on," she said. "She won't wait up for long."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZDcyNWUyMWIzZjRkZWE4ZjUzZWI1NmNmODc2NGRj"> </p>
<hr/>
<p class="cnNhYzVhNmMyMWYxYzRmZDc4ZDliNjA5NjE5MDQ1Zjcx"> </p>
<p class="cnM5ZDk5ZmM4ZDgzNjQ1ZGQ5MzIxNDFjNzgxNDhmYzU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">The abandoned building they'd claimed as a temporary base was more stable than it looked from the outside, though water leaked through the ceiling in several places. The afternoon rain had stayed steady and relentless, turning the dusty floor into patches of mud where the roof had partially collapsed.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Zjg1ODFlZGJkYTQ0ZTRiOWRkYmY2YmExMTY3ZjAx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo sat in a corner on the only remaining dry patch of floor, one leg stretched out in front of him, watching Kaelan with undisguised curiosity. She was seated in the center of the room, legs crossed beneath her, utterly motionless with her eyes closed. Rain dripped through cracks in the ceiling, occasionally spattering against her, but she gave no indication of noticing.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNWIwYWI0YTJhZTRmMjVhNjlmMzllZTcxZWQwMmUx"><span style="font-weight: 400">"She okay?" he asked Argent, who was sitting curled up against the opposite wall, arms wrapped around her knees. He tilted his head toward Kaelan's still form. "She hasn't even twitched in, like, an hour." Her hair had begun to darken from silver to gunmetal grey in the damp. He wondered absently how wet she'd let herself get before moving.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YmEyY2U0Y2M2ZDRjMzI5MjA5NTA2MzhhNDVkOGNk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Argent didn't need to look over at Kaelan to respond. "She's speaking with Chidara. She's fine."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMGEwY2QwNDY4MTQ4NWI5ZWRkODYzYzNmMjFkMTgz"><span style="font-weight: 400">"So, what," Vertigo started, just to break the uncomfortable silence, "is this Chidara, like, your leader, or...?" He tried to imagine an angelic version of Commander and failed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOWQ2N2YyZTYwZDQ1MDU4NWExZDM1ZWRhODBjNGU5"><span style="font-weight: 400">"No." Argent shook her head emphatically. "We're all unified by Weaver's will, not the whims of a leader. Ideas are discussed and implemented based on merit, and on advice from the older angels." She hesitated, considering her words. "Chidara is... nobody really knows, but she might actually be the oldest angel in existence." She glanced over at Kaelan's still form, something like reverence in her eyes. "She's Kaelan's friend. Rumor has it she's the only one."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYzFkZWIwOGMxNzQzMzdhOWI3MzEyOTgzMzEwMGUy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo snorted, unable to contain his amusement. "That really doesn't surprise me."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNDVjYjA4ZDZiYjRmNTM4YTRkODQ3MWNjZDQzNzdl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Argent shot him a wounded look on Kaelan's behalf. "She's not really... warm, and she doesn't work with anyone else... well, not anymore... but she's one of the best hunters we have." Her voice took on a hint of defensiveness. "She's got an amazing kill count."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YTc3NTM2Mzc1MTQwZmFiMDY4YWFmYWRjN2VjNzU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">She said it with the same flat affect she might use to comment on the weather, as though the systematic slaughter of demons was simply a normal topic of conversation. Vertigo felt something uncomfortable twist in his gut, a reminder of just what these beings were, beneath their human-like exteriors. "What do you mean, not anymore?" he questioned, curiosity overcoming his unease. "Her hunting buddies kick her out of the group or something?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMwODQ3NjdhOTk0NjQ0MGRiMDgxN2IzZTFmNmRkNWUw"><span style="font-weight: 400">"No..." Argent's gaze dropped, a flicker of discomfort crossing her features. "I don't really know the story, so I can't tell you anything about it. It's not my story to tell, anyway... I shouldn't have said anything." She traced a pattern in the dust with one finger. "I just heard that she used to have a partner. Before I crossed over."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNTM2MzE0OWNmNzRkZjA4MTM3YzE4OGUyN2M2NmMy"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Crossed over... that's what you guys call dying, right?" Vertigo seized on the new thread of information, leaning forward slightly. "Do you actually... remember dying? Are you still dead?" The questions tumbled out before he could consider their sensitivity. He realized with a start that he didn't even know if Kaelan had a heartbeat. The thought bothered him more than it should, and he glanced away.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYjE3YjNhYmE5OTRmZjlhYjZiNDM3NTFiYjMwNzZh"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Crossing over isn't dying," Argent informed him, her tone taking on a pedantic edge that reminded him unnervingly of Kaelan. "Mortals die every day. Only the special ones chosen by the Goddess cross over and become </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">angelus</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">." Her voice caressed the Celestial word with the same accent Kaelan used. "And yes... we remember dying." Her indigo eyes bored into him, unblinking. "It wasn't pleasant."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxM2ZmZDJkNmJlNjRiYmViZTNiMmUwYTBlNDdjYzgy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo recognized the warning in her tone but persisted, driven by a hunger for understanding he couldn't quite explain. "Is that what makes you all..." He waved his hands vaguely. "I mean, look at her, and we saw this blue-haired chick, and... that's just not normal."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NjBlMzgzNjg5NDQxY2M5MTZkNjAzMjAwY2E0Yjhh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Argent sighed, relenting. "Something about the rush of magic during the angelic transformation can alter your appearance. It doesn't always happen. It didn't to me." She nodded toward Kaelan's still form. "It's usually limited to coloring, though. That, and the wings." Her voice faltered slightly on the last word, a tremor he might have missed if he hadn't been listening so intently.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOWM1ZDhhZDA3NjQ4NmFhZWI3ZWUwYjRlMDI1ODFi"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Yeah, so what's up with that, anyway?" he pressed, recalling the brief, terrifying glimpse he'd had of Kaelan's wings during their first encounter. "I thought angels were supposed to have these pure white feathery wings. How come hers are so... different?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMGIyMzczZjQ0ODQ4MzE5ZDA4OTM0ZWRmMDA5MzFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">"You saw them?" Argent's eyes widened with genuine surprise. Before he could ask if that was significant, she continued, "It happens. Most angels do have feathery wings, and they come in all colors. Sometimes you get bat or dragon ones, like a demon's." Her gaze flickered briefly to his back, as though searching for something. "Demons never get feathery wings." She hesitated, then added, "Some think demon wings are a sign that you have a demon's heart, or that you're open to corruption, but I don't believe it." She glanced toward Kaelan. "I don't know anyone who hates demons more than Kaelan does."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZDlkMGEyMzA0YjQ2NTQ5YWY1MjMxNjQwNjljYWI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">"What do yours look like?" Vertigo asked, curiosity overcoming caution. "Can I see them?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZjAxYjkzMGE0YTQ4OWRiZmY5MDhkOGU5ZDM2MmZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Argent jerked back as though he'd physically struck her, fear flashing across her face. "N-no."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MGYxY2NmNjFlNDRiNjY4MTQyNTJkZDU2MTI0MzYy"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Hey, hey, sorry." He raised his hands placatingly. "I didn't mean... Is it not allowed, or something?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YmJmYWI3MjUzNDRiMDQ4ZDBmM2Q4YjhhMDY1OTEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">"No, it's fine, it's just..." She took a deep, shaky breath, her hands trembling slightly where they clutched her knees. "Wh-when Kaldi... I mean, when they had me, they... when they..."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZTFjYzA4ODczMzRjNDBhOTExZTkyMjU1ZTUyZjIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">"They did something to your wings," he finished flatly, as understanding and rage bloomed simultaneously in his chest.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMTFiZGNmZDA5OTRiYjQ5N2JkMjE2YTgyOTlkYmZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Wings are... sensitive..." she whispered, so quietly he had to strain to hear. "They're an excellent means of inflicting pain, Sakurai said."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MTg3NzFkMzJmMDQ0OWU4OWRlNmY2NjFkZDc1ZDcx"><span style="font-weight: 400">A low growl rose unbidden from Vertigo's throat, heat prickling beneath his skin as his anger manifested physically. Argent's eyes widened, and she shrank back against the wall, fear replacing the vulnerability in her expression.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNTRlM2NjNGI4ZTQ0OGJiOWFiYjQ1YmYxNGE2ZGEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">"You're glowing," came Kaelan's voice, suddenly beside him though he hadn't noticed her move. "You're scaring her."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOWEzNTkzMGRjZDQzNDg5ODQxYjJlYjI2OTFlMzkz"><span style="font-weight: 400">"What?" He blinked, disoriented by her sudden appearance.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyODA3NGQ3ZDI3NjRjZGFhODFiOWYwMTc4NDdmODhm"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Your eyes," she snapped, pointing at his face. "Turn it off."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NzgyZDAxODY5MzQ2NTY4YTgyMTE0YzNhZWFiY2Zk"><span style="font-weight: 400">"I-I'm fine," Argent interjected weakly. "You just startled me."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZmFiOWZkOTJlMjRhMmNhOWU4ODYyZjFjMGM3N2I5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaelan shrugged, her silver hair dripping rainwater onto the dusty floor. "I wouldn't expect you to have much experience hanging around half-breeds," she said to Argent. "It's understandable." Vertigo felt a flash of irritation at the casual use of the term he'd come to resent. Kaelan turned on him, her expression hardening. "Get it under control or take it outside," she ordered. "You're not losing it in here."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYjlkMjAwZDIwYjRmYjViMTYzNWIyZjI2ZTIzZGFm"><span style="font-weight: 400">"It's wet out there!" he complained, aware of how childish he sounded even as the words left his mouth.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YzNiNTRhNjllNDQ2YjE5YjI4Y2U5OWExYjMxYjUz"><span style="font-weight: 400">"I don't care." Her voice was ice. "Go be wet, or wait until it's dry to have a tantrum."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZmVhMjRmZjZkNDRkMDlhNWFkMjI4ZDVjNzE0ZmY4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo glared at her, his jaw working wordlessly for a moment. The red glow in his eyes slowly faded, and he deliberately unclenched his fists, taking a deep breath. "Fine," he muttered, deliberately turning away from both of them. He found a corner as far from Argent as possible and sat with his back to the wall, focusing on his breathing the way Commander had taught him years ago.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYTc4OGU5Yjk5MjRlZWY5YmI3ZjY3Mzc3MDdhMjI5"><span style="font-weight: 400">The silence that followed was broken only by the rhythmic patter of raindrops through the leaky ceiling. Kaelan returned to her meditative position, her back impossibly straight, while Argent huddled in her corner, pulling her knees to her chest and resting her chin on them.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjk2MmYyYmQ5OTRhNDM4NGZlMjM2MWQ2MWNhY2E1"><span style="font-weight: 400">No one spoke for nearly an hour. Vertigo used the time to examine what he'd learned, fitting new pieces into the puzzle of their situation. This Kaldi was clearly dangerous, dangerous enough to frighten even Argent, who herself was powerful enough to transform into mist at will. And Kaelan's reaction... he'd never seen her so genuinely enraged. Whatever was happening in the angelic realm, it was serious.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTA0NzU5MDJkNjRjNGY4MWU2ZTg2OWRjNzU1Yjg0"><span style="font-weight: 400">The rain gradually eased, tapering from a steady downpour to a light drizzle. Kaelan, who had remained motionless throughout, finally opened her eyes and rose gracefully to her feet. "We need to move. The contact will be waiting."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MWM1OTFlM2EyZTRkMDBiMjM4OGI4Mjg3ZmU4NWQ2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo stood, shaking the stiffness from his limbs. He hesitated, then addressed Argent directly, keeping his voice low. "For what it's worth, I'm sorry about earlier. I didn't mean to scare you." Argent's indigo eyes widened slightly at the unexpected apology. She gave a small, almost imperceptible nod of acknowledgment before following Kaelan outside.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMWFjMzM0MjFkZTRkMzk5M2Q5OWYxMmJjZmY5NDlm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo exhaled slowly, wondering when exactly his life had become so complicated, and stepped out into the damp afternoon air. He walked in silence, half-listening to the hushed conversation between the two angels. Unlike Kaelan, Argent seemed tolerable, almost sympathetic toward him, but he suspected from his encounter with Jaeli that Kaelan's cold disdain was more representative of her kind.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYzFjYTY1NjhkMzRiZDFhMDQxMjVlMDVlNWY1YjJk"><span style="font-weight: 400">The angels spoke in low tones of events and people he had no context for, making no effort to include him in their conversation. Though he was nominally leading their small group, he felt like an outsider - a feeling that had become all too familiar since Kaelan had entered his life.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYjRjZjkxYTJlNTQ2YTg4ZmQxODhjMThiMjI3MzQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">As they neared the center of town, he watched his companions take in their surroundings with wary eyes. Etienne's buildings were clearly newer than Asapaco's ancient structures, and the difference showed in both their crude engineering and the materials used. Green vines covered many walls in a thick blanket, the purple-green fruit hanging in heavy clusters.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OGM0NmEwOTYwYzQ1ODRhNWIzMWM0ZTE4ZTViNTk5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Even in this relatively small town, Commander's reputation cast a long shadow. Vertigo caught several nervous glances directed their way as they passed. The corps' last visit hadn't been so long ago, and wherever Commander went, memorable events tended to follow. He returned the stares with a narrow-eyed glare that caused most onlookers to quickly look away.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMjg0NzFkODA1YzQ1MzQ5MmU3ZGNmZjg4NTViMzQ0"><span style="font-weight: 400">One man, however, did a double-take, paused, and called out a greeting. Vertigo's teeth clenched at the unwanted attention. He had no memory of the man but continued walking without acknowledgment, and thankfully, the stranger's wave died in confusion.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZDg0MTg2YzM4MTQ5ZTViZDBjZmZjMjdiMmEyOGU0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaelan and Argent had noticed the exchange, and Kaelan shot him a questioning look that was unreadable but clearly demanded explanation. "Welcome to Etienne," Vertigo muttered under his breath. "Where everyone knows your business before you do."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZGQ3M2VjOGM3YjQzNjBhMDRmMmJmMTJmZTZkODNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">The tension in his shoulders began to ease as they reached the town center and melded into the crowded marketplace. Etienne lacked the overwhelming sensory assault of Asapaco; no armored guards, no uniformed sentries, no undercurrent of factional politics simmering beneath every interaction. Just the everyday bustle of people focused more on survival than ambition.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZjEyNTQ4YTUyNDRiMGU5NGRiZGIyZDlmOTYzMmY3"><span style="font-weight: 400">He scanned the market square, eyes moving methodically over the vendors and their wares, searching for anything out of place. "Commander, in all his amazing vagueness, said they should be here somewhere," he explained, frustration coloring his voice. "Shouldn't be hard to spot."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZGE3ODVkNDY5OTQwODFiYWUyZWE2MzNlMWZkNWQ2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaelan placed her hands on her hips, sighing as she flicked her long hair impatiently over her shoulder. "You mean he didn't even bother to give us a description of the contact we’re supposed to meet?" she snapped. "Or, Goddess forbid, even a meeting spot?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOGI1MTRlYmYxZDQzMGI4MWRjZGI5ODNiYWNkNjg1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Behind her, Argent silently surveyed the milling crowd, her indigo eyes wide as she took in the scene. Momentarily distracted, she paused at a merchant's booth displaying fabric scraps. Vertigo nearly lost sight of her before realizing she had stopped. When he turned back, she was already smiling and depositing coins in the merchant's outstretched hand. She quickly ran to catch up, a small, brightly colored scarf clutched in her fingers.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZmRmMzkyZGRlZTQyN2ViNzdkNGEwYzNlZDZlMjYx"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Stay close," Vertigo growled, eyeing the cheaply made garment with disapproval. "What do you need that for, anyway?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNGQ5OTJmYjMxNDQyZDViNmUzMWY1ZTQ0NjBjMWI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Argent shrugged and tucked the scrap of gauze into her cloak without defensiveness. "I don't, but his children looked hungry."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzFiN2FmNGIxMDRjMjc4OWMxNzVjOTFjZTlmNWNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">"That's how they get you," Vertigo informed her, resuming his scan of the market. "You pity everyone who looks like they need a handout, pretty soon you're broker than shit." He turned back to Kaelan, continuing their earlier conversation. "If I can't figure out where the fuck he is, I'm blind." He waited for Kaelan to point out the possibility of a female contact, but she amazingly refrained from the obvious correction. "It's going to be obvious," he added with more confidence than he felt. "That's all I know."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxM2EyYjAzNDg5ZjQwNTdiZjFiN2IzMTJmZTNjZDQy"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was, in fact, nothing of the sort. The minutes stretched as they circled the marketplace, Vertigo's frustration mounting with each pass. It was only when he caught a subtle gesture, repeated deliberately to catch his attention, that he finally spotted their contact.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3OWY0MmVmMjEzMTRkNjliNDk5MDU1YTg1OTliODdl"><span style="font-weight: 400">The tall, wiry man stood at the edge of the market, just slightly better dressed than the average townsperson. His sharp features were not at all marred by the burn scar crossing his right cheek, and his short-cropped salt-and-pepper hair and beard lent him a distinguished air despite his obvious age.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMzkyYTUzMDU5NTRiODliODA0MGI2N2I2ZDc2ZDA4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo's mouth curved into a lopsided smirk as he approached. "For once Commander didn't make me play the damn guessing game," he said, pulling his muffler down and clapping the man familiarly on the shoulder. "Thierry! How the hell've you been?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMzNlYzdiZjE0MTRlYzZhODBhYTI1MTllNGFkOTVm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Thierry's lips pressed into a thin line, his expression guarded. Vertigo's smile faltered. "You don't look too happy to see me."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MzJmOTM3YWIzZTRhNDViYzM4ZTJmNWNlY2VmZTAy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Behind him, Kaelan huffed impatiently but for once allowed him to take the lead without interjecting.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OGJmMDY3MDQ1MjQ5NTdiMWFhY2ViMDY4OTQwNWNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Thierry's gaze flickered over Vertigo's shoulder, eyeing Kaelan and Argent with a piercing stare. Dark eyes burned in his pale face, avid as a raptor's. "I don't recognize these two." His soft, lilting western accent cut through the background chatter, as distinctive as a blade among butter knives. "New recruits, are they?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZDFlN2JkMjljOTQ1MDViOTE4MTY5YjRiZTA1ODg5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo leaned back against the alley wall, crossing his arms over his chest. "They're my associates."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNmI2ODE3Y2NmZjQzMWVhOWNhZDRjMzU5ODk3ZDZk"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Ha." The older man's laugh held no humor. "That's Asapacan talk, that is. Seems like everyone's just come from there." His gaze hardened, something knowing and dangerous lurking behind his eyes. "Including trouble."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhN2YxYjFlMDZkNDQ3Y2VhZjY1NWI2YmI3ZGMwNzc3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Thierry glanced past them toward the bustling marketplace, then jerked his head toward a narrower alley deeper in the shadows. "Not here. Too many ears."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YmVmMjU0Y2Y5MDQ4MTZiNDdlOWJiYmVmYjVmZTI1"><span style="font-weight: 400">They followed him into the cramped passage between two buildings, the sounds of the market fading behind them. When Thierry spoke again, his voice was barely above a whisper. "Yolanda's people arrived three days ago. A small group, moving quiet-like, but word travels." He ran a finger absently along the burn scar on his cheek. "They've been asking questions. About Commander. About you."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YjE1YmY2MDgwZDQ4NzVhYmJiOWZlYWRhYTRkZjEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Fuck," Vertigo muttered. "How much do they know?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMDcxMjgyNDcwMjRjZTg4OWYyNDFkZWI5N2ZhY2Rl"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Enough to be dangerous," Thierry replied grimly. "But they're not just asking. They're setting up shop."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYWY4NzNhNGFjNzQ3NjVhNzkyN2ViYzdjNTkxYTI3"><span style="font-weight: 400">"What are they moving?" Kaelan interjected, her voice cool and precise.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYzYxMmNhZTY1MjRiZTI4OTA3M2I1NTg1ZTY3ZmFm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Thierry's gaze flickered to her, reassessing. "You're quick. That's the real problem." He sighed heavily. "Medical supplies. Stolen from half a dozen settlements west of here. People are dying without that medicine."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MWUwYTIxOWNlMjQ4ZDY5OGIyNmYyMWM0NTc5ODBk"><span style="font-weight: 400">"The supplies are just a cover," Argent said softly, her voice startling in the tense atmosphere. "For something worse."</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNTAzOGY3Njc4MTQzNzg5MjVmOTA1OTQ2MGU2OTYx"><span style="font-weight: 400">The old man's eyes widened slightly at her insight. "Smart girl. Yes. Word is they've got people too. Special ones."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTg3NjI2NDcwNDQ2NDdiMDQyZWY1ZTg0M2NkNWZm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo's jaw tightened. "Talents."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYjhjYzA5ODFkNDQ1ZmM5NWQ5MWI2Yjk4MGI1ZDMx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Thierry nodded. "Young ones mostly. Untrained. Snatched from villages that can't protect themselves." He pulled a small, folded scrap of paper from his jacket and pressed it into Vertigo's hand. "Last known location of the supplies and their... other cargo."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NmFlZTc2MjBkNTQ3NDY4Yjc4ZWU4ZTk5NWU0MTNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo unfolded the paper, revealing a crudely drawn map with a building marked near the river district. "You sure about this?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZDgxN2MwNjhiZDRlYjE4ZDQ2OThiNjlmM2IyMjAz"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Sure as sunrise," Thierry confirmed. "The tavern's just their meeting point. The goods are somewhere else, but that's where the deals happen. That's where you'll find who's running the operation on this end."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MTI4N2I4ZTM2ODQxODY4YTcxMjQwODU4MWNhNzc5"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Can't you just tell us who's in charge?" Kaelan asked, impatience edging her voice.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZWE0Yzk2NDVhNjRiYzI5MGE2OWM4Mjc2ZDE0NjA1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Thierry's mouth twisted in a wry smile. "Could be any one of three factions. They're being careful, using middlemen. That's why you need to go see for yourselves."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ODdjYzE4YmFjMzRjYzk5MTAzYjMxNjMyZTE0NTVm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Great,” Vertigo muttered.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MGZjZDBlNWIzYjRhY2ZiMjFlYTk5OTZjM2M3N2Nh"><span style="font-weight: 400">"One more thing," Thierry added, his expression grave. "There's talk that someone powerful is backing this operation. Someone with enough pull to keep the town guard looking the other way. If it's who I think it is..." He hesitated. "Just be careful."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NGE0Y2ZkNTA4YjQ4NWViYjM1OGE3NmQ5NTZkMTc4"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Dominique," Vertigo said flatly, the name leaving a bitter taste in his mouth.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NTNiNjIxMzM1OTQwMWRiODRlYjliZDQ4MDllY2Vh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Thierry's silence was confirmation enough.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMGQxYjEzMTJkYzQwNzA5YTNjMzEzMmM4OGQ2MzA3"><span style="font-weight: 400">"When should we move?" Kaelan asked, all business now that they had a clear objective.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNTgxMzliYzY4MDQ4YjI5YjEzMGQ3MDI1N2Q5MGVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Tonight," Thierry replied. "They're planning a major deal. Half the stolen medicine is changing hands. If you wait, it'll be gone soon."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOTJlYTc5YjVhNzQ1ZjliNTE4ZDRmYzQ3OGNkMjFl"><span style="font-weight: 400">"And the people they've taken?" Argent's voice had lost its flatness, a thread of genuine concern weaving through the question.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkODhiMzE0NDIyNzRhNzVhMTNlZWUwMjZmYTRkMzg2"><span style="font-weight: 400">The old man's face softened slightly as he looked at her. "Slated for transport in three days. A caravan heading south, to buyers unknown." He straightened his jacket, signaling the end of their meeting. "I need to go. Been here too long already. Good luck. You'll need it." They watched him disappear into the maze of alleys.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhN2RkZDA2YjZmNzQyMjQ4ZjQ4ZTgzYTJhMmY5NGY4"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Well," Vertigo said finally, breaking the tense silence. "This day just keeps getting better."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MzNlYzVmNDViMzQyMjFiZjJiZDU1MjU4N2UxODRj"><span style="font-weight: 400">"We need a plan," Kaelan stated. "We can't just walk in there and hope for the best."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOWFlYTA1MzQ0YTQ1MjViMTAzNGRhOTgwN2VlZjM5"><span style="font-weight: 400">"You two don't look familiar. I dunno. Get them drunk or even more stupid drunk and see what the fuck lets slip?" Vertigo suggested, running a hand through his hair as he tried to work through the implications. “If Dominique's involved, she'll recognize me instantly." A cold knot of dread formed in his stomach. "She might even be expecting us."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkOGI4MmFhZGJlZTRjNzA4Y2U4YjhhZDc2OGQ5YTNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Then you stay outside," Kaelan said decisively. "Argent and I will handle the information gathering. You can stay close as backup if things go wrong."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OWE4MjIzMjc2MTRmMTZiODY5YWJkNWQzMmU4ZmRk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertigo sighed, knowing they had few options. "Fine. But we need to establish signals, a rendezvous point, and an exit strategy in case it all goes to hell." He looked between the two angels, his expression serious. "And you two need to get your stories straight before you walk in there. One slip, and this whole thing falls apart."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMzk5NGFiNGIzYzQ3MTRhMjBjZjZjZmE0YjdkMWMy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaelan nodded, surprising him with her lack of argument. "We should find somewhere private to prepare." She glanced at the sky, where the afternoon sun was already beginning its descent. "We don't have much time."</span></p>
