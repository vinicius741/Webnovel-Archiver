<p class="cnMxNmQyNzYwMmI3ZjQzYjhiZDJlZjYyMGYyNDJiN2Jl" style="margin-bottom: 0">Eight days into negotiations and things were going well, at least according to what I had gathered from conversations between Masters Dooku, Qui-Gon, and Dyas. They had moved past the point of understanding each side’s point of view to sitting down and attempting to work out a mutually beneficial arrangement and a series of concessions each side could agree to, and it was all thanks to passing on something Jaster had told me in our first meeting in his tent.</p>

<p class="cnM5YzA2ZTM3M2UzZTQyZmJiNDUzYTZiY2Q2YjE2ZjBh" style="margin-bottom: 0">The New Mandalorians were pacifists and didn’t want to fight. They wanted to focus on rebuilding Mandalore, establishing trade, and building political relationships. In other words, they wanted the political victory, not the military victory.</p>

<p class="cnNiMmMyYjFkYjRmNjRkNjU4MWJmODhlZjFjZGJjYmM1" style="margin-bottom: 0">The solution was obvious and I was surprised they hadn’t considered it yet. It was <em>so obvious</em><span style="font-style: normal"> that I hadn’t even brought it up because I assumed it had been dismissed.

<p class="cnNjNDM0ZDZkMWE4MzRmN2M4YjVmOGFkZGRlNTU3ZTAz" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal">Their biggest disagreement was over just how much latitude the True Mandalorian faction, </span><span style="font-style: normal">once both groups incorporated under one banner, would have to go seek out jobs. Jaster wanted to be able to sell their services to anyone willing to pay, so long as the cause wasn’t awful. Satine wanted them to only sell their services to the Mandalorians’ allies, </span><span style="font-style: normal">and only with the approval of a civilian (pacifist faction) oversight committee. </span>It was causing some delays, but was still well within the projected timeframe for coming to some sort of reasonable conclusion and securing Mandalorian aid.</p>

Things like not being able to use my lightsabers, or being forced to stay on the ground, infiltrating an enemy camp without the use of the Force to capture an objective without being seen, or evading capture while being pursued through whatever terrain we ended up on that day.</p>

Having read through the Supercommando Codex, I couldn’t say I disagreed with it. Honestly, much of its contents appealed to me—both as a former Japanese person for whom the idea and importance of honor had been instilled since birth, and as a soldier, ensuring that the cause you were fighting for was worth fighting for and you were getting paid for it, </span><span style="font-style: normal">and </span><em>not</em><span style="font-style: normal"> having your life spent wastefully. </span><span style="font-style: normal">I would have liked to be able to refuse assignments, or retaliate </span><em>violently </em><span style="font-style: normal">against commanding officers making stupid decisions or abandoning, if not outright betraying me and my people.</span></p>

Or that it used to be much more common for Jedi to fall in love and start families, even if it was against the rules at the time—those rules used to be a lot less strict than they seemed today. </span><span style="font-style: normal">Or, using the example of Revan and Bastila Shan, love was a strength, not a liability—</span><span style="font-style: normal">which again, made me want to do research on exactly when the Order decided that normal, healthy human emotions were decreed to be universally bad for Jedi, who decided that, and why.</span></p>

It was impossible not to. The Masters didn’t put a stop to it however, which could be taken for silent approval, if not encouragement. I was confident they saw it as ‘strengthening ties with our allies’ or something along those lines. </span><span style="font-style: normal">I couldn’t help but feel that it was unprofessional, given that we were on the job, and had the potential to cause a conflict of interests, but… </span></p>

When they spoke ‘out of turn,’ smack them around a little to intimidate them and reinforce the idea of who was in charge with a little pain.

Tor wasn’t well-versed in the who’s who of Jedi, but he recognized two of them at least.

That was why he had people moving into place inside of Sundari with man-portable missiles, setting up on the roofs of nearby buildings to prepare for tomorrow. If the Jedi fucked off tonight, then tomorrow, Kryze and Mereel would show up, find the Jedi missing, and catch a missile to the face before they figured out anything was amiss.</span></p>

The other, the one Tor didn’t know, let out a quiet chuckle that turned into a sigh as he looked not at Tor, but at the girl. Tor cast a glance at her, but found she looked the same as she had before—too calm and like she was waiting for something.</p>
