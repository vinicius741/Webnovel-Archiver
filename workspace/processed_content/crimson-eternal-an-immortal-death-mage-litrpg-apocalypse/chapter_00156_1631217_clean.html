   After this, book 3's first chapter will be posted most likely on Monday following my new schedule. A schedule of 3 chapters a week for Wolf of the Blood Moon, 3 for Reaper's Resurgence, 3 for Crimson Eternal, and one for each of my secondary stories except when one secondary story is prioritized like one will be next week.
