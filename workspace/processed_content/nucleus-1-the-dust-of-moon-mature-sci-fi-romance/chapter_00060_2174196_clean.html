 <p>
  <strong>
   <span>
    Lustsong Woods, Shashvat Ananda (शाश्वत आनन्द), the Realm of Eternal Bliss
   </span>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Two large violet bees - each the size of a fox - hovered nervously to the side, holding what looked like a dress made from living plants. Their wings hummed anxiously.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A third bee moved forward slowly, carrying a crystal bowl filled with sparkling water. Steam rose from the water as the creature approached Lorna.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna lunged. The bee's compound eyes widened, its wings stopping mid-beat. It made a high-pitched whine as Lorna's arm wrapped around its body, holding it against her bare chest. The bowl fell and shattered. The liquid splashed across the ground as Lorna formed a finger-gun against the creature's head.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Tell me how to get off this world," Lorna demanded, her voice raw. The Weaver trembled against her, its body surprisingly warm. "Tell me! Or I swear I'll —"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "If you must unleash your anger, direct it at me," Kathrin said, her tentacles lowering. "The Weavers are peaceful. They have done nothing to deserve this!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Weaver in Lorna's grip made a soft, sad sound. Its complex eyes looked up at her, showing what seemed like fear. The creature's fur felt soft against Lorna's skin, and she could feel its rapid heartbeat.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Something in Lorna's chest tightened. She lowered her finger-gun as she stared into those golden compound eyes. She'd seen that same look before - in civilians caught in crossfire, in children separated from parents during evacuations.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Slowly, she let go. The Weaver flew away quickly, hiding behind Kathrin.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "There now, little one," Kathrin gathered the trembling creature into her arms, stroking its violet fur gently.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna crossed her arms over her bare chest, suddenly aware of her nakedness. The adrenaline was fading, leaving her feeling heavy and lightheaded. Silver patches of translucent skin appeared on her shoulders as her throat felt dry - signs of her depleted Aether as the Nucleus Virus responded to her emotions.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You shouldn't use such energy after the Tasting," a male voice said from the edge of the clearing. "The ritual leaves one's Aether quite low."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A tall figure stepped out from between the trees, with long ears rising from his dark hair. His bare chest showed lean muscle, and his skin had a purple tone. He wore a skirt of living plants and held a crystal vial filled with blue liquid.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna tensed despite her exhaustion. Her eyes fixed on the vial. "Indra-Sprite? You use it too?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Vyomendri," he said with a slight bow. "And yes - though ours is stronger than what you'd find in Mumbai." His violet eyes studied her. "The water our Weaver carried would have worked too. It has special properties here on Shashan."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I don't want your charity," Lorna said, though without much conviction. The silver patches spread further across her skin as her Aether continued to deplete.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It's not charity to prevent a warrior from collapsing," Vyomendri said, stepping forward. He pointed at her translucent patches. "Your body shows your need. Be kind to it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "My teammates," Lorna demanded more firmly. "Where are they?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Being tasted, as you were," Kathrin replied, still holding the frightened Weaver. "Emmanuel has taken quite well to it. Your friend Xin..." She smiled slightly. "He's more reluctant."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "If they're harmed—" Lorna started.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "They are treated as guests," Vyomendri interrupted, "albeit guests who must prove themselves free of corruption or bad intentions." He held out the Indra-Sprite. "The same as you."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "All is well," Kathrin said as she released the Weaver. The creature hovered at shoulder height with renewed purpose. "Fetch another bowl. Our guest still needs tending."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna frowned. "You call what just happened being treated as a guest?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Tasting is sacred to us," Kathrin said. Her tentacles swayed gently. "Through it, we know you carry no diseases that might harm our hive. We know you have the dormant Nucleus Virus, yet your mind remains your own. We know you can be trusted."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The two Weavers still hovered nearby, holding the plant dress like an offering.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The third returned with a fresh bowl of water, though it kept its distance.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Sweat rolled down Lorna's temple. The silver patches had spread to her stomach, and her hands shook slightly. The Weavers' wings hummed a soft, musical note as they moved closer with the dress.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "And if I hadn't passed your test?" Lorna asked.
  </span>
 </p>
 <span>
  <br/>
  If you spot this tale on Amazon, know that it has been stolen. Report the violation.
  <br/>
 </span>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vyomendri's expression darkened. "Then we would be having a very different conversation." He stepped forward, still offering the Indra-Sprite. "But you did. Now, will you continue to stand naked and depleted, or shall we move on to proper introductions?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Weaver with the water bowl came forward again, cautious but determined. This time, Lorna didn't stop it. The creature's eyes showed no fear now, only patience as it hovered near her shoulder.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The waters of Shashan cleanse more than just the body," Kathrin explained. "They restore what the Tasting takes."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna's jaw tightened, pride fighting with necessity. Finally, she reached for the vial. "The Indra-Sprite first."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He gave her the vial. The familiar blue liquid burned down her throat, but the aftertaste had notes she'd never experienced in Alliance versions – something almost musical.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The silver patches began to fade as her Aether replenished. The Weaver poured its bowl over her head. The water cascaded down, turning into iridescent steam that smelled of morning dew and distant thunder.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The last drop hit Lorna's shoulder and turned to steam, leaving her skin tingling with warmth. She inhaled sharply at the feeling.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Thank you," Lorna said cautiously to the Weaver with a slight nod.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Weaver bobbed up and down in response, still holding the empty bowl.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "But Radi-Mons like you murdered millions on Earth," Lorna said through the steam, her voice stronger now. "Why should I trust any of this?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Rakshasa are nothing like Skarn's mindless horde," Vyomendri replied. His expression hardened at Skarn's name. "We broke from the Hivemind's control a century ago. Some of us..." He gestured to himself, then to Kathrin, "...chose this form willingly, seeking something beyond human limitation."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The first Weaver approached again and began to clean Lorna's skin. Its touch was gentle, almost respectful, its fur releasing enzymes that dissolved every trace of dirt. Despite herself, Lorna felt her muscles relaxing.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You mentioned the Moondust Crystal earlier," Kathrin said, her tentacles coiling thoughtfully. "Perhaps our goals are more similar than you think."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna stiffened. "So, how did you know about—"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "But the Imperial Legion has already breached the Vault of Primal Urges," Kathrin cut in. "Their troops moved very efficiently. The Emperor's forces will likely reach the stone before you do."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You've been watching us?" Lorna gripped the empty vial tighter. The Weaver near her shoulder backed away slightly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vyomendri nodded. "The Rakshasa have eyes in the Sol System. We saw your forces fight the Imperium. It was our wormhole that took you in as you fell through Door Valkyris."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Alliance troops," Lorna's voice caught. "Did any—"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Most died," Vyomendri said more softly. "Though one survived - a man with silver arms and golden hair, like yours. The Imperium captured him alive."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Thomas." The name came out like a prayer. She stepped backward until her legs touched the plant bed she'd fled minutes earlier. She sat down, the living mattress giving way gently beneath her.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Weaver with the water bowl followed, hovering uncertainly nearby. Lorna glanced at it, then at Kathrin. "Weavers, right? They're yours? They won't hurt me?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "They exist to nurture, to create," Kathrin replied. "Violence is foreign to them." She gestured to the Weaver. "Let them tend to you. We have much to discuss."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna hesitated, then nodded slightly. The Weaver resumed its work, placing the bowl on a table before approaching her again. Its touch was gentle as it began grooming her tangled blonde hair. The sensation was strangely comforting.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vyomendri sat on a nearby root curved like a bench. "The Imperium doesn't understand what they're pursuing. Then again, perhaps your Alliance doesn't, either," he said, breaking off a piece of pink fruit from a bush. "The Crystal isn't just a weapon to be seized. Its power comes with complications."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What kind of complications?" Lorna asked. The two Weavers with the dress approached again, waiting for her permission. After a moment, she extended her arms, allowing them to dress her.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As Lorna put on the garment, the petal-like parts hugged her chest, its deep purple color contrasting with her pale skin. Her midriff remained bare above the leafy skirt. The vine around her waist tightened snugly but comfortably, molding to her shape.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A gentle, almost ticklish feeling spread through Lorna's body as small tendrils emerged from inside the dress. She lifted a leaf to see the tendrils extending towards her womanhood, forming something like silk underwear. The fabric pulsed, at first damp but quickly warming and drying.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That's not a simple answer," Kathrin said. She moved closer, her tentacles swaying in what Lorna was beginning to recognize as agitation. "But we'll share what we know - over the Rasa Tandava."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Rasa Tandava?" Lorna asked as the dress adjusted to her body. Behind her, the Weaver began separating her hair for braiding.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "A sacred gathering," Kathrin explained, coiling around a crystal formation that jutted from the ground like a throne. "Dance, feast, and discussion - where barriers between species fall away."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You want me to dance?" Lorna's voice sharpened. "After what just happened?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Tasting reveals the truth of flesh," Vyomendri said, standing up. "The Tandava reveals the truth of spirit." He stepped toward the trees, then stopped. "Your companions will be there. Emmanuel has already accepted our invitation."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Manny agreed to this?" The Weaver's gentle tugging at her hair was oddly hypnotic, making it harder to stay suspicious.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Enthusiastically," Kathrin smiled. "Especially after meeting Tanha."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "And Xin?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Still undergoing his Tasting," Vyomendri said. "Though I think he'll find his own path to acceptance, given time." He pointed toward a gap in the trees where a faint path wound deeper. "The gathering begins at moonrise. We can take you to your friends now, if you wish."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna felt the last braid fall into place, tiny blue beads catching the light. The dress had fully bonded with her skin now, feeling more like armor than clothing. She stood, testing her balance.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Before we go anywhere," she said, "tell me - why help us? What's your stake in this?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kathrin uncurled from her crystal perch, her tentacles moving with sudden intensity. "Because some of us know that Radi-Mons and humans need not be enemies."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Before Lorna could respond, a distant sound echoed through the forest - something between a roar and a song, haunting and fierce. The Weavers' wings hummed in response.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Ah," Vyomendri smiled, though it didn't reach his eyes. "The moons of Chandrak align. Shall we proceed?"
  </span>
