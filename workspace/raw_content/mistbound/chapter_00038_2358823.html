<p class="cnMzYzMwYzM2MDM4YzRmMGI4MDBiMjZlODBjOWE3OGJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">The next morning, after verifying that Parlor had not left any messages for them overnight, Maeryn set off to the airship academy. Frankie and Peter had already left by the time she’d finished breakfast, and she had no doubts they had headed the same direction, but Maeryn felt reasonably certain they wouldn’t see each other at all. Her engineers would be looking for others of their profession, no doubt, while she?</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOGEwMTg1MTFiNzQ5ZTlhZjUwY2FlNjZmZjFiYmU1"><span style="font-weight: 400">She needed a wing-combat specialist. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3NzY2NjRhOThlYzQzOGM5NThiMmMxMjU2ZTIzODZm"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was really the only hole left in her crew that Maeryn could see. Frankie and Peter served as interchangeable pilots and engineers. Dan was invaluable for his alchemical expertise and research skills. Terrance worked wonders at information gathering and wasn’t bad at close combat in a pinch - though perhaps she was underestimating him. It wasn’t exactly fair to judge him based on a single performance against Keith Laurant. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiNTBhZDc2N2ZmMTQ2YTRhZjMxOWYyYjdlZWM5Nzcy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Moving on, Ernesto would do decently as long-range magic support once he had a few ranged spells figured out, but ideally he wouldn’t be part of combat if it could be avoided. And Maeryn, given her years of experience as a hunter, could cover ground combat just fine.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YWZlNGM0ZWNhNzQ2ZWY4YWQyOWU4NDAxZjM5ZTkw"><span style="font-weight: 400">But in the air…? They were vulnerable. If any sky-beasts attacked, her team had no answer but to run away and hope the beasts couldn’t catch them. After what had happened at Cloudreach, with the aerial fight against Mistwarped Rocs, that wasn’t something Maeryn was particularly comfortable with, but she hadn’t been able to find any wing-combat specialists at Airspire. But there was sure to be plenty of them here in Zephyr, considering the airship academy.  </span></p>
<p class="cnM2MzhiMjQ5MmYwNzQ4ZDM5MzcyNzliMzE2NjUwMDI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">That said, Maeryn had doubts about whether she’d be able to afford to hire anyone… This was the capital of Zephyria, after all, and hiring someone from their academy itself had to be dreadfully expensive. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlYjU5MWE0M2ExOTQwMDc5Yzk0YWNiZWRhMTg0YWY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, it didn’t hurt to look, right? </span></p>
<p class="cnNmZjEzM2Q2NDc1MDRjODJhYWJhYzk2YWUxNTZhMDZm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn did her best not to gawk like a tourist as she walked briskly down the street to the academy. Thankfully, it appeared that some kind soul had arranged for maps at every intersection of streets, making navigating much easier. Especially considering that Maeryn had apparently chosen to try to get there during everyone’s morning commute; the streets were virtually packed with people, and the ambient noise of footsteps and gossip filled the air. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDU3N2IzYWJhYzQxOWU4NGMwYzI3MzcxN2Q2NTNm"><span style="font-weight: 400">After an hour of weaving through the streets and dodging the occasional airship cargo, she finally reached her destination—or rather, the imposing off-white walls surrounding it. They loomed ahead, smooth and unbroken, standing at least four meters high. Maeryn stopped, taking in the sheer size of them, and let out a sigh.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkODU3NTVhOWZlZTRkZDM4MTE5NWFkZjBmMjFjYTMw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Guess I gotta go around…” Making a guess on which direction she needed to go based on how she’d seen the city from the sky, Maeryn turned and started walking along the perimeter. Hopefully it wouldn’t take long to reach the actual entrance. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2MThhZTVjOTk4MTQ2NmQ5OTFkMWQ5ZGU1Njk3Zjdk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Luck was with her; it only took another quarter-hour to spot a gate that clearly marked the entrance inside. But that was where her luck ended. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhNWJkNTBiNmI2ZDQ0ODVhNDFhYTY0Y2Y1MWE1MTI0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No entry,” one of the guards stated firmly. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1OWQ3OGRkMDJmNjQ0NzU5YTczYWQ2YTgyN2Q1YzI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Students and instructors only,” his partner added, his eyes narrowed even as he fingers twitched towards a baton held at his side. “Do you have any identification?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3N2E3OGQyODZjZTQ3OTJhNzM1NTRlM2M0MjMyOGJj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um… no, I guess not. I was hoping to scout out a wing-combat specialist from the graduating class… but there’s no chance you’re going to let me in, are you?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyOGM5OTY5ZTZkYTQ5ODQ5NTIwZjdjM2ZiYjA2Zjc1"><span style="font-weight: 400">The second guard snorted. “Not on your life, lady.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM1MjJiYTY3YjkwNDQwYWFhMGM4MTMxM2MwNDJjOGE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps feeling a bit friendlier than his partner, the first guard sighed. “Used to be we’d let you do just that, but…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOGU0NTczOTNhZDQ1Mzc5NTA4NDRhYjA3MGNhYTdk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hank! We don’t talk about what happened!” the second guard snapped. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4Y2YwMGYwNWVjNTRjNzJiMjBiM2Y5MzMyNTFjNmNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, get that stick out of your ass, Jim. She’s a Captain, ain’t she? She’ll find out one way or another, and we both know it.” </span></p><span class="cjM5YTVjMzMyNWIxZjQyYmFhNWNhMzcwMzM2MzdkY2Rm"><br/>The narrative has been stolen; if detected on Amazon, report the infringement.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNjZTI4NTBkODQ0NDQxODk5MTEzZGY0NWMzOWNhZmYx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Jim turned to the side and spat in disgust. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTU3YjZlOTZkNTQ1Mjc5MWQ5NmZiZDZkZjAzYjRk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hank sighed and looked back at Maeryn. “Sorry about that. Things have been tense lately.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNjVjNWMyOGY2ODRkYjBiNmUwNjBjZWU0YTVjMzRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why? I’ve been in Airspire for a while, and Cloudreach before that, so I’m out of the loop. What’s going on?” Maeryn probed hopefully. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzYzFjOGU3MjhiNjQwMDdhY2NkOTA5ODgxY2I3ZTMz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hank grimaced. “Geovans, Captain. No one knows how, but there’s some… well, let’s just call it what it is. There’s a Geovan terrorist cell somewhere on Zephyr. A few weeks ago, they tried to kill everyone in the academy using an alchemical toxin of some sort. It’s got everyone on high alert.” He reached up and rubbed his eyes wearily. “What are those dirt-loving bastards thinking?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3MzVkNzE0YjdiZTRjYWFhYjRkZTNhYWUxMGE0OGQz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ve told you, Hank, they were trying to kill our best and brightest because they’re jealous of how well we have it up here! Those breath-forsaken mole rats refuse to understand that we’re not the ones responsible for their so-called Mist crisis, and just want to drag us down in the mud with them!” </span></p>
<p class="cnM4YjMyZTlhYTQwMzQ0YmJhZWNmNGJkOGFlYzM2ODEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn’s jaw dropped. She’d never, ever heard such racist vitriol towards her people, and for a long moment she was simply astonished that someone would not only think that way about them, but dare to say it out loud in front of her. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhNDcwZWFkOTZmYjQxZTE5YTAxNjg1ZTY2MjkzYTJk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then the words truly registered, and anger started to bubble in her gut, reaching up towards her lungs. But she couldn’t say the words she dearly wanted to. Not without exposing her own origins. And if there really was a Geovan terrorist cell, then doing that would be a surefire way to being put in irons… or worse. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkZTlhZTgzNmRhYzQ0NGI4MjY0MDE5ZDYxOTcwMjk2"><span style="font-weight: 400">The realization that she had to put up with the racist guards burned like acid in her throat. “Well then,” she somehow managed to say, hating every word that came out of her mouth instead of the retort she so sorely wished to inflict, “let’s hope the cell is dealt with soon. Though I probably won’t be around to see it; I’m only here for a few days on business.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MGY0OThmYjcyMzQzYzg5ZTdmNTFlZDFiYzVkMzdk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hank nodded sympathetically. “Rotten luck, I know. All the students and staff are basically quarantined on campus until this whole thing is solved; last time was too close. This whole thing is robbing a lot of people of good opportunities.” He let out a long sigh. “The Council of Winds’ll catch ‘em sooner or later. Sorry we couldn’t help you.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZGNiYzMyMTE0MjRhOGU4NzEyZTdkOGZiYzMzOTQ4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not your fault. You’re just doing your job,” Maeryn assured him, not daring to look at Jim for fear of not being able to keep the rage from her eyes. Her arms tightened as she imagined using every ounce of her hunter training to knock the racist ass on his backside and show him exactly what she thought of him… but no. A moment’s satisfaction wasn’t worth the consequences. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0YTg1MjE0NjQyYzQwMzI4ODQxNGU1M2VlYTQyNDFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn closed her eyes and forced herself to relax, raising one hand in farewell as she turned on her heel and walked away. “Thanks for the information,” she said, perhaps a bit more curtly than she wanted. Considering how much she’d had to reign in her temper, though, she simply couldn’t find it in herself to care. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlMjk3MjE1MWJhYzQ3ZmZiNTcxZWQzOWEyNTA1OGEy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead, she focused on the information she’d received as she made her way down the street, with no real destination as she gathered her thoughts. “A Geovan terrorist cell, huh…?” she murmured under her breath. Breathtakingly rage-inducing slurs aside, Jim might’ve had a point: it wasn’t hard to picture a group of Geovans trying to force Zephyr to land, to preserve what mana there was remaining. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1YWY0YTQxMjlkMDQ4MzE5Y2MyYjdlZjZkODQxMGU1"><span style="font-weight: 400">She could almost see it—fellow Geovans, driven to desperation, deciding to take matters into their own hands. Could it be that some Geovans, like her, had chosen to become more proactive about the mana depletion and Mist issues? Or… had one of the Elders quietly set up the mission without getting approval from the others? There were a few she could believe doing that; notably, Elder Liora had staunchly blamed the Zephyrians for the mana crisis for as long as Maeryn could remember. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhYzE0ZWY1ZDNmOTQ1YjY5NTcwZDJiNjhjZjA4N2E0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What should I do here…?” Maeryn wondered quietly. Should she try to find the Geovans? Try to stop them from instigating a war? Convince them to go home? Maybe send a message with everything they’d learned? Or… should she work with them? Zephyr was absolutely enormous, after all. If they could force Zephyr to land, it would certainly force their government to notice that the Mist was everyone’s problem. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1NmYxODI1MTI2ODQ2MThhYjM3MzU2ZDA4ZWQ4ZTIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn hadn’t forgotten that the Zephyrian Research Council had sat on the knowledge of the Mist-Undead link for the better part of a decade. What if there was more knowledge like that? What if they already knew how to undo the Mist, and were just holding onto it until the Geovans died? But Maeryn would bet everything she owned and then some that if they </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">did </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">know that much, they’d use it for Zephyrian benefit. If Zephyr landed, they wouldn’t have a choice. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4MTAxMGM0NDUwNDRkZjBiZjQxZjRhNTJjNzMzNDU4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn’s heart beat faster as she contemplated the pros and cons of trying to dissuade the terrorist cell vs joining them. The air felt heavy, pressing down on her like the weight of her own indecision. What was the right course of action here? </span></p>
<p class="cnM0MDJhM2UwOTU1NTQzY2FiM2FjNjI0ZDY1MWUzM2Q0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn kept walking, watching but not really seeing the people around her, bustling in the city streets. “I… I think I need more information,” she finally murmured. “I don’t even know for sure if there really are Geovans here, and even if they are, I wouldn’t know how to find them or what their goals actually are.” Her face hardened as she made a decision. </span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTAwNDRkNzMyMTQ5NDE5NWIxYzgyYTZlZmY5NDIz"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was time for Terrance to take to the streets and do what he did best: information gathering on the wrong side of the law. </span></p>
