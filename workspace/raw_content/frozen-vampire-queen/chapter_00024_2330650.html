<p align="left" class="cnM1ZTAxNmU5ZjFjMjQxMzZhN2IwNTAwNGQwYzBlMDg4">As the towering gates came closer, Emma’s heart grew more relentless in her chest. The walls were a constant reminder of the rain of arrows she’d suffered previously. Her gaze flickered at the archers on the stone structure with a hint of apprehension.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM4MjBmODQ0N2RmNDQ4NjBiMGZmNTUyNGRkZWYxYTkw">Sora noticed and gripped Emma’s hand even tighter. “Don’t worry. You look nothing like you did before.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNiZGJmZDg1YTI2ODQ2ODNiNzNmMjhhNTg4MDJkY2Nl">“You’re forgetting something,” Emma said as they joined a line of peasants, “you were with me then. If they recognize you, then it will only be so long until they recognize me.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMwOGI3YTllMmRhYTQwMDA4MDRmOTc4ZGY3ZDgzNmRh">Karlack frowned, holding the reins of arrow in her hand as she led Arrow. “Don’t worry, Mistress! I’m in charge of cleaning up, remember?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMzNjdkZDJkM2ZjNjRjZTk4YjliMGRkNmMxMjYxNGM1">Emma rubbed the bridge of her nose. “That’s the part that worries me.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNjY2Q5NmZjNDVmYzRlMjNhNDFkN2Y5NWQ4MjZmOGQ1">The group halted before a guard who stared at them. “You’re an odd looking bunch,” the man said, looking towards Lunaria’s horns and pointed ears in particular. “Did any of you come upon a stampede on your way over here?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM0NDJkMTQ5NGE5MDRjZjZiZTBkNzIzZDcxMzE4Mjlm">“A stampede?” Emma asked.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM5ZGFiY2E4MjdhODRmNzFhMDA2NTE5MzdjYmQwMGZl">The guardsman pointed towards the domesticated mammoths in the distance. “The tusk behemoths went wild for some reason. There’ve been a few reports already. Especially in Arondale to the East.” The man pointed towards the East with his fingers. “We’ve been asking anyone to see if they know anything, but no one could point us to anything.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM4MTcwYjA0NGMzNzQ2ZGVhNmM1MGFjOGVmOTlkZGQ0">He looked once more towards Lunaria. “There were sightings of a dragon reported though. You wouldn’t happen to know anything about that, would you?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNjMGQ1MTRkMzg1MjQ3ZGQ4MGQwNWRkOWJmMTE2NjQw">The dragon in question shrugged. “I’m not exactly related to those creatures. I’m just a dragonborn. I may worship the dragons, but I can’t control them.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNjOWQ3ZDhlOGZkMzQ3ZDI4ODJkODZlNzlhZWM5NDRm">“I see,” the man said with a strained smile. “Keep your noses clean while your here, and we’ll have no problems. If you run into any trouble in the city, make sure you report it to the guards.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM3YzljMGI4ZGY2YTQ0NDBhODU0MTA2MjU0YzliNDQ2">The man waved them in, and the group slipped into the city.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNiMTQ4MzEzZDBmZjQ0OWNiNDUxMjkxNWE5ZDYxNzYx">A sigh of relief escaped Emma’s lips as she put a hand on her chest. “I thought for sure we’d have to produce documents or something.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMzZWQxZjg2OWQ5NDRhMzJiYTRmYTc4NGRjYWZjZGY1">Lunaria shook her head. “This place is an open city like the three others. The Dawn believes that openness promotes happiness. A welcoming community is sure to be happier than those who close off themselves from the outside. It is all remnants of Her teachings.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM1MjU2OTc4MzE5OTQ0NzA5MjYyNGRkODYzMWFjMTA4">“Her?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMwZmMwM2M2OWExNTRmNWM4MWFlMzAwZjAzZGRhYmU3">Lunaria pointed towards a fountain statue in the middle of the cobbled road. Water poured around a beautiful winged woman with a smile. The whole thing was a grey color, except for the small orange orb she held in her hands. She caressed it to her chest as something precious to her.</p><span class="cjJlOGJlNDYzM2ZlNjQyNDhiMTc5ZjY4NzJhMDUwNTdk"><br/>This content has been misappropriated from Royal Road; report any instances of this story if found elsewhere.<br/></span>
<p align="left" class="cnM4ZGU2ODMzNzRiMzQ3MmViYjA2NTYyZmMyZDU3ZjYz">“Lady Reimei—The Goddess of Dawn.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNjNjJiOTEwYmViMjQ5YTRiYjEyOTVlZTRjMzJjN2E4">The vampire’s eyes narrowed at the statue. “I bet she doesn’t like me very much.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNkZWEzYmI3MjUyODQ0YThiY2JmNDJiOGRkMzBlNWE4">Though, to Emma’s surprise, Lunaria shook her head. “It’s not that Lady Reimei doesn’t like you, but her followers will definitely not be fond of you.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNlMTBhMWMyNzU0NDQ0MjlhYzhhNTQ4N2RhMDJjZDA4">“I don’t understand. Doesn’t she produce the light which causes me grievances?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM5NjZhNTA3MTVkYTQ3YmM4YzVlYWUxNzcxMzFjNTVi">“That’s more to do with your constitution than anything. I think it’s more to do with Lady Hakumei.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM2MDk1YjhmYmYzMDQwOGZiYmRlMDFjZTc5ZmE1Yjg0">The vampire raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM0NTA3NTNjMzVhZDRiNDJiZGU2N2RiM2Y4MTQ5MDQ5">“I’m not sure it’s a good idea to tell you everything right away. What do you think of gods and goddesses?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM4ZDUzMmE3NjlkNzRjZGY5MjVmMjUwMzc5OGIwMmI2">“I never believed in them, but when I arrived here, I started to change my mind. After all, there were too many things that happened for it to be a coincidence.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM3NGFmMDE4YjAzMzQ5YzFiODBhNzhhMmU4YzlkZDll">The dragon nodded and gestured to the nearby people moving along the street. “See, they can smile because they believe that their goddess is watching over them.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNhYjYwN2Q0OGI4MjQwOTE4ZmUwODdiZjFmMmU0Zjgz">Sora grabbed onto the dragon’s hand. “My papa always said that it was bad luck to talk about Lady Hakumei.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNlNjE5ZWY5MGY3YzQ5NjZhNGJjZGI3MzI5ZDI0ZmJm">The dragon sighed and looked forlorn for a brief moment. Then she smiled and patted Sora’s head. “Your papa must have been wise, but I think he was missing some context.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMyZThlNzg1Nzg0NjRkNmM4ZjQyYjAxMjE0Y2UxNzBm">Sora placed a finger on her chin, wondering what the dragon was talking about.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNmOTEzZjg1YTQ0NjQ5ZWNhYmIxNzY2OTg4ZWNlNTI1">“It’s something to chew on for later. Rather than that, we should find out where we’re going to stay for the night. After hearing your stories, It’s occurred to me that you’ve yet to stay somewhere nice. Traveling on the road must’ve been hard.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNkMTdjYmMzYzRhZTQ4YjA4YTQ0NzU0OTMxNWFkNGY3">Emma cracked her shoulders and neck. “It’s been really rough. I could use a professional massage.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM5NGU4YmNmMGRmYjRhMmU4ZTIzYzg0MjkxOWM4Y2Nh">Lunaria grinned at the vampire and wiggled her fingers. “I’ve adept hands, and I’m sure I can deliver you to heaven.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMyNDI4ZmVhZWQ3NzQyOWRhMDVhYzJjYzVlNDdkMWIx">Emma felt those same butterflies crawling around in her stomach and the heat rushing to her face. <em>There’s no harm in a massage, right? </em>Somehow, the vampire managed to convince herself that a massage was fine.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNhYTU3MjhmNzExNDRmZDc5NTg4YjE3YzkzMTA5NDli">While the group walked towards an uncertain destination, Emma looked around at the buildings surrounding them in the entrance plaza. All around her there were stone structures, and many of them had large crosses or sunlight paintings on them. Those large birds from before still flew around the city. Most incredibly, there were perches for them to land on.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMxZGY4YTE2ZWZmMzQzY2Q4YjJhZjBlOWJhZDdiYTAx">Looking closer, Emma could see that some of them were saddled up with people riding on their backs. Every couple of birds had a rider, and each rider had a long firearm strapped to their side. They reminded Emma of muskets she remembered seeing in a past life that was growing ever distant.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNlYzI4ZmUwMmUwZTQ4ZTQ5OWZmYWYyYjcxMzJmNjc5">Sora followed the vampire’s eyes and grinned. “Those are some of the most elite units my father told me about. They’re this kindom’s Silver Claws.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNkYTA1MGYzZTBkYTQ4YWZiNTViM2IzY2U5YzU2NDVm">“Silver Claws? And why does little Sora know about them?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMwOTllMmViZTVlOTRmNmQ5OWMwNjQ2MWFhNGZiZWM5">The little girl looked down awkwardly. “I...I…”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMyNGMyODcxYjdiNzQ1ZWJiYjA5MGI0YTFhMjZlMjYw">Emma reached down and patted the girl’s head. “You don’t have to tell me everything right now. It’s better to take these kinds of things slowly and not force them.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMxNDMwMGM4ZDkxOTQ2MmNhYTE2MmU4MmFkYTg0NTAw">Sora wrapped her arms around Emma and couldn’t help giggling to herself. She whispered, though Emma’s ears picked up on it. “You sound like a mother for once.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMwZDZjZDZjNGIyZDQ0YjhhNWJkYzI0ZjcxMzNlODNj">Emma resisted the urge to pick up the little girl and spin her around. She found herself getting cute aggression, so she turned to the only being that could give her normal aggression. She frowned at Karlack who was observing them with a strange smile. The vampire mouthed some words that went unrecognized by the maid.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNjZGEwMzIxN2E1ZTQ3NjE5ZTgyYTdiNTMxMzVjYzU4">Karlack pretended to not understand and winked at the motherly vampire.</p>
