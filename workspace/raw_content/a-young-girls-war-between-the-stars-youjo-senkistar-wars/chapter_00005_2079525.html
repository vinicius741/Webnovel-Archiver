I followed that with a big mug of the local coffee equivalent sweetened to my linking and made my way to a table. I demolished my breakfast quickly and did away with my tray.</p>

The Trade Federation is blockading another agri-world. Price of grain shipped from that world just skyrocketed. It’ll take about a week for the prices to change on everything here in the core to reflect it. By this time next week, the cost of bread from the primary supplier on Coruscant will be double what it is now, until they find another source for flour. Which will be from,” I flicked at the tablet, “this planet. Also in the rim. Most likely next on the list of planets to get a visit from the Trade Federation.”</span></p>

They blockade a world. They raise the price of exported grain. The people that depend on that grain switch suppliers, going for either the next cheapest option at the time or the closest to a main trade route—which is also usually the cheapest because of shipping costs. The Trade Federation follows the money and goes after that planet next. And so on and so forth. Except they’re also doing it for fruits, vegetables, meat production—the entire food supply is under attack.”</p>

A moment later, a herd of children rushed in, all roughly around my physical age. All of them quickly went to a cabinet in the corner and began pulling out what looked to my eyes like over-sized colanders covered in LEDs and putting them on their heads. As they finished donning their headgear, they took up positions around the room—not quite orderly rows, but close enough, and with enough distance that they wouldn’t hit each other. Then, they brought out the small lightsabers at their sides and flicked them on.</p>

The military otaku in me wanted nothing more than to tear one apart and learn how it worked, and then use it on something. I had seen enough vids to know these things were capable of cutting, burning, or melting through just about anything.</p>

<p class="cnNmNzViMjVlZGM2MDQwODBhNTYxN2E1YTc0YjU0ZGE1" style="margin-bottom: 0">The old Jedi chuckled and gestured. From a crate beside the locker, a bunch of drones rose up, one tracking out in front of each of us. A moment later, I heard the whine of multiple lasers charging and thumbed the loaner saber in my hands on, lighting up a blue beam of light in front of me. “What’s the goal here, master Yoda? To just deflect shots, or reflect them back at the drone?”</p>

<p class="cnNjNzhkNjI3YjJmZDRkOTM5YjUwYzk4MDE0YzM4MTEy" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Confident, are you?” he asked, as I raised the blade and intercepted a shot, sending it into the ceiling. “Avoid being hit, you must. Reflect them, if you can.”</p>

<p class="cnMxZDEyOTFiNzY5MjQ2MGRiYTY0ZjEwOWNkYjAyOTU2" style="margin-bottom: 0">Nodding, I focused on the drone and settled into the rhythm of blocking and dodging, having gotten a feel for how the drones escalated on the flight to Coruscant. I had never held a lightsaber before, but I <em>had</em><span style="font-style: normal"> used swords—in my first life and my second. In the first, sports had been required in both high school and college, and while I hadn’t kept up with them later in life due to time constraints, I had taken both kendo and later fencing. In the Empire, those sabers on the uniform weren’t for show—they taught us how to use them. </span><span style="font-style: normal">So I wasn’t completely starting from zero when it came to how to hold one of these—I just had to ignore all the stuff about edge alignment.</span></p>

All you really needed to do was put the blade where the bolt was going to be, before it got there. The </span><em>before</em><span style="font-style: normal"> part of that was a bit harder than just dodging, but very doable. Once I could consistently block them, I began playing around with the blade angle to learn the angles to properly reflect them. I used the Force a bit to guide me to get an example, then ignored it for the angles in favor of calculating them myself—something I had been taught to do in the Empire to calculate bullet and spell trajectories and either dodge or shield; the only difference this time was that I needed to also calculate a return trajectory based on the angle of the shot, angle of the blade, and even the force I put into any intercepting strike.</span></p>

<p class="cnNhNmZhODI0MDYyOTQ4MDM4ZTcwYmEwYTY5MDIwM2Qy" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">It was fun and entirely too soon, the class ended. Yoda dismissed everyone and from there, the students made their way to an indoor training room—with me following them, as that’s where the groove worn into the routine of this place in the Force led. I didn’t recognize the Jedi master overseeing the training, but I made an effort to memorize his name and face when he introduced himself. From there, he used the Force to lift a bunch of sections of the floor and turn the room into an obstacle course—albeit a fairly simple one. Then, he turned us loose and instructed us to navigate to one end of the room and back. Shrugging, I took off running.</p>

I collected a plate and found a seat, and soon found myself joined by the same girl I’d spoken to the previous night. Obi, as she had eventually asked me to call her by the time we parted ways last night, sat across from me with a smile. “How did you like your first day of training?”</p>

The problem was that she was young and frustrated by what she saw as a lack of progress. She didn’t need me telling her things she had likely already heard. What she </span><em>needed</em><span style="font-style: normal"> was a sympathetic ear, which I was happy to give for the later reciprocity and expectation of being able to use our bond to call in favors fro</span><span style="font-style: normal">m</span><span style="font-style: normal"> each other—but it wasn’t the </span><em>only</em><span style="font-style: normal"> thing she needed.

I couldn’t hold everything in place in the air yet, but moving static obstacles onto the ground and stacking blocks was easy enough. Every late afternoon, I made a new obstacle course for myself, released a trio of drones, and ran the course while deflecting or reflecting blasts from the drones.</p>

Many of us have been speaking about it, privately. There isn’t a consensus on what to do with you. Some of us want to move you up to more advanced lessons, because at this point you’re already doing it yourself. There are some problems with that, however. Certain masters feel it would be showing favoritism. Others feel that you would be advancing too rapidly—that you should take being in the basic lessons as a hidden lesson in </span><em>patience</em><span style="font-style: normal">. </span><span style="font-style: normal">Others, like myself, don’t like seeing raw talent wasted but the concerns of the others prevent us from acting in more direct ways.”</span></p>

There were eight of us crammed onto a small ship for a trip out to the Unknown Regions and Ilum. It was two weeks there and back—most of that time spent in a jump off of any of the normal hyperspace routes, one that had faded into the annals of history as Ilum no longer received much in the way of traffic save for the Jedi pilgrimages.</p>

It was a mixture of human and near-human species, pretty typical of what I had seen in the academy so far. For some reason, after the first day being stuck in the ship, they gave me a lot of space. I wasn’t entirely sure why, really. All I did was my usual routine of training and research. For some reason, that intimidated them—I could feel the emotion coming off of them, along with a bit of fear. I’d even caught a conversation where master Jinn had reassured them that no, what I was doing wouldn’t be expected of them any time soon.</p>

The rest of the kids were crammed between one more room with four bunks for the girls and the living room for the boys. That would have left one of the girls the odd one out, or sleeping on the floor, but Obi took pity on me. That, or someone had filled master Jinn on my sleeping arrangements. Either way, I wound up bunking with Obi, </span><span style="font-style: normal">with</span><span style="font-style: normal"> the older girl using me as a body pillow. </span><span style="font-style: normal">I didn’t mind too much, if only because her presence wasn’t </span><em>psychically grating</em><span style="font-style: normal"> against my own when I tried to sleep.

I spun up one of the formulas I’d gotten working in recent days, producing a weak shield—it wasn’t omni-directional nor was it enough to stop a blaster yet, but it was enough to shield me from the wind or make an umbrella.</p>
