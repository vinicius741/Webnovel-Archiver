I did note that they took some extra safety steps to protect their biological workers and sent those off to send out as a policy update to set the standard across the board for our safety expectations. The interviews with their management, both for the office and the plant floor, didn’t turn up anything but a bunch of people who are happy to be taking home more money. </span><span style="font-style: normal">The financial review showed everything was above board.
