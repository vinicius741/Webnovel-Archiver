<p class="cnMyYzE0NTMyYjMzMjRiN2E5NmNhNWZkOWM2OGM2NzY2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Outside Chamber 42, Governor's Palace (總督宮), No. 777, Songren Road, Xinyi District, Taipei, Taiwan, Imperium of Dragons Territory</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MWQ4NmQzNTFkZDQ3ZjE4YmYwMzg3ZTcwZGQzMGVi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><img alt="Nucleus: The Dust of Moon" src="https://nucleusseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ch31.png"/></span></p>
<p class="cnNlZDM3ZjEzOGE0MjQ3MDk4YWFjYWQ0ZDcwNmYxMWZh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><span style="font-size: 1.5em"><strong>D</strong></span>ilinur couldn't predict what awaited her now. Being summoned at this time of day was never a good sign for government agents like herself; it usually meant demotion, corporal punishment, death or things even worse.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4Y2E4N2M5Y2M1ODQ5MTdhNjlkNjE5Y2IxZGNlNjk5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The crimson corridor stretched before her, bathed in the glow of cold fusion lanterns. Each step of her leather boots was a drumbeat on the polished marble, accompanied by the sways of her onyx red silk robe.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OGNiNjM3NzY3NjRjMzQ4ZDJhZDljMzA3NzdhMjg5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She arrived at the appointed room — Chamber 42. The opulent door stood before her, its surface an ornate tableau.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZDkxOTllOTIxNTRlZDQ5YTM4YTZiMmJlZTEzNjc1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Through the seams of the door, she could hear the sounds of carnal indulgence — Governor Zu-Shao Qin's deep voice moaning in pleasure, accompanied by the soft whimpers of a woman and the wet sucking sounds of fleshly desires. With her sharp hearing, she recognized the cadence of Secretary Shazmeen Varma's breaths between each of Shao's groans — knew them as intimately as one knows the blade they've crossed in battle.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OTg3MDJlYTFkYzQxNTQ5NDgwODYwMmEzOWI1ODky"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur's hand hesitated on the handle, feeling the vibrations of what lay beyond. Her little finger, half-sprouted and motionless, could feel the cool metal.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDc4YTkxM2ViMjQwY2ZhZjAxZWUyMjQzM2U3Yzgz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As silence fell like a shroud behind the door, it hissed open, revealing the aftermath of hedonistic ritual within. Shazmeen emerged. Stains of white, the spoils of her labor, marred her blouse near her chest and lower lip, evidence of the appetites she had pleased, trophies of her conquest over the man who ruled them both.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYjIwYTk1MDg1NTQ3M2ZiZDFlYWNhZjE1NzgxNzRi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Good evening, Dinu. Here to receive your punishment by Governor Qin?" Shazmeen taunted, her voice smooth like velvet and laced with the taste of shared complicity. The Secretary of Province knew her place in the Governor’s mind, and certainly believed it was above Dilinur’s.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNmJmODUwYzk4MzRiZWZhNTFhY2QzYzVmNTY3NWNh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"None of your business, Shazmeen," Dilinur responded evenly, trying to hide the revulsion stirring in her stomach.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMGNjYjAyNzdhYTQ1ODM5YTRjNjA1M2NkYTJmZjE1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You know, your career would have been much easier if you used your femininity more. Appeal to…the base needs of men above us," Shazmeen held up a vial containing more of the white fluid, fresh and thick, its source unmistakably clear.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNzU2YjZkYjZmOTRmNjVhMzk4Mzc3ZWZkZjQxYjNh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"To each our own, Shazmeen," Dinu said cautiously, averting her gaze.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMWU5N2I0NmI2OTRiOWI4YzUxYjZiZGMyNTU1MTIw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Pride can only get you so far, Dinu," the Djinno woman said in a condescending tone.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MDFhZjQ1ZjYzMDQzZTQ5NWY3ZTZjNjg2NDgwZWU0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As Shazmeen left, Dilinur entered the lion's den, the lingering scent of the man’s release heavy in the air. The door sealed behind her with a quiet click as she crossed into the room. "Governor Qin, I have come as you requested."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZWIyNWZmNTYyOTQ4NDhiZGQ4MjMwOWRhMzNkYTk5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Good, Dinu. Good..." Governor Zu-Shao Qin reclined lazily on an opulent throne-like chair, his usual attire of red and black robes undisturbed but radiating an aura of satisfaction. The air itself seemed to bend around him, laced with the remnants of Shazmeen's ministrations.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZTBiZjM1OGRiZDQ2NjFiNDA5NGNkZGY1NzU1ZDk2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Sit," he commanded, gesturing toward a plain wooden chair opposite his own — a mere dwarf compared to his grand seat.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0M2MwMTllMmQyYzQ4ODViZWY0MzFmMDlkMzkzZDQ5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As she complied, her muscles coiled tight, Dilinur's gaze skittered across the room, taking in the dragons embroidered on fine tapestries and the golden chalices standing sentinel on a sideboard crafted from darkwood.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YTg1OTBmMzQ0ZjRhMGU5MDUzMGMwOGYyMDVjNGJh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"So, once again you have chosen to protect insignificant civilians while letting our enemies slip away. Subject S has fled from Earth, a ZenFusion engineer has escaped with a copy of the Moondust Crystal data to Alliance lands. And that little android awarded to him, U6-M9 — gone! No one at the Logistic Hub could tell me what happened. Useless Peons," Shao began, his voice low. "You have all failed me."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZDNkZTY2YjJhYTQ4MjViYzQ2ZTMwYTcwMWQxMTZi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yes, milord," Dilinur murmured, bowing her head slightly, though the iron grip of intimidation circled her throat like a collar.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlODRhOTYzMmEwNDQxNzc5YmFmN2MwYmYwN2FhMjdj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">“You have one chance to explain yourself,” Shao said with eyes that glinted like sharp daggers.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZDA2MWE2OTU1YjQ3MDFiYjUwNjI0ZjI0MzgwMjJk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"I did what was best for the people — and our public image." Dilinur reported carefully, her fingers drumming silently on her thighs.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NmYyMjJlNTk1NDQzY2ZhZDliZmMwZTQyNDI0OGVi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Shao's eyes gleamed with cold interest. "Public image."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MGQzYmY5NDdjYjQ4YWI4ZTMzMjhkN2IzMmIxYzIz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yes, milord. In light of recent Radi-Mon incidents and growing distrust towards the government, showing willingness to protect should calm the people's minds." Dilinur noted, her tone neutral but weighted.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjY2JkYWI4MzdjNTQ1YzA4YTE5MTUzNmIwNDJhZThi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Hmm." Shao's fingers rested on his armrest. "It would be pleasant to have less stupid locals joining the Sand Lotus."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNGE1ODA2ZWFlOTRmM2E5MzkyZGJlOTllOTBjODA0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Indeed. In the long run, it'd also lessen the need for excessive security, the cost conserved could be funneled to your expenditure in hosting social events and — other equally pleasant activities —" Dilinur listed, before Shao cut her off with a wave.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MGQ3Mjk4ZjQ3NDRhMGY5ZDE0NzRlNWI3MWUwNTlm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"No need to remind me," he smiled, though it didn't reach his eyes. Shao's smile remained cold, calculating. "On a side note, while I could care less about a missing android, there must be a reason why someone would take her."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmOTU2ZDBhNGE2NjQzYTZhYzkxNDEzY2E5YTc2NTc5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur could feel her own posture tensing, however slightly. "My apologies. I should have foreseen the contingency."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NGQ3YmU3NjRhODRiMmM5MjZiYzVmZmFmNWE4ZDNh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You should have," Shao leaned back in his throne-like chair, swirling the contents of his chalice, "But such menial tasks are beneath us. Have Seneschal Wei investigate it."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNzIxMzUyYTBhODRkNWRiYzM3ZDQ0ODgyMmQ1MTAx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"It shall be done," Dinu bowed once more, deeper this time as she picked up the lingering scent of Shazmeen's earlier visit.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTNmZTUzYWY3NzQ4Y2ViN2JkYzEwNTEzNWI1ZWJh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"This brings us to the next matter we should address," he continued, unfurling a dark yellow holographic scroll across the distance between them. The scroll depicted the Moon’s cratered visage, marked with cryptic symbols. "The Moondust Crystal is nestled within an assemblage. The visualized data shows that this Vault of Primal Urges is located deep in the core of Osram. You will retrieve it."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZTFmNDA4ZGY4YTQwNDJiYzViOTJlMWU5ZDhjMDJh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Of course, it should be a most exhilarating task," Dilinur focused on the map, noting a location marked for extraction.</span></p><span class="cjdjMWU0ZjIzZTg0ZjQxMjhhZDk4MDMwNzI2M2M3MDRi"><br/>This tale has been unlawfully obtained from Royal Road. If you discover it on Amazon, kindly report it.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNkNjFhZDE1MmEzMjQ3NDliMjlkOTkxMGEzMTliZjBi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"That it is. For this time, Prince Joon-Seok of the Choson Peninsula will assist you," Shao said, the name rolling off his tongue. "He is knowledgeable in operations beyond Earth. Our military exercises have also ended prematurely, our troops recalled to join this mission."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNGUxNmI3Mjk3MzQwMTU4YzkwOGEyZWE4ODEwZGRh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yes, milord. And I assume an individual of such stature demands some protocols?" Dinu replied carefully.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NGZlNjEzNTA5ZDQ4OTY4MmNhNDMyNzBmNTQyMzM1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"As one of the Emperor’s most favored psionic champions, to have Joon-Seok join us is an immense honor," Shao’s gaze dropped, a deliberate trail from her eyes down to her chest. She felt the weight of his stare like a physical touch, lecherous and calculating, as if undressing her resolve. "You’ve been selected to be the Hostess as the Prince visits Taipei tomorrow. In your absence, your usual administrative duties in Taipei will be handled by Seneschal Wei Cheng and Secretary Shazmeen."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDYyYTJkNWM5MzQ2ZDJhMzc3YzYwNmIxMzY4NGYw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dinu fought not to squirm under the scrutiny, to maintain the composure expected of her station. In the past, Shao had taken advantage of her subordinate position in various ways, ones that had disgraced women like herself.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZDdiMzkyMTczZjQ2MTI4ZDMxYTYxYzgwYzVmOGNl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Thank you, Governor. I’ll be sure to observe the protocols expected," she managed, her voice steady but her pulse quickened, her hands clenched into fists, her mind racing with estimations when this meeting would end.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNWIwODM2MDNmODQzMTM5YWJiNjEzN2M0YTBiNDE3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Not yet!" Shao's voice interrupted as if he could sense Dinu's thoughts. His eyes narrowed as he continued, "It is time for your carnal punishments."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNWU3YTg4N2Y2MTQ0YjFhNzdmZjVlYzc2YjMxMjA3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"M-my lord," Dilinur stammered, feeling her throat tighten as she sat down. "Might you prefer to rest instead?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZTc1ZWI2ODdlMzRmZWI5OTliNzk4YWM3N2IyZTNj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"No need to worry. Your chastity will remain intact," Shao replied, standing up from his grand chair and circling around the table towards Dilinur. He grabbed her breasts with both hands, causing her to gasp in shock.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjY2U3MDgwOTNjNjRkOWNhMDNjZjI5ZGIyMzZkMDdi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Shao began massaging her breasts, squeezing them with a possessive ownership that made Dilinur shudder. She did not resist as he undid her robes’ buttons and unlaced her corset, the cool air prickling her naked skin. His hands roamed over her naked body, touching, squeezing, and tracing patterns that sent both chills and heat coursing through her veins. His touch was invasive, and Dilinur felt her dignity dissolve under his leering gaze.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NzE5YjkyOWJlNjRkYmRhZTBlNWU0ZTdiYjUxYTM3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Turn around," he commanded.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMDkxZjQxMzljNTQxNjJiNzUzMzIzMzVmODEwZjM0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">And she did, feeling her cheeks flame as he admired her naked back. He traced the curve of her spine with a cruel finger, leaving a trail of goosebumps in its wake.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZmU1NWM2MzdiMzQwZjdhMzAwMjFiMDA1Y2QzMzk0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Kneel," he then ordered.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNzY4NTQ2NTBjNzQ2YTJhNTQ1MTAyNDU4MTYxODI1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur obeyed, her heart pounding against her ribs. He ran his fingers to her head, unclasping her hairpin then pulling her hair roughly into a makeshift leash which he held onto possessively, the degradation reflecting in his eyes. "Letting Skarn escape, failing to obliterate the Alliance invaders who intrude on our territory. Were it another province, your mistakes would warrant an execution or a tour in the Empress’s Gardens."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZGI0Y2JiNjMwNDRhZmRiMWQxNzU2M2ZkZTdkMTkx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yes, of course," she replied in a tone devoid of emotions. As the Governor’s hand grabbed her, she held herself still, feeling his grip tighten almost painfully as he pulled her close. Her heart raced as he traced the curves of her body. She swallowed hard, feeling like a helpless doll in his grubby hands. He kneaded and pinched the flesh of her breasts without any regard for her comfort.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYzdmNGY1NjNlNjQ2NzI4Y2Q2NTUxNjExODBiMWQ0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yet today, I am feeling generous. Your failures and deficiencies are forgiven." his fingers dug into her nipples, causing sharp pains that shot through her entire body.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNWI3ODVkNTViZDQ5ZDhiYTJlYTcxZmUwYmIyMDdh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She bit down on her lip to stifle the cries that threatened to escape, but they bubbled up inside her anyway - small whimpers that made their way out despite her efforts. "Your mercy honors me…milord."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZGY3ZTNjNmNkMjQzYWNiMjVhNGE1NGM2YmM3ZjRk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Do better next time," he finished, his breath hot on her neck, she could feel him smirking as he continued his assault on her senses.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZTMwMTVkMzUxZTRkM2VhNThjZDBkN2JjMDY0Mjhm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">From behind, his lips moved slowly along her shoulder and neck. She closed her eyes tightly before opening them again when sharp teeth grazed her neck. His tongue invaded her cheek roughly, tasting every inch as his grip on her hair tightened.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMWY1MmRiNjAyYzRmYTk4NDE1NDlhZWFjODFlZjdm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">And then he rose behind her. Through a mirror wall to the side, Dilinur Altai saw him pull out something—his large penis, hard and throbbing. She braced herself for whatever humiliation he would subject her to next.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMWIzMmUzZWNhYjQ5NzBiZDc1NjFhZjQxMGQ0Njlh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">In the minutes that followed, she felt him rubbing his engorged member against the back of her head, his breathing ragged and erratic. Shao's moans grew louder.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YTBiNDFkNmQyNjRjM2ZiYTRjMDc2MWVmZDJmYzhm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Eventually, his manhood traced downward before a hot, sticky liquid began to spurt onto her neck, sending shivers through her body. Shao was cumming—and the sheer volume of his release was both frightening and baffling to Dilinur. How could a man produce so much semen in such a short time?</span></p>
<p class="cnNiODA1YTg5ZDIwZjQyOWVhNjc0ZGIwNWQ5MjU0NmQ5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As the sticky warmth trickled down her spine, Dilinur's mind raced with disgust. She clenched her fists tighter, willing herself not to lash out at him. She knew better than to provoke the ire of someone as powerful as a Governor.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OTE4M2UyZDVmNTRmNjc5Y2Q2MmZkNzA5MzlkYWM2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">For it was him that had helped her rise through the ranks of the Imperium since her graduation.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMjc2OWQ4Y2IxYjQ1Njk5M2JlZmQyMjIxZmMwZDIy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">After what felt like an eternity, Shao's breathing began to return to normal, his grip on her hair loosening.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNzVjODM2OGJmMTQ2NmI4NTgzYWJkYjUzNWI4YThi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Reaching for a box of nanoweave tissue paper on the table, he wiped away the evidence of his perverse pleasure on her neck and torso. Even the tissue's soft fabric offered no solace as it absorbed the white juice on her back.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNzRjNTcxNGIwNzQxMzhhZmRhNmMzNWRjN2YwMTU3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">He stepped back from her, allowing Dilinur to catch her breath as well. She remained kneeling on the cold floor, however, too afraid to move until given permission.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NWQ3NjJkYmJiZjQ2NmNiNDMyM2U1NTUwMjgzMjEw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You may rise," Shao finally said after what seemed like an eternity had passed since he last spoke. His voice was hoarse but satisfied—a predator sated by its prey.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YjUyN2E5MWNlYTQwOTI4M2IwMDEzNjBmNzUxMjMy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dilinur rose shakily to her feet, wincing as she adjusted her robes and corset in an attempt at modesty once more. Her body ached in places she didn't know could hurt; every fiber of her being screamed for revenge against this man.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MjE4Zjg0MDE2NDQ1YzI5MzQ3NjQ4YWEzYWEzM2Qy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">He backed away away suddenly, leaving Dilinur gasping for air and trembling with fear and revulsion. The coldness of the room contrasted sharply with the heat that burned within her now, making it difficult to focus on anything but the persistent trembling of her legs.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNGI1ZjYxMTg3YjQ1MmQ5Y2E3N2FiYzM1M2E0YzVi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She turned to see his hands brush against something cool at his waist - a Medi-Vap - before he brought it up to press against her lips. "Open," he commanded softly, watching intently as she obeyed despite wanting nothing more than to spit in his face right now. The cool mist inside filled her mouth as the minor wounds on her breasts and neck healed, leaving no trace of the violation that had occurred.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDczMGM2ZmE4OTRkODA4MTU5MGE1YjAwZTM3MjQ4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"That should suffice," Shao said with a smirk, releasing her hair from his grasp. "Now, get dressed."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOTQ1ZTU4ZDAyMTQ0NGU5ODBmNGJlOGVkZmU2M2Yz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She rose from the floor, the cool air of the room prickling her bare skin. Picking up her corset with trembling hands, she laced it back up, its tight embrace a familiar, if not comforting, sensation. She slipped into her robes, the fabric heavy and oppressive against her corseted body. With a sigh, she picked up her hairpin from the table, fastening her hair in a neat bun.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTA4MzFlYjY5NzQzZmFiMGVhMDk0MjU5OWRlZDdm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Back to business. The Terra Alliance will most likely be there on Osram. But the Emperor expects results, not excuses. Secure the Moondust Crystal and ensure its integrity, by any means." Shao returned to his throne and sat down, his tone once again filled with merciless determination.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MTg5YTUwYzliOTRkZmU4ZjBhZWIyZDhmOTY5YTY3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"By any means," Dilinur echoed, the phrase tasting like ash upon her tongue as she sat in her chair.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MjAwZTVhNmUzYTQ5ZWM5ZjIxMGMxMDgyMzgwMTll"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Fail me again, and there will be more punishments," he purred, leaning back in his chair and folding the holographic scroll on his desk before handing it to Dilinur. "Take this Holo Scroll with you. You leave at dawn to meet Joon-Seok at the Mount Sword Lake Hotel."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YTNkOGI4MmFhNDQ3ZGJiNDU5NjRmZWI0NzU1Njg3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As she took the Holo Scroll with both hands and rose from her seat, Dilinur couldn't help but cast one final glance at Shao. His smug satisfaction was evident as he turned away from her and stared out of the window at the full Moon hanging in the night sky.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMTI0NDA4MDFjMDQyNTBiYWNlODI2YzAyZDE2ZmJi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Osram awaits, Dinu," he muttered, his voice laced with a dark promise. "With the Moondust Crystal, comes a power not only to dominate those Radi-Mons but also to bring the Five Realms under Imperium's reign. Succeed at this, and we’d both ascend the hierarchy within the Legion, away from this backwater island."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMmM2OTRkNGI3MjRlYzdiZjFkOWQyZmM3NTA0NWI4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Indeed, milord," she whispered before stepping back into the crimson corridor. Were it in her power, she would cast a spell on Shao just to see him squirm. But for now, she would play the game. One day, the right time to have her revenge would come.</span></p>
