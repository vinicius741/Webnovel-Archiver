    Osram Time: 18:17, February 24, 2295
   </span>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Bluestone Rift, Zeeman Crater, Far Side, Osram
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "System functional," Jabari said as he maneuvered his damaged Scarab mech through the narrow rift valley. The missing frontal limb and gashed chassis were reminders of their recent battle with the Jǫtunn, but the mech had held together.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Ume's Gyata hoverbike zipped ahead, her short black hair bobbing slightly with each movement. "This rift seems recent. Odds of someone having created this on their way to the fragment are near 100%."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   In the sky above, Seydou's Isazi cast a reassuring shadow.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Then we're on the right track. If this Crystal is real, someone else would want it, too," Jabari tapped his fingers on the control panel.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The signal's getting stronger," Ume chirped through the comm, "The frequency from up ahead matches the Moondust Crystal's." She pointed toward a small cavern at the base of a lunar spire. "There!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Good work, Ume," Jabari replied, guiding his Scarab forward. As they approached, he noticed the communications becoming more erratic.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The sky rippled with energy, and Celine's voice cut through the comm. "Ologuns, ready your rifles and prepare for landing!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari looked up as Ologun marines in their green fusion-powered exosuits dropped from the Isazi. They landed on the surface, sending up plumes of dust. Celine landed among them with practiced ease.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Form up around the Scarab," she ordered, and the marines fell into position behind Jabari and Ume. "Switch to a near-field channel. This static won't get in our way."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   When they reached the cavern, Ume said, "Based on my visual, these caverns may be too small for mechs and vehicles."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Celine walked beside Jabari's mech. "Power down your Scarab. We proceed on foot from here."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Aye, aye, ma'am," Jabari shut down his Scarab and climbed out of the cockpit. He grabbed his Plasma Rifle and checked the Combat Knife on his belt. Ume parked her hoverbike next to the entrance.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   They nodded to each other before heading inside.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Inside the cavern, the air grew colder. Jabari noticed a pale brown bioluminescent growth pulsing along the walls.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Processed Helionite mixed with Maur saliva. The Radi-Mons were here," he said quietly. He kept his rifle ready as Ume walked beside him. "Stay close."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I will," Ume nodded, her face expressionless.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Ologun marines followed in formation behind them, led by Celine. "Ologuns, safeties off."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The cavern opened up before them, filled with jagged stalagmites and shimmering crystal formations.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Wilhelm's voice came through the comm. "My Anioma's keeping watch while you go under."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Affirmative, thank you," Jabari replied.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Pleasure," Wilhelm answered.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   They entered a large stalactite chamber, big enough for dozens of people. The eerie silence felt oppressive.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Suddenly, growls and hisses erupted around them. Jabari raised his rifle as Bone Fiends and Skuggrs emerged from the shadows. Ume's eyes glowed yellow as she lifted her Plasma Handgun.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Engaging the enemy!" Jabari called out firmly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Ologuns, formation!" Celine ordered. The soldiers raised their Plasma Rifles together.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Bone Fiends growled and gnashed their teeth as they approached. The Skuggrs followed behind.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Fire!" Celine commanded, and plasma bolts lit up the chamber. The Radi-Mons shrieked as they were hit, but more kept coming from behind the stone pillars.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari fired a stream of green plasma bolts at the nearest Fiends, his heart racing.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Please remain still—" Ume moved between the Ologun marines, firing her handgun at the Skuggrs.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Ume, watch out!" Jabari shouted, spotting a Skuggr about to attack her. He quickly fired several shots, taking down the creature before it could reach her.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Celine's voice rang out as she cast a Solar spell.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Kra Nhyira!" The golden energy spread over the warband, healing wounds and giving them renewed strength. The Ologuns fought with fresh determination.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Gradually, the Radi-Mons' numbers dwindled.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "For the Directorate!" Jabari shouted hoarsely. Soon the cavern grew quiet except for the heavy breathing of the soldiers.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari lowered his rifle, his heart still pounding.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Celine approached Ume, who was holding her injured arm while still gripping her handgun.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It never hurts to try," Celine said. Her fingers glowed with healing energy as she spoke in Anansemka. "Susu Firi Owia."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Ume winced but then sighed with relief. "Thank you, Madam Celine."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "As I suspected, you're made using bio-synthetic muscles. My Solar spells seem to work on you," Celine said with a slight smile.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Ume stood still as golden lines flickered in her eyes. "The Moondust Crystal, it's very close!" She pointed toward a shadowed corridor and ran toward it.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Wait, Ume!" Celine called after her.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Ekwensu, Ume!" Jabari ran after her, driven by instinct to protect her.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   At the end of the passage, a blue crystal fragment caught Jabari's eye. It gleamed in the darkness, embedded in the cavern wall.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "There," Ume stopped and pointed.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "We need to be careful," Jabari warned quietly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   They stared at the Moondust fragment. Next to it, blue text was etched in the stone: 'Harald var hér'.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Ignoring the strange writing, Jabari felt his pulse quicken as he looked at the glowing fragment. He gripped his rifle tighter and glanced at Celine, whose expression had become intensely focused.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Extract the fragment. Use your knife to carve it out," she ordered.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari hesitated briefly, then nodded. He put his rifle on his back and took out his Combat Knife. The blade had gold inlays with intricate patterns. The dark green handle with gold accents fit perfectly in his hand.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He began carving around the crystal, working carefully to free it from the wall.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As the fragment fell into his palm, a terrible screech echoed through the cavern. The bioluminescent growth on the walls pulsed erratically.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Hold up..." Celine whispered. "Everyone, form up! Now!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   From the darkness emerged a massive, ink-black octopus-like creature. Its writhing arms were longer than three men laid end to end, and its flesh seemed to absorb the light. Its three amber eyes glowed with intelligence and malice.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Shango's Schlong..." Jabari muttered, pulling Ume behind him. The android trembled against his back.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Hafgrim the Ancient One," Celine said with dread. "Weapons free! Protect the fragment!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <span>
  <br/>
  The narrative has been stolen; if detected on Amazon, report the infringement.
  <br/>
 </span>
 <p>
  <span>
   The black Kraken spoke in a voice like broken glass. "That crystal shard will serve a greater purpose - one beyond your mortal comprehension."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   More Skuggrs emerged from the shadows behind their mistress.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Ologuns! On my mark!" Celine raised her hand, Solar energy crackling around her fingers. "Target the Kraken's minions!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Chaos erupted as the marines opened fire. Plasma bolts cut down several Skuggrs mid-leap. Jabari joined in, each shot lighting up the nightmarish scene.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Ume fired her handgun with trembling hands, picking off targets one by one.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Kraken watched its minions die with apparent amusement. "So easy to slay those that is not your own, isn't it?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   It raised its arms wide and began chanting in Jǫturmál. "Hugr þinn, dýpt svefns!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The spell hit Celine. She staggered and clutched her head, screaming.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Celine!" Jabari moved toward her, but Ume grabbed his arm.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Something's wrong with her bio-readings," the android said urgently. "Her neural patterns are being overwritten!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   When Celine straightened up, her eyes glowed unnaturally. She turned her Solar powers against her own troops, chanting, "Anyan Kaw-naw-mu!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The first Ologun was consumed by golden fire before he could cry out.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Dr. Kamara, please!" Another marine begged before being struck down.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari watched in horror as their commander systematically killed her own people.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Kraken seemed pleased, its arms writhing in celebration. "Most amusing. Maridians have proven easier to defeat than I presumed."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Bo-oh-deh Ntwamudua!" A new voice boomed, and a wall of violet energy appeared between Celine and her remaining soldiers.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari turned to see a Maridian man stride from the shadows, his eyes glowing with psionic power. The newcomer wore elegant emerald and gold ceremonial clothes that seemed almost regal, though slightly damaged from battle. His glossy black hair framed his face, and his eyes glittered with purple energy as he grinned.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Kraken stopped moving, its amber eyes fixing on the newcomer. "The Prince of Ivory Coast!" it rasped. "Still meddling in affairs beyond your comprehension, Laurent?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Hunting funny-sounding artifacts for Skarn again, Hafgrim?" Laurent replied casually. "Always giving you the hard jobs, isn't he?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Little Laurent," The Kraken rose to its full height, arms spread wide. "The Crystal belongs to the Fenris Horde. Your glibess shall not save you."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Meanwhile, Celine continued moving robotically, preparing another Solar spell. Three Ologuns lay dead or dying, their exosuits smoking from her attacks.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Jabari, is it? Our new arrival," Laurent said without taking his eyes off Hafgrim. "Remember your training? Every Kraken has a weakness - a spot the DSC's archives speak of. Ring any bells?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari suddenly understood - the mouth beneath the arms. The vulnerable spot that even Krakens couldn't protect. But reaching it would be difficult.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Your pets learn nothing," Hafgrim screeched with amusement. "The Crystal belongs to my great Primarch Skarn, as you will witness!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   But as the Kraken gloated, it rose slightly with its arms spread wide. An opening.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari didn't hesitate. He sprinted forward as Laurent cast another spell, drawing Hafgrim's attention upward with crackling violet energy.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Three steps. Two. One.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Time seemed to slow as Jabari dove. He brought up his Plasma Rifle and pulled the trigger.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The weapon fired a barrage of green bolts directly into the Kraken's mouth. Each hit drew an unholy shriek from Hafgrim, its arms thrashing wildly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Insolent worm!" Its screech of pain shook loose stones from the ceiling. A massive arm whipped toward Jabari, but he was already rolling away to safety.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Again!" Laurent commanded, and Jabari fired another burst. Hafgrim recoiled further, retreating from the assault.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "This means nothing," Hafgrim said with hatred as it withdrew into the shadows. "When the Fenris strikes again, your moon will drown in darkness."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As the Kraken left, Celine stumbled. Laurent caught her before she collapsed.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Ayaresa!" Laurent chanted as his hands glowed with violet energy, breaking Hafgrim's control.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Celine's eyes cleared, and she immediately noticed her fallen soldiers. She stiffened in Laurent's arms.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It wasn't you, madam," Jabari said firmly, keeping his rifle aimed at the shadows. "It was the Kraken."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She blinked, focusing on Laurent. Recognition and disbelief crossed her face.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "P-p-prince Laurent?" Celine whispered. "How are you—" She winced and touched her temple. "Seydou lost contact with you weeks ago. We thought—"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That I'd met my end?" Laurent smiled wryly. "I decided it was easier to track down this fragment on my own than to bother Chairman Kofi with the details."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Chairman and his Oligarchs have questions!" Celine tried to stand straight but faltered. "Suddenly embarking on this mission without informing your underlings...it's not the first time you've done so!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Ah, quite right," Laurent adjusted the amulet at his throat. "Maybe I should apply for business leave next time?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Celine touched her earpiece. "Seydou, Wilhelm - you won't believe who we've found. Prince Laurent is here, alive and well."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The comm exploded with exclamations.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "LAURENT?!" Seydou's voice cracked with shock. "Is this some kind of joke, Celine? Because if it is—"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It's no joke," Celine confirmed. "He's standing right in front of me."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Good heavens!" Wilhelm's normally composed voice wavered. "We've been searching bloody everywhere! Two weeks without a word!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "May I?" Laurent gestured to Celine's earpiece. She nodded and handed it to him.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Hello, my friends," Laurent spoke warmly. "Yes, it's really me. Still breathing and still causing trouble."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Chairman was about to declare you MIA!" Seydou exclaimed. "What happened? Where have you been?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "A long story, best told in person," Laurent replied. "This fragment required…discretion. I'd hate to have Chairman Kofi demand an update on an hourly basis."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Well, you're not alone anymore, sir," Wilhelm declared. "And you're explaining everything once we're back at Tumi!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "With pleasure," Laurent handed back the earpiece with a slight bow. "And perhaps over something stronger than water rations, hmm?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   After a moment of silence, Seydou remembered protocol. "Right, right—status report! Do you have the fragment? Is everyone alright?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Ume appeared beside Jabari. "No signs of Hafgrim or additional Radi-Mons. But my sensors indicate the cavern's structural integrity was compromised during the battle."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Laurent looked at Ume, his brow furrowing slightly. "And what do we have here? A ZenFusion model, if I'm not mistaken."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "This is Ume," Jabari said, stepping closer to her protectively. "She's an android, but...different. We recovered her from an Imperial facility on Earth. She's helping us track the Crystal fragments."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Celine nodded. "U6-M9 is with us, Laurent. Her data was crucial to finding this shard."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Laurent studied Ume briefly, then nodded. "Interesting times indeed." His expression grew serious as he looked at the fallen Ologuns. "I see three who've fallen here. I recognize Nyathi from the Cape Coast training grounds."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "And we lost Abaan in the field," Celine added steadily. "Nyathi, Makeba, and Khalid — good soldiers all. They died for something of true importance."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Laurent nodded solemnly. "Their sacrifice will be remembered."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Celine straightened, drawing strength from Laurent's words. "Hafgrim's control was... overwhelming. But I felt you all fighting for me." She looked at Jabari with new respect. "Especially you, Lieutenant. Your actions were exemplary."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I was just doing my duty, ma'am," Jabari replied, the crystal fragment pulsing in his pocket.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Seydou's voice crackled through their comms. "Hello? Hello? Is anyone there? The interference is clearing! Celine? Jabari? Anyone?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "We're here, Seydou," Celine responded. "Mission accomplished. We have the fragment."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You have it?" Seydou's excited voice came through. "That's amazing! Absolutely amazing! The first Moondust Crystal fragment recovered by humans in...well, maybe ever! I'm telling Outpost Tumi now. They'll welcome us like heroes!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Control yourself, Seydou," Celine said, though she sounded slightly amused. "We've lost many good soldiers who gave their lives for this mission."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A moment of silence followed.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Of course, they will be honored," Seydou replied solemnly. "Their sacrifice won't be forgotten."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Indeed they won't," Laurent agreed, placing a hand on Celine's shoulder. "But they would also want us to recognize what we've achieved here. The Directorate now possesses what both the Imperium and Alliance have failed to secure."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "He's right," Wilhelm added through the comm. "I've been monitoring communications. There's no chatter about any other faction having a piece of this mythical crystal. We're the first, and that's worth celebrating."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jabari looked at the fragment in his pocket, then at Ume. "What do you think this thing can do?" he asked quietly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Unknown," she replied. "But based on its resonance pattern, its potential is... significant."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "We should return to Outpost Tumi immediately," Celine said, focusing back on the mission. "We need to secure the fragment and prepare our report to Chairman Kofi."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "And perhaps," Wilhelm suggested, "a small recognition of our accomplishment might be in order. I've already radioed ahead to Tumi. They're quite eager to welcome the heroes who secured the Crystal fragment."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Laurent laughed warmly. "Always thinking of morale, aren't you, Wilhelm? But he's not wrong," he added to Celine. "The team deserves acknowledgment for what they've achieved today."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Celine hesitated, then nodded. "Agreed. We'll honor our fallen properly, but we'll also recognize this historic achievement." She turned to the remaining Ologuns. "Prepare to transport our brothers back to the surface. They return home with honor."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As they gathered their fallen comrades, Jabari felt the weight of the crystal shard in his pocket. Despite their losses, they had accomplished something unprecedented. He felt a surge of pride as he looked at Ume, who gave him a small smile.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You did well," Laurent said, walking beside him as they headed back through the cavern. "Your instincts against Hafgrim were impressive. The Kimaris Warband chose wisely when they selected you."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Thank you, sir," Jabari replied, standing a bit straighter. "Though I'm still learning."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Aren't we all?" Laurent's eyes twinkled. "Even after decades of fighting these abominations, they still find ways to surprise me."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As they emerged from the cavern into Osram's eternal night, the Isazi dropship hovered above, a welcome sight. For the first time since landing on the lunar surface, Jabari felt something beyond duty or fear. The Moondust Crystal fragment pulsed quietly in his pocket.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Whatever Hafgrim had planned, they had denied her this piece of the puzzle. For now, at least, that was enough.
  </span>
 </p>
