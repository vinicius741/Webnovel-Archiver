   "Now feed power into it – slowly! – no, stop, you'll-" Kaelan sighed as yet again the small flame cupped in Vertigo's hands exploded from a gentle candle flicker to an out-of-control blaze. He yelped, more out of surprise than pain, and shook his hands vigorously as the fire dissipated into wisps of smoke. "You need to focus, dammit! Stop getting distracted!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo glared at her from underneath his dark bangs, shoulders hunched defensively. "Then stop distracting me!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "If you would just listen..." She sighed and ran a hand through her silver hair, pushing it back from her face in frustration. The campfire flickered beside him, as if mocking him. "Do it again."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He sat back on his heels, feeling mutinous. His palms still tingled from the last attempt, and sweat beaded on his forehead despite the cool breeze. "We've done this at least fifty times already!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Make it fifty-one."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo grumbled under his breath but extended his hands again, palms up. Concentrating, he summoned a tiny flame, a perfect sphere no larger than a marble hovering just above his skin. For several seconds, he maintained it, his breathing measured and controlled.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan nodded slightly, the closest thing to approval she'd shown all day. "Good. Now-"
  </span>
  <span>
   Her brow furrowed suddenly and her gaze went distant, silver eyes unfocused. A low hiss escaped her lips.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What?" Vertigo asked, the flame flickering with his broken concentration.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Nothing." A muscle in her jaw jumped as she opened her eyes, but her posture had changed imperceptibly, like a predator catching a scent.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What?" he insisted, letting the flame die as he glared at her. "You found something. What is it?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That bastard I was hunting the night you three stumbled in and messed it all up," she muttered, her head tilting slightly as though listening to something beyond mortal hearing. "He's close by. I can feel it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As if in confirmation, the low drone of engines reached his ears, rumbling from somewhere beyond the tree line. It sounded like a convoy of military-style trucks, the heavy growl of diesel engines cutting through the quiet. A long moment passed as they both listened to the approaching vehicles.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo's hand moved instinctively to his massive sword, fingers wrapping around the familiar hilt. "Well, what are we waiting for?" he asked cheerfully. "Let's go get him."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan's mouth dropped open slightly, genuine surprise disrupting her usually controlled expression. "No. No, no, and no. That is a
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    terrible
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   idea. You are not coming on a hunt with me."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Why not?" he demanded, eyes narrowing as he stood, already adjusting his weapon's harness.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You've never been up against a demon before," she said, her voice low and intense. "You have no idea what you're up against, and you would probably only just get in the way or get yourself dead."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Come on, if I have to spend the entire time sitting out here making stupid little lights and... and doing aura shit, I'm going to lose my damn mind." He gestured wildly at their training spot. "I swear to meditate as much as you want and do all the pretty lights you tell me to and... all that other shit if we can just go do something that isn't boring as hell!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan hesitated, her eyes tracking toward the sound of engines. He could tell that the idea was appealing to her; she wanted to fight. The energy around her was already shifting, the air crackling faintly with suppressed power. Seeing her pause, he pushed it a little further.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I thought you were some kind of mighty demon hunter," he taunted, crossing his arms. "You got stage fright or something?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Her silver eyes flashed dangerously. "I'm not going to let you manipulate me into it," she snapped, though the tension in her shoulders betrayed her eagerness for combat. "I'm half tempted to take you in just so you get your idiotic ass killed."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Getting killed would be more fun than this," he muttered, kicking at the dirt.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Fine!" She rose in one fluid motion and glared at him, jaw set in determination. "But you do exactly what I say, exactly when I say it, no fighting or whining, even if you think you know better. You stay out of the fighting unless and until I tell you where to be and what to do." She jabbed a finger at his chest. "Those are the terms. Take them, or spend all your time meditating anyway."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He shut his mouth on his sarcastic response, weighing his options for only a second before nodding curtly. "Fine."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Good." Kaelan turned away, rolling her shoulders as if loosening for combat. "Let's go." She took off in the direction of the engine noises, moving with preternatural grace through the underbrush.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo growled to himself and sprinted after her, his longer legs working to keep pace. Even with his enhanced speed, he had to push himself to keep up with her. Five vehicles came into view in the distance, their bright white headlamps cutting through the gathering dusk, dust billowing behind them like dirty halos.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The lead vehicle sputtered to a halt as its headlights washed over Kaelan and Vertigo standing in the middle of the road. The others fanned out in a practiced maneuver, creating a wide circle that surrounded them. Dust curled through the light beams, the only thing breaking the tense stillness the idling rumble of engines.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A man dressed in black leather and dented armor dropped from one of the topless trucks and strode forward toward Kaelan, a cocky smirk on his face. His eyes glinted an unnatural red in the fading light, and there was something off about his movements - too fluid, too predatory to be fully human. Vertigo felt a chill run down his spine as he recognized what – who – this really was. Before, Vertigo would have assumed he was a Talent. Now, he knew better. A small part of his mind whispered,
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    This is what you are, too. Part of this. Kin to this thing.
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   The thought made his stomach clench uncomfortably. Now he was facing what Commander had told him was his heritage, and there was no going back to blissful ignorance.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What are you doing out here all by yourself, sweetheart?" he called, voice carrying a strange resonance that made Vertigo's skin crawl. The demon's gaze flicked dismissively to Vertigo. "And with such a pet, no less."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo's muscles tensed, ready to lunge forward, but Kaelan's hand shot out to stop him. Her only response to the taunt was to raise her right fist high above her head in a deliberate gesture of challenge. Lightning crackled down the length of her arm, starting at her fingertips and flowing to her shoulder in a mesmerizing display of power. Bright blue sparks snapped off the end of the dagger she now held in her left hand, illuminating her face from below.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   It was an impressive display, and as a tactic Vertigo had to admit it was probably effective at making everyone else in those cars shit their pants. He certainly felt a twinge of unease, and she was supposedly on his side.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You wanna do it rough, huh? Okay then." The demon's smile widened, revealing teeth that were just slightly too sharp. In response, he drew a short, nasty-looking blade. He raised his other fist and a swelling dark ball of nothingness enveloped it, pure absence that hurt Vertigo's eyes to look at directly. "Listen up, men!" he bellowed, pointing the sword at Vertigo. "The one who kills this loser over here gets first crack at the sweet little lady!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dense blackness dropped over Vertigo and Kaelan like a smothering blanket, cutting off all light. In the sudden darkness, Vertigo could hear boots hitting the ground and weapons being readied, too many to count.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Faceless figures poured out of the vehicles, the advantage in numbers and Kaelan's presumed distraction giving them confidence. Vertigo growled and slashed out with his sword in a wide arc, creating a buffer zone between himself and the approaching enemies. Gunfire erupted from the trucks, muzzle flashes illuminating twisted faces in strobelike bursts.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Out of reflex, Vertigo raised his massive sword lengthwise as a shield, though the rational part of his mind knew that body armor or no, he was going to end up full of holes-
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   His brain screeched to a halt as something impossible happened. A faint blue-white shimmer appeared in the air around him, and the bullets slowed down as they approached, as if moving through thick syrup. Most of them dropped out of the air before ever reaching him, their momentum somehow stolen. A few whizzed past his face, but slowly enough that he could track them as they went, like lazy insects rather than deadly projectiles.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A quick glance toward Kaelan showed her left hand extended toward him, fingers splayed, even as she focused most of her attention on the demon. She had created some kind of protective field around him without breaking stride in her own fight. The realization that she was actively shielding him while engaged in combat herself was both humbling and irritating.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <span>
    Quit gaping, idiot,
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   his brain suggested, and his body followed, bringing the sword up in a diagonal two-handed uppercut that caught the nearest attacker across the chest. Flashes of lightning from behind him cut through the dark zone, illuminating the scene in harsh blue-white strobes. Men fell away from his blade, dead or wounded, or just trying to get out of the way of the massive steel. A full-speed bullet from the truck-mounted heavy gun
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    pinged
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   off his blade as he stepped forward, and he quickly retreated back into Kaelan's protective field, fending off melee weapons from those brave or stupid enough to close with him.
  </span>
  <span>
   Against these opponents, he was more than competent, and the old familiar exhilaration of combat took over as he slashed and struck, scattering them before him like leaves in the wind. Vertigo made short work of the melee fighters; the gunmen fell silent, as though daring him to step outside the strange shield that seemed to be protecting him.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A massive burst of light exploded behind him as the unnatural darkness fell away, and he chanced a look over his shoulder. The gunners seemed as transfixed as he was, none of them firing, all eyes drawn to the spectacle unfolding at the center of their makeshift arena. Kaelan and the demon were... dancing? That was really the only word he could come up with for what it looked like as they darted in and out, trading blows with both blade and magic at speeds that defied human capability. Where he used his brute strength in combat, Kaelan favored speed and agility. When the demon struck out with darkness, she was simply not there, moving like smoke between raindrops. Darkness swallowed electricity, and lightning drove the shadows out of existence before they could reach their target.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Their speed was simply astronomical; he had trouble following the fight as they wove in and out of the headlights, stripes of light and shadow intermingling into glimpses of an arm, a glittering blade, trailing long pale hair. Flashes of lightning illuminated the combatants sporadically as Kaelan landed gracefully on the hood of a truck with the ball of one foot and in the next instant had sprung into the air, the demon leaping to brace himself on another truck with one foot on the windshield. They passed in midair, blades meeting in a shower of sparks, and he couldn't tell if either had scored a hit.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   An explosion of light in the center of the ring of vehicles had him diving for cover before he'd even registered what was happening.
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    If the bastards had grenades, why hadn't they used them earlier?
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   he thought wildly, rolling behind the cover of a truck's wheel.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   But it wasn't a grenade. As the spots cleared from his vision, Vertigo saw another woman standing in the circle, her entire body shedding a soft golden glow. Her olive-toned skin was almost iridescent, and she was dressed in flowing white garments that seemed to float around her despite the still air. Curly electric blue hair was tied into a low ponytail, and in her hands she held a long-bladed golden polearm, a glaive or spear of some sort with intricate etchings along its length.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Crouched partway beside one of the vehicles, Vertigo tensed, his hands tightening around the hilt of his weapon. Was this another demon? Some new threat?
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Proving him wrong, the woman dove into the fight on Kaelan's side, the demon suddenly facing two on one. The battlefield lit up as the newcomer's light drove all the shadows out of existence, turning night into a harsh, unnatural day. An engine's roar distracted him briefly; the remaining bandits had apparently decided that enough was enough. Two of the trucks sped away as fast as they could go, tires throwing up tails of dust. He let them go, keeping a wary eye on the supernatural combat unfolding before him.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan's face remained impassive; he didn't even know if she was capable of looking surprised. The two women worked together smoothly but impersonally, not the teamwork of people who were used to fighting together but more like students who had trained under the same teacher. Their movements complemented each other – where Kaelan struck with lightning precision, the newcomer flowed like water, both inexorable and impossible to grasp.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan delivered a vicious stab and brutal twist of her knife. The demon staggered and spat a glob of black blood at her, a sneer still fixed on his face despite the wound. The other woman - angel, Vertigo supposed - whipped her spear around and caught the demon in the back of the legs with the shaft. The demon fell to his knees with a roar of rage.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan kicked him in the face with ruthless efficiency and snapped her foot back just in time to avoid the cascade of searing light that poured from the spear's tip. Vertigo shielded his eyes with his arm but couldn't shut out the agonizing scream that rang out before cutting off in a choked sound. The light continued even after that, brighter than the sun, washing out all color and detail from the world. After what seemed like an eternity it finally faded and died.
  </span>
 </p>
 <span>
  <br/>
  Stolen from Royal Road, this story should be reported if encountered on Amazon.
  <br/>
 </span>
 <p>
  <span>
   All that was left where the demon had been was a charred, smoking skeleton, its rib cage curling in on itself.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Instinct told Vertigo that he should stay where he was; there was still a strange tension in the air, an electric feeling of unfinished business. Kaelan and the newcomer faced off over the remains of the dead demon. Neither of them put their weapons away, both standing with the coiled readiness of predators assessing each other.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Kaelan," the blue-haired woman greeted. Her voice was high and sweet but somehow unnerving, like honey laced with something bitter.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Jaeli," Kaelan responded coolly. Next to the other angel she sounded flat and uninterested, but Vertigo could see the tension in her shoulders.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What a pleasure running into you here." Jaeli's smile didn't reach her eyes. "I was hunting a little fledgling when I felt you fighting. It seems you've missed one, though." She didn't spare a glance for Vertigo but he felt her attention on him regardless, a cold pressure that sent a shiver through him. Whereas Kaelan had been all hot temper facing him for the first time, this angel was just... nothing. It was like he was a bug for her to squash, beneath even contempt.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "This one's with me," Kaelan said, her voice hard.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jaeli's eyebrows rose. "With you? My, how things change." She twirled her spear casually, the golden weapon leaving trails of light in the air. "Consorting with half-breeds?" She clicked her tongue disapprovingly. "The Council would be most interested to hear about this."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    Vathirar na ehkthir,
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   " Kaelan replied evenly. "And you too if you're thinking about causing trouble."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jaeli laughed, the sound like breaking glass. "Always so dramatic, Kaelan. I'm not here for you or your... pet. I was just passing through." Her gaze finally settled on Vertigo, and he felt a chill run through him at the empty, cold calculation in her eyes. "Though I must admit, he looks unusually strong for his kind."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "He's none of your concern," Kaelan said firmly, taking a step to place herself more directly between them.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Jaeli's smile widened. "If you say so." She turned away, her spear dissolving into motes of light that scattered on the breeze. Over her shoulder, she added, "Oh, and Sakurai sends his regards. He’s looking forward to seeing you soon."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   With that, she walked away, her form somehow blurring at the edges until she seemed to fade into the darkness beyond the vehicles' headlights. For several long moments, neither Kaelan nor Vertigo moved, the only sound the idle rumble of the remaining trucks.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan's shoulders finally relaxed a fraction, and she turned to face Vertigo, sheathing her daggers with practiced efficiency. Her expression was closed off, but he could see calculation in her silver eyes. She looked up at him, her voice cold. "We've got to go. It's not safe here."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Aren't you going to tell me what the fuck is going on?" Vertigo demanded, gesturing at the skeletal remains and the spot where Jaeli had disappeared. "Who was that?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "She might not have been alone, or someone might have been paying attention," Kaelan snapped. "And if we don't leave right now, we'll be dealing with more of the same. Move your ass!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Recognizing the genuine urgency in her tone, Vertigo bit back further questions. Together they approached one of the abandoned trucks, Kaelan checking it over with practiced efficiency before nodding for him to get in. The keys were still in the ignition, and the engine turned over with a throaty rumble when Vertigo twisted them.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Just drive," Kaelan said, scanning the darkness around them as she slid into the passenger seat. "As fast as this thing will go."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo complied, slamming the truck into gear and accelerating away from the improvised battlefield. The headlights cut through the gathering darkness, illuminating the empty road ahead. For several miles, they drove in tense silence, Kaelan constantly checking behind them for pursuit.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Only when they were well clear of the area did she relax fractionally, leaning back in her seat with a small sigh.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Alright," Vertigo said, his knuckles white on the steering wheel. "We're away. Now tell me what the hell that was all about."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan was quiet for a long moment, staring out at the darkness beyond the headlights. When she finally spoke, her voice was uncharacteristically hesitant. "Her name is Jaeli, Angel of Light. She works for a faction led by an angel named Kaldi." She rubbed her temples as if fighting a headache. "It's... complicated. The angelic realm is in the middle of what you might call a civil war."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "A civil war?" Vertigo repeated, glancing at her skeptically. "Angels fighting angels?" Vertigo contemplated this for a moment, and suddenly put two and two together. "Is that what Commander promised to help you with? You think he can do something for you?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yes. Kaldi is trying to activate an artifact called the Lodestone. She wants to use it to destroy the mortal realm, ending the eternal conflict with demons." Kaelan's voice was flat, emotionless, as though reciting facts from a textbook. “That means you, and your friends, everyone.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A chill gripped him. “Um, shouldn’t you be stopping that?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan sighed. “She needs to unlock the Lodestone first. It’s rumored that it’s the focus stone used by Weaver herself in creating the realms, and using it requires consensus. Each angel needs to give it some of their essence, and she's willing to use any methods necessary to get it. She’s not quite there yet, but she’s finished crafting the destruction ritual.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “So…” His hands tightened on the steering wheel. “We’re all gonna die.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   “Not die,” she corrected. “Just wiped out of existence.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo rolled his eyes. “Right, because that’s so much better. So how exactly can Commander help you with this?”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Commander has a... surprising amount of resources," she repeated, a hint of irritation creeping into her voice. "I agreed to help him in exchange for whatever he can bring to the table. Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this for anything less than a desperate situation."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yeah, I get it, I'm the scum of the earth," he growled, accelerating aggressively around a curve in the road. "I can't help the way I was born, you know."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Of course you can't." She sounded almost surprised by his vehemence.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Then what the fuck is your problem?" Vertigo pounded the steering wheel with his palm, his frustration boiling over. "You've been treating me like garbage since the moment we met!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan turned to look directly at him, her silver eyes glinting intensely in the dim light. "I've seen too many half-breeds let their power go to their head, or worse, let their power take control and drive them berserk. I can't trust any of you." Her voice dropped lower, almost a whisper. "You've felt it, haven't you? That itch in the back of your head telling you to let go, surrender to destruction?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo swallowed uncomfortably, his anger faltering. She had described the sensation perfectly - that whisper he sometimes heard in moments of rage or pain, urging him to unleash everything, damn the consequences. The voice he fought to ignore. He found he had no response.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   They drove in silence for nearly an hour, the landscape gradually changing from scrubland to the outskirts of civilization. Vertigo complained under his breath about her cryptic answers as they drove, growing increasingly frustrated with each mile of silence. He might as well have been talking to the dashboard for all the response he got.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Abandoned buildings began to appear along the roadside, the skeletal remains of what had once been neighborhoods before the Apocalypse. The core of Etienne was only a small fraction of what this city had once been. When they finally reached the outskirts of the city, Kaelan abruptly instructed him to stop. The urban ruins sprawled around them, abandoned and falling apart, only a few buildings standing amid a sea of rubble. The place had been looted for anything valuable or useful long ago.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Pull over there," she directed, pointing to a particularly tall structure that still had most of its walls intact. "We'll stop for the night."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo guided the truck into what had once been a parking garage, cutting the engine. The sudden silence was almost oppressive after the constant rumble of the road. "You're not worried about being followed?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "We've put enough distance between us and them," Kaelan said, though her eyes continued to scan their surroundings warily. "And I'll set wards."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   They made their way into the building, a former office tower that had somehow withstood both the ravages of the Apocalypse and the subsequent centuries of neglect. Most of the windows were long gone, and the wind whistled through empty frames as they climbed the stairs to the upper floors. Vertigo's legs burned with the exertion after a day of combat and driving, but he'd be damned if he'd complain while she strode ahead without apparent fatigue.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   For some reason, Kaelan seemed determined to reach the very top of the building, leading them to the former penthouse level with its sweeping views of the ruined city. The place had been stripped, but the structure itself seemed sound enough despite the gaps in the ceiling and walls.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Stay here," she said abruptly, moving toward a half-collapsed section where the roof had partially given way. "I'm going to check our surroundings."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Without waiting for a response, she pulled herself up through the gap and onto what remained of the roof, displaying an agility that reminded Vertigo she wasn't human. Curious and slightly annoyed at being ordered around like a dog, he moved to the nearest window frame to keep an eye on her.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   From his vantage point, he could see Kaelan perched on the very top of a partially collapsed wall, balancing with preternatural grace on the narrow surface. The sunrise painted the ruins in shades of gold and crimson behind her, her silver hair catching the light like polished metal. But off to the north, an ominous dark mass of clouds loomed, moving against the prevailing winds at an unnatural speed.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo frowned, watching the sky darken with concerning rapidity. The wind picked up, whistling through the broken windows and sending crumbling papers skittering across the floor. Something about this felt wrong; weather patterns in the wasteland were unpredictable at best, but this storm was forming too quickly, too purposefully. The hair on his arms stood on end as the air took on a charged quality that made his teeth ache.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan remained on her perch, seemingly unconcerned as the clouds rushed in and the sky blackened around her. Her hair whipped around her face in the strengthening wind, and Vertigo could see her raise her hands to rake it back. Even from this distance, he caught her reaction as the first raindrops hit; not surprise or dismay, but something that looked bizarrely like delight.
  </span>

   Within seconds, the skies opened up into a torrential downpour. Vertigo pulled back from the window as water began to sheet through the opening, but he could still see Kaelan, now soaked to the skin, tilting her face up toward the storm with her arms outstretched. A flash of lightning illuminated her silhouette, followed almost instantly by a crash of thunder that shook the building to its foundations.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He heard her laugh, a wild sound of pure exhilaration that carried even over the howling wind. She called out to the storm as if greeting an old friend, her voice melding with the thunder in a way that raised the hair on the back of his neck.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Are you crazy?" he shouted, stepping through the broken window frame onto a section of roof that offered some degree of cover. "Get down from there! You'll get killed!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She either didn't hear him or chose to ignore him, her attention fixed on the roiling sky above. Lightning forked through the clouds with increasing frequency, striking closer and closer to the building. Any sane person would be seeking shelter, not standing on the highest point for miles around like a human lightning rod.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Hey! Kaelan!" he called again, raising his voice over the storm. "Are you listening to me?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She glanced down at her name, and even through the rain he could see a strange luminescence in her eyes, like silver coins catching moonlight. For a moment, she seemed about to respond, but then another bolt of lightning split the sky directly overhead, the thunder so immediate and deafening that Vertigo instinctively ducked. When he looked up again, he froze in horror.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A massive bolt of lightning had struck Kaelan directly, engulfing her in blinding white-blue energy. His shout of alarm was lost in the thunder as she convulsed, still somehow maintaining her balance on the narrow beam. The electricity seemed to flow through her rather than dissipate, coruscating over her skin in intricate patterns that reminded him unsettlingly of veins.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Fuck!" he yelled. "This is nuts!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He started forward, not sure what he could possibly do but unwilling to just watch her die, when another flash blinded him momentarily. When his vision cleared, he could see her on her knees on the beam, clutching at the stone, apparently still alive. A soft glow emanated from her skin, and tiny arcs of electricity jumped between her fingertips.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   For several long moments, she remained motionless except for the heaving of her chest as she took deep, ragged breaths. Then, to Vertigo's astonishment, she stood up, swayed slightly - and stepped off the beam into empty air.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   His heart lurched, but instead of plummeting to the ground, she floated downward like a feather caught in a gentle breeze, touching down lightly on the same section of roof where he stood. Close up, the transformation was even more startling. Her hair had bleached to a pure, metallic silver that seemed to glow from within. Her skin radiated a faint luminescence, and when she moved, small crackles of electricity followed her like static.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Reflexively, he grabbed her by the shoulders. "What the fuck were you thinking?" he demanded, rain streaming down his face and pooling at his feet.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She flinched away from his touch with a small gasp. "I really have to teach you to keep that under control," she murmured, her voice sounding distant and dreamy.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He realized his hands were unnaturally warm, wisps of steam rising where the rain hit his skin – his agitation had triggered his fire affinity without him even noticing. Vertigo shook her anyway, past caring about her comfort. "You could have been killed, idiot!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It's sweet to know you were so worried about me.”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo gaped at her, then dropped his hands away as if burned. "I thought you were dead! What the fuck was I gonna tell Commander? 'You climbed up a post and next minute you get zapped by lightning because you're too fucking stupid to come in out of the rain?'"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She shook her head, sending a spray of silvery water droplets in all directions. "I was never in any danger, stupid. I'm lightning affiliated. That means I can recharge from electricity." She held up one hand, showing him the little arcs of electricity still dancing between her fingers. "I just usually don't do it in so... drastic... a manner."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo stared at her for a long moment, relief transforming rapidly into frustration as he processed what she was saying. "I didn't know that! How am I supposed to know anything if you don't tell me?" He threw his hands up in exasperation, rain streaming down his face and dripping from his sodden hair. "You act so high and mighty, like you're so far above me, and maybe you are, but maybe I wouldn't be so far beneath you if you'd just bother to fucking
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    explain
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   something once in a while!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Her lips pressed together, the otherworldly calm that had surrounded her moments before disappearing as irritation took its place. "I don't have the time to explain every tiny, obvious thing to you as if you were a child! You're not my novice, and I'm not your teacher."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Fine!" Vertigo shoved her away, water cascading from his sodden cloak. "Next time I'll let you stay here and get soaking wet, or get your ass fried by the lightning. Enjoy your random thunderstorm." He turned and stalked back inside, his boots squelching with every angry step.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Once inside, he stripped off his cloak and shook it out viciously, sending water spraying across the already damp floor. His heart was still pounding and his hands trembled slightly, which he disguised by busying himself with attempting to start a small fire.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   After several minutes of working with some old newspapers and a few broken furniture pieces, he managed to coax a small flame to life. The warmth was a welcome contrast to his soaked clothing. Kaelan still hadn't come inside, and he wasn't about to go check on her again. If she wanted to stay out there getting rained on, that was her problem.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Just as he had the thought, the door to the roof slammed open. Kaelan stormed in, shedding water and sparks everywhere, her expression intense. Vertigo looked up from his fire, still irritated but immediately alert at her changed demeanor.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "We need to be on our guard," she informed him, her voice sharp with urgency. "There's another angel in the city and I don't recognize them."
  </span>
