<p class="cnNiOThlYTk0OTMwNTQwYTg5MzljZmZlMDBjMzA5OTdj"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Things might get a bit dicey this time.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnMzMzM5NjVmNDAyMTQ2NTRhMzBkOTkzZWE0M2QyODM4"><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the thought making rounds in my mind as we took our first snow-laden steps into the old house. The faint winter light trickled in through the rips in the translucent paper panes covering the windows, giving the dilapidated hallway a somber atmosphere. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiMjlhNDJjYzE1NDQzMjlhNzJkYzc5MTU0NDU3NDcy"><span style="font-weight: 400">After trekking through a seasonally dead forest covered by last night’s snowfall, even the smallest relief from the biting cold was welcoming. Still, the broken windows lining the tight hallway and the smell of old, moldy wood reminded me of just how preposterous this situation was.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MGZkYjk1NzA3MDQ5YzBiMTU4Yjc5MGFlMDRiM2Mw"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s so cold. My feet hurt. This place is falling apart. Ah, I want to go home so bad.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnM4ZjZjNzYzNTA5YzQ4MzFhYTFkYmNkZjE1YThjNTdk"><span style="font-weight: 400">In stark contrast to my disposition, the short girl right in front of me seemed to be in particularly high spirits. With each confident step she took, the ruined building creaked in response, as if complaining about the intruders.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MDEwMDdlNjA4MjRjNjViMDg0YjFmMjAyZGU2M2I0"><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought about how my life decisions led to this situation, and a long-overdue sigh escaped my mouth.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNmY5NmNlNzkxZTQ1YmRhN2M5ODJiYjYwYmU3M2M5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What am I even doing here?” I asked in a hushed voice.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMTU2NmJmMTA4MDRjMjViMzcwZTViOWQ3MzM5NGZm"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a rhetorical question, but the girl had heard me somehow, and was taking my words at face value. She stopped dead in her tracks and turned back to face me with a frown.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNDBmOGRlN2VmYTQxNDc4NDJkOTk3ODljM2U4YWQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You were the one you insisted on coming, remember? I would have been just fine on my own.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiY2E5MTE1Y2Q1ZjRhZDJhODVmNGY1NDg2ZDFlZmRk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You really thought I’d let you come to this haunted house alone? You might just get yourself killed by one of those ghosts you’re hunting.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMDczZTU1YzhiMzQxZjBiZGNjZDJiOTc5OWMwNjk2"><span style="font-weight: 400">My words clearly hit a nerve with her.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTdkNWZmNGE3ZDRkOTY4N2ZmMjc4NzIwZTViOWU3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’re not here for the ghosts. Or did you forget everything I told you?</span></p>
<p class="cnMyN2Q4NTE5ZWRiNTQzZjZhZWZiNTBkODRjZTlkMjE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“As if I could ever forget a single word you said,” I responded, feigning confidence.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NTlhYzg1NGYzZDQyMzQ4NTQ0NzYzYTZiOGY0MzU0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really?” Ayumi’s expression seemed doubtful. “Then refresh my memory. This silence is starting to be a bit too much for my taste,” she said as she turned on her flashlight and continued deeper into the building.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMzBhZGYzZGRjMzQ1NWE5ZGE1M2UwZWJiMDBkOGIz"><span style="font-weight: 400">From her tone, she probably meant for this little exchange to make me look like a fool, get a few laughs in, and lighten up the mood. Unfortunately for her, I’m not oblivious enough to fall for her tricks.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMzU2YzMzYTBhMjRkMWE4YmUyNzZhYWZmMzYxM2Nh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet, here I was, sneaking through broken windows into a house that was all but a ruin on a frigid winter evening. Ironic.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NDA5ZmMwOTVmZDQzZmQ5ZWRiNWY2ZjhjMzI5OGIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, to answer the girl’s question. Since a few years ago, the country has been plagued with sightings of what could only be called supernatural incidents. Ghosts, apparitions, poltergeists, UFOs, the whole shebang. Our town was no exception. This house in particular has been in a state of ruin for as long as I can remember, and naturally, it attracted the attention of many a ghosthunter.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZTkzYzAxYTZiNzRkMGI4YzExZjc5NzFmZTgxYTBh"><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Ayumi wasn’t after any old ghosts. Oh no. She was after a specific subset of apparitions, one who caused people to see a strange light and faint on the spot.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNzQ1NDc3NGFhYjQxYjZiMDczNGI2NTk1NjQ4M2Ni"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, that’s right. We came here precisely because of those darn lights. Not for the ghosts and other crap believed to be haunting this place.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMGI4OWIyZTNmZjQ2YmVhYjg4NTZiZDlmNWQzNTQ0"><span style="font-weight: 400">But apparently, that still wasn’t the right answer.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNjRhZThiYTE5MTQ1NzFhNTNkZmM3ZTQ1ZDk3NzNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">With a stomp, she whipped around to face me again; the tatami mat floor made a worrisome groaning response. “Nhgn… S-Some lights? That’s super vague! At least call them by their name! They saw an angel! And just a few hours ago, at that. This is our freshest lead yet! Where’s your passion?!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMmQxZDUwYmY3MTRiZTFhNGEwMmJlMTM4YTYxNGQ1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You have enough passion for both of us. I’m here to make sure you don’t do anything dangerous.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZWEzYTc4MzYyOTQ2YmNiZmI5ZThkYjk1YzU4YWFi"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Or stupid. Those usually come hand in hand with you.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnMyMDZlZWFiYzA0NDRjMTNiMDI1ZDVjNTA5MDI2ZDBm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know that…” She adjusted her hairpin, which was about to fall off due to her careless stomping, and continued walking. “I was just hoping you were starting to enjoy hunting for angels with me.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MDQxZjJlYWRjMDRhZjBhNzYwZDVlMGZjZTI5MDg5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, that isn’t happening any time soon.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZmQ0MzdhOTI4MTQ4NzM5OTZmOTFjYTUwZWQ2ZTc2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ayumi sighed and walked deeper into the dilapidated building without a word. With a swish of her hand, she opened a nearby sliding door.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYTg1YmUxMzJjNzQ1OGU4ZmQ2ZDliY2YyNjI2N2Fm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Takkun, this is the first room we need to investigate,” she said, her emerald-green eyes shining with glee.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNDY1OTlkODM1MTQ0ZTFhZjVkODYxMjI5MWNjNjUw"><span style="font-weight: 400">This room used to be covered in tatami mats, but they had rotted away or had been ripped over the decades, exposing the wood below. Nothing of value left inside. But that didn’t demote Ayumi, who still had her trademark dazzling smile plastered all over her face. She rummaged through her bag and took out an old-fashioned notebook and pencil. “Record a decent enough video while I look around for clues. And make it all shaky and stuff. Adds to the atmosphere.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YTZhMmIxY2VlZDQ1MTI5YjU3Zjk2Y2RiMzVhMzVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Resigned, I did as ordered.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzY2I5OGNjOGMzZjQ2MzA4YjJmNDRlZjNkZDUwYzE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ayumi and I investigated the entire minka for a good while. We turned over every object, even going so far as to lift the few tatami mats that were left, without finding anything substantial. Honestly, I can't say I wasn’t a bit disappointed. This place was supposedly more cursed than an abandoned road-side love hotel, but we weren’t seeing anything unusual. That begged the question as to what exactly this so-called “curse” was in the first place.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NzIzNmFiYTczYjQ4NTY5N2QxMTM5YjAzNmRlZjhj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The rumors say that the husband brought people into a secret room, then tortured and killed them,” Ayumi responded.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OWQ2NGQ4NTAxYjQ4NWVhNTkyMWFmOTZjZjg5NDkw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yikes. I hope that’s not true.”</span></p><span class="cjY0ZWEwN2QxYTMzNjQ1YWM5YjA1YzZjYTJkZTk0ZGJj"><br/>This tale has been unlawfully lifted from Royal Road. If you spot it on Amazon, please report it.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNlM2MyN2RlNGQ2YzQ2ZTFiMmEzMTM1NzQ1ZjBkMzAx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Perhaps it is, perhaps not. What we do know for sure is that the tenants had some complaints: furniture moving on its own, blood dripping from walls... You know, the usual stuff.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MWUxMTY4ZjUzYjQyZGFiYWUzZGRkNTIxYzkwZjNl"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">You call that the </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">usual</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400"> stuff?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnM4ZGM0YzE2Yjk0OTQzOWJiOTc3MGI0ZTcyNjZkMDRk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“But while I was investigating the case, something caught my attention. The latest visitors have seen other mysterious events not related to that story. For example disturbances to electronic devices, and the hallways being dark despite light coming through the windows. Or a wall you can walk through.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMGNmN2Y3MTEyMTQ1ZDlhNmE2ZDY2ZjUyMjk1NzNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That sounds suspiciously like a secret door to me.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhY2NkMDU3YzUxZjRkNDRhMDk3MzBmOTU5ZmRiNmE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ayumi replied to my comment with narrowed eyes. “Not that, silly. It’s an actual solid wall that you can walk through as if it was air. The speculation going around is that a door once stood there, but it was removed by someone… or some</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">thing</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNjdiOGE3MmQ2YTQ2ZTY5ZjRjZjJhMzkwZjViNmI3"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Please don’t say something with a straight face.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnM4ZjlkZDNmMjcxZDQ3ZWE4ZmE5NTFlZmEzNDg1MzNi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because of those details, I’ve had my eyes on this place for some time now. That last report was the final straw. Seeing lights and fainting for no reason is a clear sign ‘angels’ were here. Why though, I have no idea.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMjNkMzA4NDkxYTQwODVhNDE3MDU0YTc5NjljYzcw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe they felt some kinship with the ghosts?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MTFlM2Y0MWFhZTRlMmNhNjBmNTBiNWY0ODYwZjI2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ayumi’s glare made me feel like I had just uttered the most barbaric of offenses.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYWI4NWM1OWU4MDRjNTQ4ODljODcwOGRlZTU3NTFk"><span style="font-weight: 400">Joking even a little about this absurd urban legend around Ayumi was a terrible idea. I should have known better. She was so serious about it at that point that it had become an obsession like no other. And field trips like these, where she—well, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">we</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">—went looking for them, were like her lifeblood.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMzc4MjdmZGNiNzRkMjQ5MmIyZjdjNzAwMWI3OGQz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Unsurprisingly, we didn’t find anything out of the ordinary inside the mansion. Despite exploring every nook and cranny of the place, it was evident that, if something had happened here, it had been destroyed by time. No blood on the walls, no weird spooky noises, nothing. There was not a trace of evil to be found in this residence.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkN2MzYWI0Y2ExNzQxN2VhMDRmZjk3NDYwNTA5YjE0"><span style="font-weight: 400">As for that famous wall…</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNzZjYTIwMjA4OTQzMTRiMzY0MDM1OGMzNzUxNDhk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s completely solid!” Ayumi exclaimed after she examined the hallway it was supposedly in.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzliMjhlZGQ0OTQ1ZDg4NTg0OGIwMzYzZTNhMGZj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmph. No surprises there.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NDM2MTZjZjNkYjRjMzU4MTMyZWY2MzAwNDE5Y2M5"><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl scrunched up her nose and grumbled.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MTZjZjAxYzhhMjQxNjZiYTFiMTdkZjUyYTE4MjUz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, that was the last thing to look at. What a shame. This was another dead-end. No evidence of angels either, as usual.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYjViODYzNTJhZjRlZDNhMmM0YWU2Y2Q5ODZlNTUw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ayumi called this ‘paranormal journalism’. I called it what it </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">truly</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> was: a waste of time. After all, there was a 99% chance she would find nothing of value during these investigations—and even if she lucked out, it was hard to relate to the supernatural in any way.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhODVlY2E0ZTk4OTQ5OTZiMzExOGNkNWY5N2Y1MjRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Having taken enough videos of the innocuous wall to last a lifetime, I leaned on it to prove that, once and for all, that it was solid.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNDkwODc5MDVhYjRiYzhiNGE2ZTRmMTIxZDc2MmVi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can I suggest something?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2N2IxODhhYTM1NzRhMGQ4MWEzMzA4NjE0OTRkMTYz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ayumi looked at me with her gaze sharp as a knife. “I have a feeling I know what you’re going to say, but go ahead.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNGNmNjJmMDRjMDQxODM4YjYyYTgxY2I4NjBhN2Ew"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe—just maybe—these people are making it up or remembering things incorrectly. This is the, what, thirtieth or so time we’ve followed these rumors about weird lights, and we always come out empty-handed.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZWRmMTE3ZTRkNDRkNzJiODU4YzZhZTk5ZDk3MmFl"><span style="font-weight: 400">In response, Ayumi stomped the floor with surprising force. The entire house groaned as if being awakened from a long slumber. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">She has some scary strength despite her size.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnMwMDAyNDM5YWM4ZTRiZDVhNTA5NjNhYjI0YTljM2Q0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s what’s so frustrating! They could at least leave some sort of dubious hint behind, but it’s always the same. Nothing!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNmQ0ZDlmYmY0ZDQ4MmU4ZWNiYTczMjQ0ZjM0ZGQ4"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Why would they leave any hints behind? That would ruin their entire mystique. If they exist, that is.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnM5NGVlN2FmYjcwMjQzN2RiYzQwM2U2Zjc3OTg1OGVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I concede some people may be lying or making it up, but there’s no way all these similar reports coming from all over are a coincidence,” she concluded.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MzMyNDhjOGMyMzQ4ZDM4ZTBmNjFiZGQxODU5ZGY2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I bet that you and others writing about it leads to more people thinking they fainted because of these lights. That’s how urban legends start in the first place.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNWNhMzUzZDQ3NjQ1ZjQ4YTQxZWEzNDM4Njg5ODkz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ayumi mumbled, but I couldn’t quite hear what she had said. Deep down, she knew I was right. But even after so many years of this back and forth, she still wouldn’t budge an inch.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYmZiMmMwOWYyNTQ5ZTA4NWI0ZmM3NDRkNDA1Yzk5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Thus, a moment of tense silence fell upon us. Surprisingly, it was the crestfallen Ayumi who had broken it first.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyOTI4NDJjN2VjMjQ0NzdiMTY1NmIzZDljNDEyMmRi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, we’ve explored every nook and cranny of this mansion. I guess it’s time to go back.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYmQ3ZTE3MmQ4NDQyZGNiM2ZjMGMzYmI3NTY2OGY3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead of making her exit the way we came in, she instead took a shortcut through a room we had never crossed before. The mistake made her not check if the floor was safe to walk on or not.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMTc3NmU0ZmZhZjQyNDI4ZTEzYmNkNTU2MWI5YjI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">And that’s when it happened.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNTVjNTJiZWFjZTQxZWU5OTZkMjRmODM3YWZiZGFl"><span style="font-weight: 400">The rotten wood floor beneath Ayumi collapsed in the blink of an eye. Before I even had time to realize what was happening, I rushed to grab the girl’s hand.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMmU3NTA0NzIyZTRlZTU5ZThiOWIwMGU5YWYyOWY4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-Takkun!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNDI4ZWY0ZWI1NDRjZGViNzUzMDhiNmE2Y2Q2ODll"><span style="font-weight: 400">Her legs were dangling over the open hole. The only things stopping her from falling were my hands grabbing her left hand and her right gripping the rim of the pit.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlN2ZiN2FlMTc3MjQ3Nzg4OWYxYjQzYTJkNGJmMWYx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Grhh! Just grab on tight!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4N2U3M2Q0YmE1OTQ1ZTg4NjU5OGY0OTc2YzdkZjM3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Thankfully, Ayumi was a very petite girl, so even my sofa-trained muscles were enough to pull her back to relative safety.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiODVhYTI1ODA3NTQ2NWFhMzVkZmY1N2E4ZWM4OGNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you alright?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhODJmYmRmNjY5MjRkN2RhNzk5ZGUwMTE2MzllNzA0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah… I think so,” she said with a haggard voice. “Damn, my skirt and blazer got ripped. Guess I’ll have to get new ones. But I’m fine!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYWVlNjk0OTA3MTQ3YTdiNmU3ZGU2ZTZjMmJkNjI5"><span style="font-weight: 400">She flashed a smile, but her face was paler than I’d ever seen her.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZDQ3OWJhODg2MjQ4YThhY2Q3MTJmZTY0NWRlOTYy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Darn it. I knew we shouldn’t have come here. This was too dangerous,” I said.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhN2ZlZWQ4NzJkMjRiMmFiODA4MGViYmE1ZTM2MmQ0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, you gotta take some risk in this line of—” Her speech was interrupted by another loud cracking noise coming from somewhere.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZWMwNTI4Y2ZjZTRjNjc5YWFjOWIxOTMzNGU5OGE1"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">That doesn’t sound good.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnM3ODZjM2FjYzExMjQ2YjJhMmYwYTU4YTI1NGY2MGEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We shouldn’t be here any longer.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOTBlMDZlZjVlZTQwY2JiZmVlOWE4MTA0MDg5ZTJk"><span style="font-weight: 400">For once, Ayumi agreed with me. “Yeah. Let’s get out of here.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Njk1ZjY4OWQ0MzQ5NGRiOTlmMmQ0YzJlOTE0YTli"><span style="font-weight: 400">We raced out of the dilapidated building as fast as we could, as more and more frightening noises came from all around us. We managed to leave the same way we came, but as we put some distance between us and the building…</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OWZkOThjMGJiMjQ5NmY4MDVlZTcxOTY3ZjFkNWE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Woah!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxODg1YjZkN2UxOTRlYTZhNjYzYTE2Yjg1NzkwNzU5"><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned around as the loudest noise yet bombarded my ears. Before my very eyes, the tiled roof of the mansion collapsed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmODdlYzczNTA2ODRiMzM4YmNkOGQzNDVlYmFhOTgz"><span style="font-weight: 400">If we had been inside, we would have been toast.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYzVjMDljMjBjZDQ5OTM4MzM5M2I3ZmFmN2FjMGNm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ayumi stood there, speechless, for a couple of seconds.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NTZkYmIyNDY2NjQ3ZmQ4MjQ5YTYxZDlmNGMyYWNh"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Even this should be enough to get some sense into her, no?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnMyZjc1MThhZTU3YjRlMzU5MTE2ZDVhNzlmYjU0YmI3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, that was a close one, wasn’t it? Maybe the angels thought we were getting too close and tried to eliminate us? Ahahah!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YzdmYTYwNjMxMzQzOWRhOGNkYjBjNWI2YjBlOTdh"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">There really is no saving this girl.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnM5ZjI5NmEwNjBkYjRjNTA5MmRhOGQ2MWFhNzMwZmY1"><span style="font-weight: 400">While Ayumi was already making her way down the hill, I stopped despite myself; a nagging thought overcame the desire to get back home as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZDU1OWEzMGUxMzRiNzE4MDQ1MDE5YmE4N2Y3Zjdj"><span style="font-weight: 400">I glanced back at the minka peeking over the wall and pondered for a moment. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhMDU0ZDZmYjZkYzQ2NGFiODE0MmZlYjk2NjA4MWE2"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Did something supernatural happen here?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnM5MDI2ZTU1YzlkYTQ0YWQ5YzkwNmIwY2ExMTI4NGFl"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Could those angels actually exist?</span></em></p>
<p class="cnM4MWYxNmQwYmE1NTRkOTdiZGU2MzQ0NTM5MDRiNGQw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Takkun, what’s wrong?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMjM1YTVmYTJiODQ1Y2M5MDQyMDNjNjQ5YWYyODc2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ayumi’s intense voice brought me back to reality.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMzgzYWQzNTNkMzRiNTZhN2Y1MTE0OWM5M2ZlODM5"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Such silly thoughts.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnMxY2VkZDgzOWI0NDQ1NjNiNjdjN2M1NWIyNThmOTIz"><span style="font-weight: 400">I mentally slapped myself for being idiotic. Afterwards, I trailed my friend through the woods and back to civilization.</span></p>
