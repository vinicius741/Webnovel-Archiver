<p align="left" class="cnNhZTY4OTk1OGUzZjQwNmM5OTY4YzRlYzMzYzZjMzEw">Emma’s body felt even better than it ever had. Even though there was still daylight left to burn, consuming the dragon’s blood was like a rush. Her eyes glowed blue, and the hair on her head had transformed to that same color. It was like she was splashed with an entire ocean of power. The sun’s usually bothersome rays were completely drowned out by this sense of strength.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNkODhmMmYwY2JjMTQ5NjlhZDkyZjE3MmI0MDViZmNm">That was why Emma decided to hunt. The dragon and the child had claimed starvation, so Emma decided to test her new abilities. She focused magic into her ears, channeling the sound vibrations like a strange musical meditation.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMyNDVhOGFiMjM3MDRhOGQ5ZWJlZTI2NGFiNmFmZGRl">The distant thumping sounds of a large animal reached her ears, and the vampire decided to head in that direction. She left the dragon and Sora alone at a campsite. Even though it took much convincing from the little girl, Emma was able to give the dragon her due amount of trust. It also gave Emma time to parse through her own thoughts on all of the recent matters.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM3MmYyYmY3YjU3YzRlMjVhM2MzYWY0ZDY3Yzk2OGJl">She clutched the sword in her hand tight, expecting it to say something, yet there was no sass from Karlack. “What the heck is wrong with you? I’m surprised you stopped bullying me.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNhY2EzNmI3ZDU1MjQ3N2E5NjU4MTA1ZWQwNTFhN2Zh"><em>“</em><em>There is no reason to bully you, </em><em>m</em><em>y </em><em>l</em><em>ady. As you are now, I feel like I must obey you.”</em></p>
<p align="left" class="cnMzN2ZkMWJmNzllMTQ2Yjk5YWE1NzJkNTFhNDQyMjVk"><em> </em>Emma tilted her head, staring at her reflection in the shining sword. It was almost alien to her how much she changed. Her previously lifeless eyes were vivid blue orbs like deep oceans. Her face had filled out more, and she was exceptionally beautiful.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM0ODM3ZDc3YzI2ZTQwOGI4ODBiODJlM2E1MjRlYzEx">If she hid her fangs, people might not even be able to tell she was a vampire. Her full cheeks gained some color to them, and Emma’s body gained the energy and confidence to match.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMzMTdmZjU4NjQ0NzRjOWRiNDNhMDkzM2YwYTYyYjMy">She shrugged her shoulders at the sword’s answer. The vampire put more strength into her feet and took off running. The change filled her with joy. Her new speed felt completely alien. Emma felt that as she was now she was even faster than the cars in her previous life.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM4ZWFmNzNhYTliZTQzNmU4ZmQ0MjJjZjQzOGUxNzA5">Her coat whipped around in the wind, making her look like an edgy super hero. She wanted to laugh at the silliness of it, but doing so felt like it would be an insult to the dress she crafted herself. And even that piece of equipment gained a glow to it as if it was full of life.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMwNTgzZTI4MjAwMjQ1M2ViMmJmOTcxYTM2NTFmNTVk">It didn’t take her long to reach the target. She found another large clearing, and Emma’s eyes widened at the spectacular view.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM2MjQ4ZWE1ZjMwYjRlNTQ5ZjA2YzQ2Y2NhOTY4NzZi">Large woolly mammoths roamed the plains, and there were dozens of them. Though, unlike the ones from Earth, these had far more vibrant bodies. Many of them had orange or green tusks, and their large trunks were striped. The sounds of their feet rumbled the ground. Each large step was accompanied by a following quake, and they blew air out of their trunks like trumpets.</p><span class="cjQzM2Q5ZDZhNWE5ODRlMDliYjhiYWFiODk3N2QzMDkz"><br/>Unlawfully taken from Royal Road, this story should be reported if seen on Amazon.<br/></span>
<p align="left" class="cnM1Nzc1ZTRmYmQxOTRkMTliZmU1ODJiZDBkNTE4ZGEx"><em>“</em><em>What do you plan to do, </em><em>m</em><em>y </em><em>l</em><em>ady?” </em></p>
<p align="left" class="cnMyMGJhMjE5YThkYjQ1M2Y4YmQyMDUxMmJlNWE1MjA5">“There was something I’ve been wondering. You can transform into many forms, right? How come you can’t become a person?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMyZWE5YThkOTE0ODRlMmQ5NzNmMWQ0YjU4NDY1M2Ey"><em>“With all due respect, you’ve never tried to make me a person, and you never had such an ability. However, if I were to guess...Right now, there is a 98% chance that something like that could work.”</em></p>
<p align="left" class="cnNjMDZkNDI3ZDczYjRmZGQ4Y2E0ODJmZDViNTM3NDZi"><em> </em>Emma’s mouth flopped open. The vampire looked stupidly at the bastard sword in her hand, wondering if Karlack was merely playing tricks on her. “Will you still be the same strength?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNlYmU4ZTRhOGQzODRjMjc5YTkwYzExODQwMWQ5YTlk"><em>“My strength is always proportional to your own, </em><em>m</em><em>y </em><em>l</em><em>ady. If you wished for me to be humanoid, then I should be strong.”</em></p>
<p align="left" class="cnM3N2Q1ZDA3NTQwNDQzMGFhNDlhYWI5N2RkYzk4YWU4"><em> </em>Emma closed her eyes and let the mana flow through her body. The roaring torrent was like an icy blizzard waiting to flow out of her. She calmed the raging storm inside of her and let the mana bathe Karlack.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMyZmE4YTM2YmM4MTQxMzk4YmEwMDU2NTlkYTcyNTY3">A flash of white light, and the sword began transforming. The hilt became long snow white legs, ending in delicate black boots. The length of the sword formed into the torso of a gorgeous woman. Her arms popped out, and a cute face that looked similar to Emma’s own appeared where the tip of the sword used to be.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMzMjlhNDM0NDQ5ZTRjZGU4NzlhZDQ1YjdkZWJkZWIx">In front of Emma there stood a girl with a flowing maid outfit. The black and white complimented the girl’s features well. Short shoulder-length black hair, complimented the girl’s dark brown eyes. A smile graced Karlack’s lips, and she performed a practiced curtsy.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM2ZjA0OWIyZGExZjRlZjFhZDJiOWZhMWYzYWUxMjk0">“My lady, I have answered your summons.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM4M2Q3ZjI4ZDRlMzRjMzFiNjQ5ZDcwMjk4ZjBmNmI2">If Emma was stunned before, she could hardly speak now. She wanted to say that swords turning into people was impossible, but right in front of her, it had just happened.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM3M2NlOTljODcyMTRmNmNhMTQxYmQwN2E2NjE1NGQz">The girl leaned forwards and grabbed onto Emma’s cheeks. “Oh, I’ve never felt my lady’s face like this before, so this is how hands feel like?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMwMmQ4ZTdlN2MzOTQxOTg5YzA1OTFhZWU4ZmIzMjAw">Emma grabbed the girl’s wrists and pulled them away. “I can’t believe this really happened. That might make hunting these things even easier.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMyOWFmMDBhNDdjYzRmNTA4ODg3NDQ5ZTc1NWFkMDk4">Karlack turned towards the large behemoth of creatures prowling in the distance. “How do you propose we lure one of them away, mistress?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM4ZDFmYzlhZDkxMTRkZTdiYjMzODVhYTY0NjE3NTlk">“I was wondering if you had any ideas about that. I don’t really want to take them all at once.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNhYmY3ZmE1YjUyMDRhY2ZiMDk2YjBiMGM3MzI1ZDlk">The maid girl put two fingers to her chin, considering the options. She pulled a long black whip from underneath her dress. “I can use this to separate them.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNiZDgxMGFhNmMxYzQwM2ViNzAzMmU5NGY5MTZiZDNh">“A whip? First of all, where did that come from? And secondly, how is that going to do anything?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNjNDA0ZGQ0MTAzYjRmYWM4YzYzNzRmYTAxNGJiZjZk">Karlack cracked the whip in the air. “I believe these creatures are sensitive to sound. They have such large ears after all.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM4NmE1NGE0MDBmYTQ3ZDdhODNiMzA4NWUyNGRiMTE0">To prove her words true, the mammoths in the distance reacted to the cracking of the whip. The whole heard of them turned in Emma’s direction and immediately started charging towards the loud sound.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMyZjc1NTBiYzc1MjRmMGM4N2VhNGNkMDBjYjM4YWRl">“Well, I don’t want to question your methods, but it seems like you just pissed them off.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMwN2RkZjRkNDY3ZjQwNDM4OThjMDIzZGY4YTUzNGZi">Karlack grinned and snapped the whip once more. “Leave it to me, my lady.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMwNTJlMjEzNzAyNjRmODA5NmE0NGJlZTE5NWM0NWZh">Emma stared at the whip and smiled wryly. <em>I hope she’s still this nice after this power wears off...</em></p>
