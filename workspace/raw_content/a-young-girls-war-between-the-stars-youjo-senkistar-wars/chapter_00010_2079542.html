Taking it up, I looked the contraption over. It looked like a blank silver pocket watch attached to a thin chain of the same silvery metal. Clicking the button at the top, the cover opened to reveal the clear face and internal mechanisms. Reaching into it, I fed it a trickle of the Force and activated the battery. Immediately, all four mechanisms inside began ticking away, working in their default configuration.</p>

It didn’t respond and I sighed, feeling a bit disappointed even though I </span><em>knew</em><span style="font-style: normal"> it wasn’t complete. What I could feel off of it said it was working fine and keeping time accurately, ticking away four times over as each individual identical core worked. The problem was that it lacked the ability to interpret the Force at the moment. It could </span><em>interact</em><span style="font-style: normal"> with it, given the songsteel it was made of was steeped in the stuff, but it couldn’t actually understand commands being input yet. For that, I needed to learn more about the Force. I could </span><em>try</em><span style="font-style: normal"> to brute force it, leaning on the Force the entire time to make the inscriptions necessary to allow it to work, but I’d rather not go about it blindly and risk damaging it and wasting materials. </span><span style="font-style: normal">It seemed I would be spending some time in the library once we got back to the temple.</span></p>

However, a moment later, I felt it again—along with a distinct sense of close and </span><em>sharp</em><span style="font-style: normal"> danger. </span><span style="font-style: normal">Opening my mind a bit, I felt it then—several sources of anger and malice.

There was a gap in the center that looked just big enough however, so I walked back a few paces before running and diving through it, tucking myself into a roll as I hit the floor on the other side and coming up just short of the webs on the opposite side of the intersection.</p>

Taking a breath, I closed my eyes and reached into the Force. With a flick of the wrist, I sent the dagger I’d looted out of the room and flying down the hall the way I had come.

It would require testing—under conditions I could control and against someone I should expect to be able to sense me. </span><span style="font-style: normal">That, or I could ask Augwynne if these were just barely trained initiates.

With a pair of twists, the assembly came apart, revealing a pair of near identical sabers and a fist sized metal tube. Along with it came my sheathed knife, replacing the one I had been given for skinning animals—because you never knew when you’d need a piece of sharp metal over a lightsaber or Mage Blade for whatever reason.

A second twist had it extend to four feet, and a third to six. There were still enough sections inside to adjust it out another four feet, but it would be unwieldy and cumbersome for a weapon—but then, if I was having to extend it that far, it would be to use it as a tool. As a weapon, it made an excellent addition to one or both lightsabers, giving me reach that my height and limbs didn’t allow me yet—an advantage that would be invaluable regardless of my size, really. That, and I had gotten used to the reach the poleaxe gave me. Having it on demand would be nice.</p>

The casing, gears, and internal mechanisms were all made of songsteel, aside from the very small battery I’d installed, to keep it going should I stop putting Force into it and keep it from burning Force it had stored to keep running—a battery practically identical to the ones in our lightsabers, save that it was miniaturized. Where in previous computation orbs elinium had been used, I had replaced it with kyber crystal, meticulously shaped to specification by the forge in the <em>Chu’unthor</em><span style="font-style: normal">. The ‘glass’ face was actually a thin layer of kyber crystal itself, allowing me to see the mechanisms inside and verify they were moving correctly.</span></p>

<p class="cnM4YzdmMjNlNzhkMTRmNjdiZmQ1OWI3NDA5NTJkZTNi" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Yes, actually,” I nodded, snapping the front cover closed.</p>

<p class="cnNlMTIyYWQzZTJjODQ0NTc4ZjA2ZTMyMTIxYWY1OThk" style="margin-bottom: 0">The woman huffed and shook her head. “I don’t see how you can dismiss everything we do as just applications of the Force, then turn around and claim that what you intend to do with <em>mathematics</em><span style="font-style: normal"> is magic.”</span></p>

<p class="cnNiNGNlM2NjZDQ3YTRiZWRiNTg1MGRkY2UzMWQwZjhm" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">Augwynne sighed. “For someone so smart, you can be so closed-minded.”</p>

<p class="cnNlMWE5NjM3NDIyNDQ4Yzg5YjE5NGVlYWFjOWE1NzAy" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<em>Logical</em><span style="font-style: normal">,” I countered with a smile. It was a familiar argument. “I prefer verifiable fact to belief. Hard evidence to faith.

<p class="cnM3MGI3MzQxZDMyNDQ0Mjc4YzFmN2I5NTQzMjJmZGNh" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<span style="font-style: normal">If it works,” master Dooku cut in before we could devolve into yet another philosophical argument, “</span><span style="font-style: normal">then every Jedi will want one.”</span></p>

<p class="cnMzMDlhNGE0ZjIyNDQxYTBhZjU3MDdiYWIzYjk5ODkx" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">“My… sister,” he admitted, and I raised an eyebrow. “There is a matter on Serenno. She contacted the order for aid and master Sifo-Dyas contacted me. We have a few days to prepare, then we must return to Coruscant where we will meet master Dyas and I will address the Senate to request aid for Serenno. I estimate we will be on Coruscant for perhaps a week before we set off again.”</p>

<p class="cnMyN2M5MWIyY2IyNDQ3MGY5ZWZkNjM5M2QwNGZiYmU2" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Mm,” I murmured, finishing off the last of my meal. Looking to Dooku, I asked, “What happens if the Senate refuses aid?”</p>

<p class="cnNmMDA2NTQ5OWQ4ODRlNTY5Y2QwZGUwYTI3ZGIyZTg5" style="margin-bottom: 0">“They are duty bound to provide it.” I sent him a skeptical look and he gave a rueful smile. “But that seems to be a common complaint lately—the Senate not honoring their commitments to protect their member planets from predation. If it comes to that, then the Jedi Council will send someone to Serenno to attempt to negotiate peace. Myself and perhaps one or two other Jedi and their padawans. I would, of course, be including you.”</p>

<p class="cnM1ZWFjNzY4NjE1NDRjY2FhMTc1YjgwMTE0ODFiMTcw" style="margin-bottom: 0">Humming, I leaned back in my seat. “Is this a <em>ground conflict</em><span style="font-style: normal"> or a </span><em>space conflict</em><span style="font-style: normal">?”</span></p>

<p class="cnM3YThjZGZiZjBlOTRiZTdhODcxYmU4Y2VmNDc2ZGM1" style="margin-bottom: 0">“A little of both. Pirates began raiding Serenno. After which, my younger sister hired Abyssin mercenaries to protect the planet, due to my older brother Ramil’s lack of response. Now, it seems someone has bought out the mercenaries and is attempting a coup of Serenno.”</p>

<p class="cnNhYjc5YTAzOThjNDQ3ODlhMGIwNjZkZjk5YjgyZTYy" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Probably Ramil,” Augwynne pointed out, and when I sent her a questioning look, she shrugged. “Think about it. Who stands to gain the most?”</p>

<p class="cnMyMDI3ZWY0NThkNTQxNTA4ZDJkZThmNTAzMzAyNWEy" style="margin-bottom: 0">“I fear you are likely correct,” Dooku sighed, before sending me a curious look. “Did you have something in mind?”</p>

<p class="cnNlNjc5NTNjNWExYTRiNTg5ZTUyMTBkOGFjNTI2MmU4" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Just a thought,” I shrugged. “Why not hire mercenaries to deal with mercenaries?

<p class="cnNjOGJiODliYTY2NjRmNWNhNTE1MTQwMGFlYmMzN2M1" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNhZjczZDEzM2ViZTQ3NDM5M2U4ODBiYTJmYzNmZDAy" style="margin-bottom: 0">Reaching up, Dooku stroked his beard in thought. “You may be correct. I seem to recall that the Mandalorians are in the middle of their own civil war and the Pacifists have requested our aid, which the Council has been in deliberations over for nearly a year. Perhaps we could help each other…”</p>
