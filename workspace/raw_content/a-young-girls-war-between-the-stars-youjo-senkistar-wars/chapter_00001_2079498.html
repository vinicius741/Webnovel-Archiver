A </span><em>wounded</em><span style="font-style: normal"> enemy, on the other hand, took up enemy resources. And as I watched two other enemy soldiers fly in to catch him as he sent out a call for help, I lined up my new rifle and popped off a few rounds into the back of one. The remaining soldier was forced to choose and picked the one I’d </span><em>disarmed</em><span style="font-style: normal">, even as his buddy hit a roof and went limp. He was still moving so if he didn’t bleed out in the next three minutes, there was a chance his friends would send someone down to get him. Grinning, I decided to give them that chance and turned away, keeping in mind where he was as I took in the battle going on around us.</span></p>

<p class="cnNiMjgyYzcxOWI5ZjQ4OWU4ZGZkYTM2ZjIzODI5YTkw" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">The magical radio waves were a cacophony of soldiers calling out orders, status updates, cries for help, demands for ammunition—and that was just on our side. The encrypted frequencies the enemies used were just as busy. So, ignoring the radio since there was no clear way of getting orders through one way or another over the din at the moment, I used a combat formula to alter my perception of time for a moment—the battle slowing around me and allowing me to finally find my men, for the first time in the last several minutes since we’d been separated.</p>

<p class="cnM3ZDFiZGM3NWIyMDQ5MmFiMzFkYjU0MmQ4ODQ3OThk" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">I spotted Weiss first, just in time to see the big man speared through by bayonets in a pincer attack—one from the front, one from the rear—even as a third soldier raised a trench shotgun to his head and ended my subordinate’s career. My heart clenched in my chest and my teeth ground in my head so loud I could hear them over the gunfire and explosions as I took off in that direction.</p>

Beside his remains, Schwarzkopf had been blasted out of the explosion, a spherical barrier surrounding him momentarily, before multiple lines of rifle fire tore into it. The shield collapsed and another of my subordinates was riddled with bullets.</span></p>

And for what? For a government that had been too foolish to listen to my warnings </span><em>every step of the way</em><span style="font-style: normal">? Who had mismanaged this entire war from start to finish? Who had expanded and rushed ahead, when they should have struck and withdrawn after that very first incursion—</span><em>maybe</em><span style="font-style: normal"> committed a retaliatory decapitation strike, but not… not what had happened. Not steamrolling an enemy so quickly, so thoroughly, that it </span><em>terrified</em><span style="font-style: normal"> the rest of our neighbors into jumping on us in a mad, suicidal frenzy that only grew the longer we lasted.</span></p>

Part of me wanted to call it. Break into the radio channels and order a complete surrender, if only to spare my men. I felt I owed them that much, to do whatever it took to see their lives spared. The other part, however, knew the bitter truth. That surrender would just be a prelude to a very short, very vicious series of show trials, where they would invent new crimes and retroactively find us guilty of them, then the loyal subordinates I cared for would be put to death by firing squad.</p>

I hadn’t wanted to use it for this. I had wanted to fight and win on my own terms.

<p class="cnNkNjY4MDljMmY0YjRmY2FiMzgwNDY4YjE3NDljNGMx" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">I returned it reflexively as I surveyed the men.

<p class="cnMyODc0MWZjOGIyYzQ4MWVhN2ExNWZlNTRiYmRlZWZj" style="margin-bottom: 0">Visha paled, turning to look at me wide-eyed. “Weiss? Granz too? They’re, they’re both dead?”</p>

<p class="cnNhN2FiZGUwMDgzNDQwOTFiMjNiNTg1YjhmNjQ4MGQ2" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Yes,” I confirmed, and she turned away, closing her eyes for a moment as she reached up and wiped at them. Taking a breath, a look of unnatural calm settled over her face. I had seen Viktoriya angry before. Angry, frightened, and a whole host of other things over the years. This was the first time I’d seen her like this.</p>
<p class="cnMxM2E3MjFhMGJiZjQ3NDJhY2ZjNjUzNzIxYmM1YWNk" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM4ZGFjNWZkNTc4MjQ4NDRhNzM1Y2YwNDU2OGQ3YWFh" style="margin-bottom: 0">“What’s the plan?”</p>

<p class="cnMwYzM2NzE3NjllYjQxMTJiNDY1NDg5YTJlN2IxN2E3" style="margin-bottom: 0">I smiled. This was why I liked her. Even when she was at her worst, Visha would focus on whatever was necessary to complete the mission and survive. Weiss was the most competent. A man I could trust to carry out any task I gave him. Granz was the most charismatic, with that boyish charm of his. He was what we in my former HR career called a retriever—someone who made friends and could see to the group’s morale. Visha however knew that if she stuck to my side and did as I said, her odds of survival increased exponentially. It was why she had become my wingman in addition to my adjutant whenever the situation allowed for it.</p>

<p class="cnNkMDFiNTNiODVlNTQxOTNhZDYyYzhhYTkxOTgyMzFm" style="margin-bottom: 0">Visha thought for only a moment before smiling. It was a nasty smile, entirely full of teeth and beautiful. “Decapitation strike, then.”</p>

<p class="cnM5YzJiYzE3ZTBkYzQ5Mzc4Zjk0N2UyZWQzOTE2ZmUw" style="margin-bottom: 0">She really knew me too well. This was the value of a well-trained subordinate—the ability to anticipate my plans and needs and do what it took to see them taken care of. It was something the commies didn’t understand, <em>could never</em><span style="font-style: normal"> understand as they didn’t place any value on the individual. The Americans understood, but </span><em>they were killing my precious subordinates</em><span style="font-style: normal"> so they should also understand why I’d have to take measures to stop it.</span></p>

So looking within and feeling a foreign power there, feeling it in use when the woman projected her emotions at me, or when I did the same back at her reflexively when I was upset, all came naturally.

I needed to get myself mobile and walking again, soonest. That would also take time to develop the muscles, coordination, and balance necessary. The sooner I could do that, the sooner I could rid myself of the indignities of being a child and having to rely on others for basic things. Once I got old enough, I would need to get myself into top physical form again, to be ready for whatever Being X planned to throw at me.</p>

Something I could start right this moment, in fact. The power inside me needed to be examined, studied, and experimented with until I knew it inside and out, the same way I knew my magic. </span><em>That</em><span style="font-style: normal"> I could at least do on my own. No need for other people to teach me until I understood the language. By the time I got to where I could be taught, I wanted to have the same sort of fine control over it that I’d had over my magic.</span></p>

<p class="cnM3NDQxYTJlNjc5MTQ4ZjNhNTkyZGRjYjFlOWJkZjJh" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal">With that decided, I settled in and began experimenting with the power inside me. The very first thing I did was try a basic formula. The power wasn’t magic, but maybe it would work similarly. So, I began the simplest formula I knew—the one they taught every mage recruit first thing. It was a simple spell to create a light near the body. Most people chose to attach it to their hand, or the end of a rifle, but I preferred the free floating light as it was far more versatile. </span><span style="font-style: normal">It was so simple that there was no way to mess it up. Even a recruit fresh on their first day should be able to do it.</span></p>

I grinned, marking that as a success.</span></p>

I quickly cut the light out as I felt exhaustion was over me. </span><em>So detecting and projecting emotions uses way less power than making a light, and my reserves are tiny. Of course they are. I’m at best a few days old. I’ll work on them. But first… a nap.</em></p>

In my dreams, I watched Visha burn to death before I made it to her. We both burned up in the blast. We survived, but the allied forces captured us and put us on trial. I woke to the image of standing before a field firing squad, lined up beside the rest of my men as Russy troops gunned us down one by one and kicked us into a trench.</p>

Focusing, I pulled on the power within me and envisioned a shield around my mind. The world went quiet and I looked around. My surroundings had changed drastically. Gone was the nice house I’d woken up in and the young woman looking at me with concern. In their place were a shabby looking room, a bed with scratchy sheets, and an older woman—also a shade of red—who looked like she spent most of her days frowning.</p>
