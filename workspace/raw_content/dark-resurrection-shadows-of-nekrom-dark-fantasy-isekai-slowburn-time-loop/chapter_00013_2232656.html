<p class="cnMyOWZmNTA4MjgxMzQ5YWY5MDY3ZWVkNzg2YjMxYjkx" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em">Leaving Tristessa speechless and visibly terrified, the housewife went to the dining room with a mop and a bucket full of water. There was no doubt that her threat had been serious. All the anxiety that the girl carried overflowed like a drop falling into a full glass; she had to hold herself against the counter to keep from losing her balance, breathing deeply and swallowing hard.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiY2E2YjliZmFmYTQ2ZDViNmM0NmQ5NDYxYWRmZTk0" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em">“Don’t you know what power crystals are, miss? Look, that’s how you change them!”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1M2JhMTc4ZWFmZjRjM2ZhMjUwZjE2MjRiNWRkMTY5" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em">With eyes close to bursting into tears, Tristessa looked sideways at the boy, who had approached the lamp. Crouching down, he opened the small grate at the base and disconnected the small crystal from a metal plate, instantly turning off the artificial light of the lamp but not the faint phosphorescent glow it seemed to have by default.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZGFhOTRjMDY5MDRkYTg4ZjE1NDBkYWI4ODcwMTNh" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em">“We took the spare one, put it in and…done!” he exclaimed, following those steps with another crystal of the same size but a different shape. The metal plate attracted it and the lamp's light came on again, this time with a little more intensity. “Here, look!”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMzE1NGU2YTkxZDQxNjhiYjk0MmE4NjU4N2NhODdl" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em">Lucahn approached the silent girl and offered her the almost exhausted crystal: it was cold to the touch, contrary to what one would expect given its function, and it caused a very slight tingling in the tips of the fingers.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhODExMGJiN2Y1OTQ3ODg5YmQzMTE1NWZkNTFlNWM4" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em">“When daddy comes back we will give it to him, so he can put it together with the other used crystals and Mr. Severus will take them to… Miss?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNWY3NDFlOTk0NTRlYmQ4ZTM5M2RlMmI1NWUwMDQx" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em">Tristessa had barely paid attention to the explanation; she had even taken the crystal unconsciously. A new technology, never before seen in her world, but the fear of Death was overwhelming, overcoming even one of the most basic of human instincts, which was curiosity.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMjgyMjU3ODZhYTRiMzE4NWZjOWViMDQ2MWMzN2Nh" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em">“Miss Tristessa?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzZjZkOGMwYjViNTQ3M2M5YzU0ZGI2ODhmN2MzZTA1" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em">Hearing her own name had a major effect on her, causing her to blink several times and tear her frightened gaze away from the threshold that led to the hall. She happened to see the cute face of the child in front of her, his peace waning and manifesting in a worried expression.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5M2Q5NGMxZjZhNDRkMTk5N2EzMzY3MTFiYWZmMjlm" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em">“It’s okay, Lucahn.” She sketched a smile, false and fragile, while repeating in her head over and over that Tiara was a woman who only cared about her son. Nothing more, nothing less. “S-so, crystals, huh? Where I come from, we don’t have these. How are they made?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNDVlZjIxZTFiYTRjMzdiMDliNDJiMzZmNGM4ODVm" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em">“The thaumaturges make them in their alchemy temples, but I don’t know how,” he replied, shrugging. He accepted the crystal from Tristessa, while she absorbed the new concepts presented to her. “Mommy should know, she’s a professor and she teaches me everything she knows. I want to be like mommy, a professor!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYjRiMmU3ODVhZTQ3YzY5NzhkYTcyNDQzYTk2Mjlm" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em">“Well, let me just say that you’re on the right track.” Tristessa encouraged him and reached out a hand to give him a friendly squeeze on the shoulder, but regretted it almost instantly, her mother’s harsh words attacking her conscience. Her hand ended up pointing towards the table, in a quick signal of guidance. “Tell me, what were you reading?”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMDAzMTRkYjVjYzRlNzlhYTJlZDAzMDMxY2MyZjM0" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em">Putting herself together as best she could, Tristessa walked over to the table and sat down next to the boy. Her uneasy gaze drifted to the kitchen entrance, unable to stop thinking of Tiara’s dark countenance and the knife she had pocketed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNjA0MmY4OGZjNzQ1NjQ5YTA3MDkxMDA4MmFiZDEw" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em">“It’s a storybook. It has <em>The Dark Tower</em>, <em>The Dawnsinger</em>, <em>Endrel, and Margules</em>,” Lucahn commented, turning the pages carefully. The paper was a little yellowed, and the edges worn with age. “Do you know any, miss?”</span></p><span class="cmZjMjJkYTI5MzQwNjQ1YTlhYTEwYjNjNGJhZWUwYjdj"><br/>The narrative has been illicitly obtained; should you discover it on Amazon, report the violation.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM2YjM1ZmVhOTk5MzRjMjRiMzY5OWRlZTQ4NWFmYjM5" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em">“No... I haven't had a chance to tell your parents yet, but I can't remember much of my life up until the moment Jin found me in the forest,” the girl justified herself, half lying. By the confused way the boy looked at her, she laughed in order to calm the atmosphere, as if her amnesia was something unimportant. “I don't know anything about stories, about crystals, about End-World. Nothing at all. Not even what this world is called.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjYTM2ZmQ4NWE3NTRlMTA4ZjI4MjBlNzYzYmFlYTYy" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em">“Well... It's called <span style="color: rgba(224, 62, 45, 1)"><strong>[<em>Nekrom</em>]</strong></span>. In honor of the Goddess <span style="color: rgba(224, 62, 45, 1)"><strong>[</strong><strong><em>Nekronomika</em>]</strong></span>, the first and only one to die,” he answered, clearly worried and looking with wide eyes at his companion, not knowing how to treat her now that he knew her condition. “Look, here.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZDhiODIyY2UyZTQxODc5YmQ5M2IyNzgzMGI4NjAy" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em">Lucahn turned to the first page of the book, where Nekronomika was illustrated as a female humanoid entity hugging in a dream a sphere of light almost the size of her body, surrounded by the darkness of an empty universe.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YTgzNTQyNDFiNzRlNzE5OTc4ODFiZTdlNjNkNDQz" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em">“<em>In the time before time, Nekronomika gave birth to the infinite worlds, but they were all empty and cold,” </em>the boy recounted, reading the glyph text beneath the drawing that took up half the page<em>. “Tired by her unending birthing, Nekronomika fell into an eternal sleep, and her will split into the fundamental aspects that make up the whole, to finish her work: Order, Balance, and Chaos</em>.”</span></p>

<p class="cnM5MzBkYzUwMGU0MDRlODJhZTE4Nzg3NDY4MmMyZmIy" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em">Lucahn turned the page, while Tristessa listened, her troubled mind calming down little by little.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMGEwYTc5YzlhODRlNGE4YTA0NDBiYTQ3M2ZhMDli" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 1em">“<em>Xiliarra sought to fill the worlds with Life, Light, perpetuity, and perfection; a vision of Order destined to fail.</em></span></p>
