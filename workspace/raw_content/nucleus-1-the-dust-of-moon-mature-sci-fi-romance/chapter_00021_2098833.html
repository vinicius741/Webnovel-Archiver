<p class="cnM1MTgxZjQzNzI4NTQzNzk5MmFlODU5MTM0ZTE3MGEy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva"><span style="font-size: 1.5em"><strong>X</strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400">in's hands tightened on the steering wheel as he abruptly turned down a narrow side street. The car's tires squealed.</span></span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTgxMGIxMDdiNzQ2MDJiMjQ4YWMzMDc0OWE5N2Zk"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Where are you going? The Starport's the other way." Lorna asked, her hand instinctively moving closer to her 10mm Magnum.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNDllNDdiMDUyZTQ4Yzk4ZTY3NjdlYWI2MDM5YjJl"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Surveillance grid ahead," Xin muttered, his eyes narrowing as he eyed the telltale shimmer of cloaked drones above the main thoroughfare. "Pattern recognition and thermal imaging."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZmMzYTZjZDBkMTQyNjlhNmRiNmI4ZDM5YmMzMDdl"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna followed his gaze, though the drones were nearly invisible against the morning sky. "You think they’ll flag us?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjc0ZDY3N2Y0OTRhYzBhMWU1OWQzNGM5Y2FlN2Fh"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"My green car? Absolutely." Xin replied with a bitter smile.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZDZjZjM4ZDJmZTQ0OWRhMzFlMTI3YzUxMWFiYWIy"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Well, I'll just assume you know what you're doing." Lorna sighed, sinking back in her seat.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhYzc3OWVlOWMyODRkNWVhNzVmMjFkYmQyNGJjMWFm"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"We're entering Old Taipei," Xin explained, his voice softening as the sleek glass-and-chrome architecture gave way to weathered stone and traditional red-tiled roofs. "The surveillance grid has blind spots here. The Imperium considers these historic districts too dirty to waste resources on."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNTFjYzU0Y2QzZTQwNTk4NzNlYzgzNTY1ZTJjMGUx"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Suddenly, a notification chimed from Xin's dashboard — a message in Mandarin scrolled across the screen. His expression darkened.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NzU0NzcyODMzNzQ3Y2M5NmRjZjcwNTRhMDdmMTZh"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">'全城重金通緝: 巫志鑫; 種族: 皇民; 罪狀: 竊盜資料、姦淫仿生人、竄改國造仿生人、意圖顛覆國家政權; 懸賞: 40,000 原核幣'</span></p>

<p class="cnNmYTQ3M2U5MDNmNzRjMjM4MWNmYWVmOTA2ODUzNDYw"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">The messages were accompanied by holographic portraits of both Xin and Lorna, clearly composites – part actual surveillance footage, part crude AI reconstruction. The algorithms had done their worst, making their features sharper, meaner.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYzVkNTY0MDk1MDQ3NjBhZGY2MDU0ZGRjZGJkZjMx"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"What is it?" Lorna asked, though she recognized her own distorted face floating above the dashboard.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YmZlMGRlMDFlMjQwMGRhYjIzMGJjMWUzNjdkNzZh"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"The national security just issued an all-points bulletin for our arrest." He pressed his palm against a biometric reader on the dashboard, and the car's exterior shimmer subtly shifted. "Camouflage mode. Won't fool a direct scan, but it'll buy us time."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MTViZWFiYzEwMjRmMjg4NDZiODFiMjc1YmRhODg0"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">On the dashboard, both portraits showed them grinning and laughing menacingly – Xin with a sneer he'd never worn, Lorna with a predatory expression, baring her white teeth, her eyes altered to glow with unnatural malice.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5OTdjZjg5MGRmOTQ1YTQ5MTA5MmVkYTE0YzBmMWEy"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Really?" Lorna watched the dashboard in amusement, resting her head on her palm, leaning against the car door on her side. "They've made me into some sort of Saturday morning show villain."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMGU3ZTZkOWFlZDRmY2Y5MWU4ZTcwMGY0NjhjMWUw"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"That just means you're doing the right thing, pissing them off so much." Xin chuckled as he continued driving, though the tightness around his eyes betrayed his nervousness. "And apparently I'm guilty of 'attempting to overthrow the state'. Always wanted to add 'revolutionary' to my resume."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDEwYjZiZWQxOTQ0ODNiYjhmNTU5OTdhMWMwZDcz"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Can't read Imperial texts, but they're saying sixty thousand Atomic Credits for me, forty for you, right?" Lorna noted with mock indignation.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZmM0Zjk5ZjE4OTRhYWQ5NmFjZjkzY2Y4YTVmZDM2"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva"> "That they are. Flattered, I suppose." Xin replied with a grim smile. Though his tone was light, his heart raced at the sight of their bounties displayed so prominently.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YjI2ODIyYmZjYzQyZDM5NDUwZTRkYTM1OGFjYzQ2"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">The car descended deeper into the labyrinth of narrow streets. As the gleaming towers faded behind them, Xin felt the familiar loosening in his chest that always came when he entered Old Taipei. The sterile uniformity gave way to chaotic vitality — street vendors hawking their wares, elderly residents playing elephant chess on makeshift tables, children darting between buildings despite the chilly February air. Home, or the closest thing to it.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNzQ4MTA0NTdjOTQzODY5YTdhMDJkNjUyYjZkYjhi"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"You seem different here," Lorna observed. "More alive."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OGVhMzViNTk4NDRiYmM5MWNmMGRhMGQ5M2Q5ODhj"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Do I?" Xin allowed himself a half-smile, consciously relaxing his shoulders. "This is one of the few places where I don't feel like I'm wearing a mask."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZDk3NDdhYTA5MjQ0YTg5YjY3NjUzNzQ5ZDAzNTEw"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">As he drove through the winding streets, Xin exchanged subtle greetings with locals — a quick nod to Old Man Liang selling tea leaves, a hand gesture to Mrs. Chen arranging her fruit display.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YzBhOTZjODU1ZDQ4ZWM4NmM5NTJkOWEyMjg4MmM3"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna noticed. "They know you."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZmE2MDBiNTcwZDRlZjU4N2U3ZmY1MmM4YzJkZTYx"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"My uncle was respected here. These people remember." Xin checked the rearview mirror. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyNjI0NjJlZWRiMDRlYmJhYzFlMjFiZTc1ZDMyYWNl"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"We should keep moving, though," Lorna said, checking the time on her Quantum Watch. "Thomas and Emmanuel will be waiting."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYjMwNmUzZjAyODRlNGE5NzQyYzEwNTdhYjlkNWZi"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Just two minutes," Xin insisted, the urgency building in his chest. He rarely revealed this part of himself to outsiders, but something about Lorna compelled him. "There's something I’d like you to see."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MjlhODYyMmZiYjQ1OGNhYzNiYzlmZTE0NDgyNjk0"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Fair enough." she let out a sigh, walking next to him.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNmQyZWZhYWRmMzRlYjg5NDM4NGQ1MTk0ZWMxY2Mx"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Imperium calls this place 'Swindler's Ponds' now," he explained, bitterness seeping into his voice despite his efforts to contain it. "But for decades, it was the 228 Peace Memorial Park — built to commemorate the genocide that led to Taiwan's struggle for independence. That was back in the Digital Age, when such things mattered."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOWY4ZmJjZTljMDRjNDc4OGY0ZTJmOTIzMWE4NjMx"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">They approached a circular plaza that appeared unremarkable at first glance.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZjAxNmQ2Yzc5NzQyNGM5MDE0MDcwNGRiMDYxYzE3"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Here," Xin said, gesturing to what seemed like an ordinary arrangement of white stones and red flowers. "Look at it from this angle."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YWI2YTNiYTY3OTRiMTU4OGFkZjY4NTY5ZDZiYzVh"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">He watched as Lorna tilted her head, following his direction. Her cerulean eyes widened slightly as the pattern revealed itself — the white stones forming the numbers when viewed from their position, while the red flowers created a subtle outline resembling Taiwan's geographical shape. The recognition in her expression brought an unexpected warmth to his chest. "Two – two – eight?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMmY5ODc0OGMwYTQ0ZWVhYTE2N2ViNDgxNjVmOGNi"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yes. The gardeners are part of the resistance," Xin explained, lowering his voice. "They maintain these symbols right under the Imperium's nose. There are dozens like this throughout the city—a secret language for those who know where to look."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZjUzM2VmYzEwYTQwYjFhNWU3MmEzMWEyNDQyY2Yw"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Clever," Lorna remarked. "But why show me this?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MWY0ZWM4ODdkNjQ5ZTQ4M2I0MzQwODE4OGNhZjMy"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"My uncle designed the Constitutional Republic's flag before the Imperium executed him in the final purge." Xin met her gaze directly, surprised by his own openness. He rarely shared these details with anyone, yet something about this Alliance agent inspired a strange trust. "This green car was his. Driving it openly is my way of carrying on his resistance."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMzllNjI1MmFlYjQ2MGM4ZDcwNjI3YmIwMWFmNGUw"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">The words hung between them. Xin waited for judgment or dismissal, but instead saw understanding dawning in Lorna's blue eyes.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjY2YyMGQzNWMyZTQ5YjRiODlmODE4MDIyZjUyMTli"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"My people have had...similar experiences in the last decade," she said. "Very different circumstances, but I understand the need to preserve who you are."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNGI0ZTBhYTM5OTQyNDU5NDNlZjM3MmNjNzM3ZjIw"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Confusion rippled through Xin. He tilted his head. "I thought you're a Valoran, though? Diverse and sophisticated cultures, valuing personal freedom. Widely known. Well preserved, too."</span></p><span class="cmZlNGM1YTk4MzM1MTQyNzNiMzU5ZDVkYTcyZjUwMWM5"><br/>This narrative has been purloined without the author's approval.

<p class="cnNhYjIxMTEzZjE5OTRjZDc4NDg5MGRhOGJiMTlkNWI3"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Something flickered across Lorna's face — a shadow of emotion Xin couldn't quite place. Her lips parted as if to explain, but before she could respond, his Quantum Watch emitted three sharp beeps. His blood ran cold — he recognized that pattern immediately.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NjRkYjVhZjg5ZDQ2MGQ4ZDhhNjdmZjJmNTY2ZDMw"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Drone," he whispered urgently, already calculating the fastest route to cover.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NzM0OTEwYTEzZjQ2YTg5OWRjODY2NzE0MGQ2OTNm"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Before he could move, Lorna's hand closed around his wrist. Strong, decisive. With surprising efficiency, she pulled him behind a large memorial stone, her movements fluid and practiced. Where he would have stumbled, she moved with precision, positioning them both in the shadow of the stone in one smooth motion.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMDAyOTRlZDc2NjQxNzg5Y2U3ODg1OWM3MDhmYTIz"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin huddled against the icy granite, with Lorna's larger body blocking him from sight, a soothing fragrance of lavender coming from her golden tresses. He felt thrown off balance by this gender role reversal - instead of him safeguarding her as he'd anticipated, she had taken charge of his protection.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2Y2YzMWVmZmVjNDQ5YWQ4YjI0MzczZWE2MmI0MTRl"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Uh, off-pattern surveillance," he managed to whisper, his heart hammering against his ribs as the drone hovered directly over the plaza. Its sensors glowed an ominous red as it swept the area. "Not routine. Someone's hunting us specifically."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MzU1MzRjZjllOTRmNmY4N2Y2ZGRmZDgwMDVhMjY5"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna nodded, her body still but alert, like a coiled spring. She reminded him of the elite operatives he'd occasionally glimpsed in ZenFusion's restricted areas — each movement impactful, complete spatial awareness.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMzZiY2RmOTA0ZTQ4N2RhZTI4MzFkZDQ4NjJhOGJj"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"It's running facial recognition," Xin continued, acutely aware of how she'd positioned herself — slightly in front of him, ready to move at a moment's notice. "Military-grade. Definitely not standard issue for park security — "</span></p>
<p class="cnM1MGFkNTlhYzRlMzQ5NzNiYTMyNjk0Y2EwZmE0NTk4"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"ZenFusion?" she cut in, her voice barely audible even though her face was inches from his.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NTI4ZTliYTU4ZDQ0YmY5NTdjNjZhYmJjZWRjZGMw"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin shook his head, forcing himself to focus on the threat rather than their proximity. "Worse. Golden Serpent Circle. See the insignia?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZDA2MGQ5NmVmMTRjZmM4Mzg1OTVjYzk2NWI1NTk2"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">He gestured slightly, and Lorna shifted to allow him a better view while keeping them both concealed. The drone bore the distinctive emblem of the Imperium's elite super agent unit — a golden oriental serpent devouring its own tail.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZjNkZjkyZTE1ZDRjNDZhMTE1NDcxZGMyYzBmMDc5"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Circle doesn't handle corporate theft. They're manhunters. Many are cruel and inhuman." he whispered, a chill running down his spine. "Dilinur's one of them, too. Though as an Unblooded, she isn't…very respected —"</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMmM1Zjg0Njk1ZTQxOGJiNDc3Mjc3MmU0NzQ0NDIx"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"We need to move," Lorna said, her voice tight with urgency. "Now."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NDM1ZTcyZGE5ZDQ2MzBiZjI5MDczZGJmZjcyOTc2"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"The exits will all be monitored," Xin whispered, his mind racing, recalling what little info he could from maintaining the legacy Golden Serpent software for back in his ZenFusion days. "There's a seven-second blind spot in their grid between here and the service road, but timing it..."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkY2Q0ODkxOGVlMzRjZDlhZmI1NjQ3OTBiMGUyMjQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna's eyes narrowed as she assessed their situation. "Show me the blind spot on your watch."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NzM0OGY5MTFiZjRkMDBiNjY0OGM0NGFhMjI1NzA3"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">With his Quantum Watch, Xin projected the surveillance map, his fingers trembling as he highlighted the path. "Here. But the drone will complete its sweep in approximately twenty seconds, and we'd need perfect timing."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZWI5NGQ1YzU5NDQwY2RiMzVmNmM3N2ZjOWNiNDM2"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"I've got the timing," Lorna cut in, taking his wrist to study the projection more closely. "You've got the knowledge. Let's use both."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkM2IyZjk1YTMwNjQ2OGI4NzMwNGY0NzhkOTMwOTll"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Her confidence steadied him. Xin nodded. The drone continued its programmed path, eventually hovering over the eastern edge of the park.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NWUwYTYxOTFjYTQ4ZDdhOTBhYzc1MDNkNTRlZjZi"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Now," Lorna whispered, already moving. Her steps were precise, deliberate, leaving minimal heat signatures.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1OGU5MzM2MjBkNjRhZDE4NDFkYjA4M2E4NWFiZWU1"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">He followed, trying to match her movements, feeling clumsy and obvious beside her fluid grace. Where she glided like a ghost, he stumbled over a root, nearly giving away their position.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNjRmMzJmZmU3ZDQyYWY5MzMyMzY5NGQyOGZiMTQ0"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Lorna caught his arm before he fell, steadying him with a strength that belied her feminine frame. "Easy," she murmured. "Breathe and move naturally."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MTllODllYzAyZDRjNDc4YmNiYjZhNTFlOTQ2Yzlk"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yeah. Thanks." he whispered.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NDQ3ZGFjNDI5MzQxMGY4MWM5ZWQ0NDE2MWRlYzE2"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">They reached the car just as Xin's Quantum Watch emitted a warning beep. The drone had unexpectedly changed direction, moving back toward their position.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDQwZDFjYjViNjRjZTk5NTQ2NDhkN2E4NjNmN2Y5"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"They've altered the pattern mid-sweep!" Xin hissed, fumbling with the car's access panel, his fingers suddenly feeling thick and uncooperative.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZGE2NzlmMzVhYTRiODM4MWIxMTE1ZGE1OTQ3ZTll"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Plans change. So do we." Lorna drew her marble white 10mm Magnum with fluid precision. "Get the car started. I'll buy us time."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MDk3NzAyMGViZDQ4YjliYTg5MzMwOTQ2OWU1ODg0"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Before Xin could protest, Lorna had positioned herself behind the cypress tree, weapon ready but not yet firing. Her posture shifted subtly—no longer the casual visitor but a predator, coiled and deadly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmM2M3NmViMGUxNjQzNmM5ODAwNjZlM2NjOTg3Zjdj"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">The drone's speaker crackled to life, its message in heavily accented English: "ATTENTION! REMAIN WHERE YOU ARE FOR IDENTITY VERIFICATION."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZDAyYTI0OTFhNjQ1YmE5NDk1NjZkZmRiMTQzMmE1"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin's heart hammered against his ribs as he finally bypassed the ignition sequence. The car hummed to life, its fusion-powered engine nearly silent — a small mercy. He glanced up to see a second drone emerging from behind the trees.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZjhiMGM4NWFlMDQ4YTFiYTVhZmQwNjA3YmQ0MGJh"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Lorna," he called in warning, his voice barely audible.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZjUyNWNmNzE1YTQxNmFhZGI1ODA3ZjMyOTAxY2Y0"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">She was already moving, firing a single shot that hit the first drone's optical sensor. As it faltered, she sprinted to the car, sliding in with practiced ease.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYjA4Mjg1MjMzZDQ2ODBiY2Y4MzcyY2U5NjY5OTE4"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Drive," she commanded. "Stay below twenty kilometers per hour until we reach that alley—drones are programmed to prioritize high-speed targets."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YmVmNzMxNDVkYzRjY2U5ZjU5ODg3N2EyZjVlZTQ2"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Counter-intuitive," Xin muttered, forcing himself to ease off the accelerator despite every instinct screaming to floor it. His knuckles turned white on the steering wheel as he maintained the painfully slow pace. "But...now it makes sense. Slower vehicles blend with civilian traffic patterns."</span></p>
<p class="cnMyMGI5MjJkZTY5ZjRjYzhhMjI4NjBmNzNjZTg3YzBh"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Exactly." Lorna kept her weapon ready, eyes constantly scanning their surroundings. "Head east two blocks. Is there another way to the Starport?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZGFmMTdkYWI4OTRlNjViNTVmYmEyMmUyOGY1NjU0"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin's mind raced through the mental map he'd built over years of clandestine meetings. "There's a maintenance tunnel that connects to the old subway system. My uncle used to take it when he needed ammunition from his contacts off-world. It'll take us toward the starport, but underground."</span></p>
<p class="cnM2OWM3ZTZiMmY1ZDRlZDJhNmU1NjcxYmY5N2I0YzBh"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Perfect," Lorna said. "Do it, Xin."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MzgzN2U2N2U3YTQxMmQ5MzIxNDNlMWUzM2E0ODlj"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"As you say." Following his own knowledge, Xin drove through increasingly narrow alleys until they reached an inconspicuous entrance partially hidden behind what appeared to be an abandoned noodle shop.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzI3MDRhNzM3ZDQ0YjM4MzAxOWVmOWI1OGI0Mzhj"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Huh. Secret entrance?" Lorna asked as they approached the sealed barrier.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOTQwNWQ2NmFhNDRkYWQ5OTY2NTAyMjA0YTMxNzY2"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yep." Xin's fingers danced across his Quantum Watch, the holographic interface projecting briefly as he input a series of codes: '5_t6fu/_sul3'.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OGRhZGE4NzEzMTRiNzg5ZDA3YjhiNTk3M2I3MjBk"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">The barrier slid open with a pneumatic hiss.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYTNhNGRmMzE0MzRjZWJiMTg3NDYxNTk5NTMwNzE1"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"There you go," he let out a relieved sigh. "This code has worked since my uncle's days."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MjhlNzVlMzNjMjRmOGFiNTJiYTYzODFmYzhmYjA5"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">The tunnel engulfed them, darkness broken only by the car's headlights and the soft glow of Xin's watch. The passage was tight, clearly not designed for vehicles, but his compact car just barely fit with centimeters to spare on either side.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlY2U3MjAxNGYxYTQwYTBhYzc4NmM2Y2ViZGIzMjE0"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Didn't expect the local resistance to have something this sophisticated," Lorna said, finally holstering her 10mm Magnum as the barrier sealed behind them. "The Constitutional Republic, right? Got a stronghold somewhere?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NjAwZmU2OWZjMjRmZDI4NjZhYWQwZjFhOTAyZGMx"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"I wish I knew. My uncle never told me where or how his comrades operate," Xin replied, carefully navigating the narrow tunnel. "Back when the Sand Lotus still helped them, they were the only ones who could fight the Imperium. After the executions, most people lost hope. Some prayed that maybe one day the Terra Alliance would wise up and aid us like the old United States used to."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMmExM2NkZWJiZjQ3MDlhMTM3NzEzNjA1NWZhZGY3"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"You mean the government that ruled the middle part of Alliance territory in pre-fusion times?" she asked.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNjljODU0YjA4ZTQ5MjNiNTcxZjBjMWVjMzdkMzFl"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Yeah, that. Heard they had democratically elected presidents and all that. Every citizen could vote. Can you imagine how nice it must've been?" he replied.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMjNhOTg3NzUwOTQyMThiYmNkYmRkOTEwNDFjODQz"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Can't imagine," she shrugged. "But I guess the President being nominated by the Corporate Chamber is better. Prevents populists from destabilizing the government."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMjczMGM3MzE5YTRjYjY5N2IyNWU1NzU5Y2VkMTQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Hmm. To each their own."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ZTE2OGZiMWJkNDQ4ZDdiMjhiZjJkNDhhZTQ5NjIw"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">A minute passed without another word. He was acutely aware of her watching him drive—those piercing blue eyes studying his movements. His earlier fear was gradually being replaced by something else—a strange pride in being able to contribute something valuable.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxOTcxZGE4M2MyNzQxN2ViMmVlNGZkYjQ1MWIyZDBj"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"You know," Lorna said, breaking the silence, "most tech specialists I've worked with would be falling apart by now. You're handling this well."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlM2Q0M2UxZTk5MTQ4YTE5NDEzMTUzN2Y2NjU2ODU1"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">Xin let out a short laugh. "Trust me, I'm terrified. But terror's been my baseline for years working at ZenFusion."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDBkODlhNzEzNDQ2ZDJhZjAyNmY1OWY3ZmUxYjBh"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"So no military background helped with that?"</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMzJkODViZjc0ODQyZDU4ODIzZmM2ZWVlMTQyNGZh"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"There was a mandatory service. Every man in the Imperium must serve," Xin admitted. "Communications unit. I was stationed at a desk most of the time, but even desk jobs in the Imperial Legion teach you how to function under pressure." He navigated a particularly tight turn, the vehicle's sides nearly scraping the tunnel walls. "What about you? SIMU training must be intense."</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOWUzMzU5MTE3NDQ0NWU4YmEyMGNiNjFjNGQ5ZDAx"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"They throw us into crisis situations from day one," she replied. "High-speed pursuits, zero-g combat, psionic duels. The list goes on."</span></p>
<p class="cnM1YTk1ZmZjMmYwNDRiMjA5YjQ2NDQyMjNkYmI0NTY4"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Wow. Wish I was part of that." he said.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5ODFhOTQ0NzVlNTRmYmFhZmY4MGIxNDU1MDI0ZGFi"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"It's not as fun as the Atomic News Network makes it." she replied.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YzcyZDhjNzI0NTQxYjA4MGU4YmI0YjBmMDFkZWU2"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">The tunnel began to widen as they approached its end, light filtering in from ahead. Xin checked his watch, bringing up a schematic of their position.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyY2IwZGFlYjQ2ZTQ2YzJiNjBlYmI4NmJmMzAyZmVl"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"We'll emerge about two kilometers from Songnei's southern entrance," he explained. "Less surveillance there. Mostly maintenance and supply deliveries."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMmEzNzU3ZTdlMTRkMzdhOTNiODM5NDZjMTljMmJj"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">They emerged onto a service road that would take them directly toward the starport. In the distance, its spires gleamed in the morning sun.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiNDBmOGFkZWViNjRkYjk4YjQ2YWQ4MjQxZDdiYWRm"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"You're not what I expected, Xin," Lorna said quietly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMjEwYmMxZDVhMDRjOGM4MWVhZjE3ZGQyNWJlYzgz"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva">"Hey, I'm glad you think so." he scratched his head shyly.</span></p>
