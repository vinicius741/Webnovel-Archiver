<p class="cnM5ZmRkNzUyZmFmODQ5MzRiZDcyY2I4YzRhYTQyMjhj" style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 1.1em"><strong>Aria</strong></span></p>
<p class="cnM4OTUyOGY5MTAzNDQ3ZmNiNDUxNGE0N2I1MWYxYjZi">I narrow my eyes as I walk into my suite at the headquarters of the Pale Mercenaries just to find Little Blue playing with the twins.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZGRlNjU0MjkyOTQwY2ZhMjAyMmQzZTllNWM5MDBl">Seriously?</p>
<p class="cnNhZWFlOTY0Y2Q0ODQ1NDU5NTIzM2VjYTI5M2IwZTUy">“Oh, hey Aunty! You finally finished all of that paperwork?” Little Blue asks with a wide and rather smug smile on her face even as Ryan sits in her lap playing a videogame on one of the latest game consoles. Meanwhile Ruby sits nearby petting Asher, with the immortal cat sitting in her lap purring away.</p>
<p class="cnMyNjExM2JkOTFlZDQ0NDA5NDMxNjIwNmU1M2FkNjRm">“Yes, I did,” I grumble as Ruby and Ryan both notice my appearance and get up to go hug me. Ditching Little Blue in the process and making her pout like the child I know she is, even if she won’t admit it. “And just in time too. Their entry ceremony is the day after tomorrow, right?”</p>
<p class="cnM3YmEwMDI5MGI3YTQ0OGI4Zjc0YWE2YjA0ZWFiYjUz">Little Blue continues staring at the kids who are hugging me – with Asher still in Ruby’s arms as she does so – before she answers, “You’re right. But I wasn’t going to make you do paperwork during the ceremony anyways. You could’ve just finished it afterwards.”</p>
<p class="cnM0MmNiZmMxZjlhNjQzM2Q4NWZlM2E5NzFmNGE3NThh">I raise a brow at that.</p>
<p class="cnNmZDlmNTlhYWJjZTQ4YzdhNWYxZjAwZGYxYmM3Mjg4">But then I wouldn’t be able to go into the Hunter’s Bay to join the Death Spirits I’ve had fighting down there this whole time, now would I?</p>
<p class="cnM3ZWFjM2Q0NDg5MjQ1MDZiNDg2MTY3YjMzODc5YTdi">Of course, I don’t say this out loud. But still.</p>
<p class="cnNkZWI5YmJjMWYzYTRmM2RiMDY4ZGVjOTFmZjVhOGIy">I pick up the twins, one in each arm despite how big they’ve gotten at this point, before moving over to the couch next to Little Blue. At which point both kids lean to me with Ruby closing her eyes to sleep and Ryan continuing to play his video game.</p>
<p class="cnMwMjg4MTMxNjA0YjRlN2Y4NzhmZWY5YzRiZDc3NDI1">After a brief glance at his game, I find a smile stretching across my face.</p>
<p class="cnNmZjkxODhjMTViZDQ4NmE5OGQ3NDlmZDYyZGU5Mjdi">It’s the one I showed him. The one where you hunt monsters and raise your hunting rank while using their materials to make better gear to be able to hunt stronger monsters.</p>
<p class="cnM4YzJiOTY0M2ZjNzQ5MWViNWQwNzQ4MmM5YmYxOGQ3">I rather like the game myself, even if I tend to prefer reading over gaming.</p>
<p class="cnM0OTgxYWUyM2Q1YTQ0N2JiM2JhNmQ1MWI4OGIyYjcx">That said… I glance at Little Blue to find her smiling at the sight of me and the kids. But I ignore that as I ask, “You sure they’ll be alright at this academy?”</p>
<p class="cnNmYjkxNGI0M2E3MTQxYTQ5OGEyMjU1ZWU2NmU3NTk2">From what I’ve been told, the Eternal Academy is <em>the </em>place for royals all around the universe to go to. And while they <em>are </em>technically royals as well, I’m not so sure…</p>
<p class="cnM0OGQxMWJiNGVhNTRlZjk4MzExM2VlMzUzNjU3ZGY4">“You worried?” Little Blue says, sounding rather amused at the sight of me being worried for some kids. Even if said kids are my adopted ones. “Don’t be. No one would ever pick a fight with the children of the Horseman of Death herself. Especially not after the war we just won.”</p>
<p class="cnM4YjkwZDU4YmFhMTQyYmE5MDA4MWU2MThjNjgyODc3">Hmm…</p>
<p class="cnNhYmMwZmFlODkzMjQ5OGU5OGIzN2NjN2I5ZDE0N2Nk">I stare at the kids for a while before muttering, “Okay.”</p>
<hr/>
<p class="cnM1YWMwODg3MmE2MTRhOTFiNGI3ODA4ZjJlNzk2ZDcw">“Aria!” Shirogane exclaims as he appears in front of the headquarters, stepping out of his limousine hover car. “It’s great to see you again!”</p>
<p class="cnMyODExNWFjMWJjMTQzMjg5MjU3ODAwNGRiNjg1NzNh">I smile back at him before we share a brief hug, following which he kneels down and pats both Ryan and Ruby on the head. Something Ryan smiles and laughs at while Ruby just looks embarrassed.</p>
<p class="cnNkZjRiOGY1ODgxYjRjZjlhZmU5NTI3ZThhNTBiY2Ni">“And it’s good to see you two little ones again as well!” Shirogane says with a smile on his face. Then he stands up again and motions for us to enter his vehicle. “Let’s catch up a bit before we arrive at the academy!”</p><span class="cmNhZDUyZjA5MzZjNDQ4YmE5NjRhZDdjZGFiNjU1YWE0"><br/>Stolen from its original source, this story is not meant to be on Amazon; report any sightings.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM4OTc2YmEzMmU5ZDQxNWRiMjU3ODEwZGY3ZTJiZDRk">I nod my head in agreement as the four of us all sit down in the vehicle with what’s honestly <em>faaaar </em>too much extra room in said vehicle. But he’s a prince, and all things considered, I go around in what’s pretty much a massive battleship almost on my own all the time. Except maybe a couple other people.</p>
<p class="cnNlODU0ZGM4YWQyYjQ1YjE4MDUzNDNmZDhjZTA0NjVm">So I guess I’m not one to talk about excessive luxury.</p>
<p class="cnM5NWY4MDRkYzNiZDQ3N2ZhZTJhMGUxZDkwZjQ5NDE1">After we get in the vehicle, the two of us begin to catch up on things again. What with him not having the time to do so the last time we saw each other. When I requested for the kids to be put in this academy in the first place.</p>
<p class="cnMxOGQxYjNkZDE3MTQ5OWNhMzE5ZWIwNDlkNzY3Y2Fh">And just like that, the next ten or so minutes fly by almost instantly before we arrive at a massive floating island. Albeit one that’s built like it could be a military fortress.</p>
<p class="cnMyYTE4NmRjNjQ2NzRiNmViOWVlMWFkMTRiNTVlYzI3">But we all ignore the normal parking area that everyone else seems to be going to in order to fly straight into a private hangar. Then the four of us – along with dozens upon dozens of invisible guards scattered all around the place, both for me and for Shirogane – head towards the central building. At which point we step onto a medium-sized teleport pad that brings us into the Eternal Realm.</p>
<p class="cnM0N2Q3MTFjMzhlMzRlNWE5ZGQ3NTg5N2FjNTAxNWUy">I look around with more than a little awe at the place. Simply because it’s so massive and looks like another world all on its own.</p>
<p class="cnM1NzllODIyYzhjMDQwNjY4YTg3Y2MyODdiODI5MzBh">The Eternal Realm is a separate dimension space made for the Eternal Academy itself. One that is pretty much the size of a continent and is all meant just for the academy and nothing else.</p>
<p class="cnM5YzZiOGM2NTc0NzQ0M2U4MDUzNDNkMmMxYTUwYzRk">Every last person inside of it is either a student or related to a student. Generally their guardian.</p>
<p class="cnM3MGQ4YjE2MTJlZDRiYjhiNWMwMmFmYTI3NDQ3NWQ2">Fighting is prohibited in the Eternal Realm by the Eternal Dynasty’s law, and no one ever breaks this law. Simply because the Eternal Academy is known as the foremost gathering place of knowledge in the entire universe. With the only exception being the Arcadian Society’s collection of magical knowledge and the Rex Dynasty’s science.</p>
<p class="cnM1NDk1NmUzOTM5MjQxNjVhYTQ2NDMyMzM5YjgxOWM4">And even those have a place here as they often come here for knowledge exchanges.</p>
<p class="cnNkYjRhMDM1ZTYzYzQxODhhZjA4ZWYzMjcyMDE2Njk3">The place looks largely like a massive city, to be honest. With the only places that are more open being the actual grounds of learning for the students.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZWRiNGFmYmZhYjRkMjM5YTg1YmVmOGQzYzc2ZWY0">The main academy grounds as people call it.</p>
<p class="cnNhYzI1NWNlYjMyZTRhMDhhODk4MjVkNGJmMmZiZjZk">Sure the students can learn pretty much anywhere in the academy so long as they pay using credits to take a class, and anyone can give a class for credits, but that doesn’t change the fact that it’s an academy made by the Eternal Dynasty. And therefore it has a main complex.</p>
<p class="cnM1YmYwMjYxZWM2ZjQ0MjY4OTRlYmU2MTg3MmVhNWIy">As for where the four of us appeared? We appeared directly on top of said complex. Probably because it was the crown prince’s personal entrance or something like that.</p>
<p class="cnNkNTY0ZDAwYzgyOTQyNzI4YTQ5MzYxY2Y2OTIxNWJj">And when we look down at the massive aquastone – a faintly glowing blue stone found underwater and used for underwater lighting – field in front of the main buildings, we all find a massive crowd of people. All of whom are either students or their guardians.</p>
<p class="cnM2YTM3MDk0ZDk0YzRhOGViYjdkMTRiYjBmODYyZjU3">No bodyguards are allowed in here, so none of them came.</p>
<p class="cnM1MmEyNWE1MzQ1NjQyNzdiYTE2YjM1ZTkyY2ZiNGNh">Except for Shirogane’s guards, of course. Since he’s the crown prince of this place.</p>
<p class="cnNhNDE5MWFlOWNlYjRiN2I5MmE2MmZjNmJkMWExOGMx">Not that they’re visible though. What with them still using cloaking technology and magic. Or just their own abilities.</p>
<p class="cnM3NWU5ODdkODc4MzRkYmFiNzFhMTA3Mjc4OTJhZjAx">What’s more interesting though is that I recognize a lot of the people down there from TV. Although who each of them are is beyond me, seeing as I don’t pay attention to that stuff. I just know I’ve seen their faces before.</p>
<p class="cnM4ODZkNmIwMzhlMzQ4NWFhNTJkOTRkZjA3MWFkMGJi">Which makes sense, seeing as this is an academy for royalty all across the universe.</p>
<p class="cnM2YWFjNTI0YmYwNzRhYjJhYzgyZDU5NzhjNGY5MWNl">Just royalty.</p>
<p class="cnM4YWM0NzgzNzJkYjQ3YjQ4Y2I5OTBlNTgyMmMwNWEy">No one but royalty.</p>
<p class="cnMxYWM1NDY1OWQ1ZTQwMGZhZTc5MGRhZWI0MTU3ZjU0">And there are millions of planets across the universe, with millions of royal families.</p>
<p class="cnMzZGNlNDkyYzQ2YjRkZjc5YzcxMGQ4ZjhlN2QxYjNl">Even if only two thousand students are allowed to attend the academy per grade. Making a total of ten thousand for the entire school with their five grades.</p>
<p class="cnMzMDA0MmNlZTRmYTQ4MWE5YTdhNGFiNGQ0NmQyOWI3">The exact place we appeared was actually not too far back from the edge of the ceremonial pedestal. On a large ledge located close to the top of the building looking out over the field. So our arrival is instantly noticed by the people on the field.</p>
<p class="cnNkNDVkMjU0MDhkNzQzYWQ5M2Q5MzgzMGUyNmI1N2E1">To my surprise though, neither Ruby nor Ryan seem to feel shy at all about their looks. In fact, they seem completely unfazed and even a bit apathetic about them.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZTZjYzMyNDE4MDRkMDZhNWVhYjE0ZGNmOWMwNmU2">I feel more than a little proud and smug at that, knowing that they’re taking after me.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZjIxYTJjNDgxMjRmNTliZWRkMTQ0NDBlMzAzOTUy">Shirogane, on the other hand, just sends me a glance as if questioning how I’m raising them.</p>
<p class="cnM1YzU5ZjM0ZjRiMTQ5ZDVhZDc0ZGE5OWZlZWFiZDlh">I ignore his look before picking the kids up and jumping down from the ledge to join the others down below. Seeing as we aren’t actually staff or anything here. And they’re new students too.</p>
<p class="cnNhNTg0YWE2NjVjYzRkM2Y4NWJhMTE1NjNhYjBlNWQy">Of course, this attracts even more attention from the royals gathered below. But the moment they see my face, I can’t help but raise a brow at the fear and terror they all show. Mixed in with a good bit of respect too, but still a lot of fear and terror.</p>
<p class="cnNkMTlhNjQ2ZTNhNDRlYjk4ZmI0Mzk5YjAzYThkMTNl">The three of us eventually settle with me putting the kids down at the very front right edge of the field to get a good view but not be at the center and surrounded from behind by everyone to gawk at.</p>
<p class="cnM2MzkwNTBlZDBmMzQ0NGU4ODI1MWNjYzVlOGU4NGNi">Then Shirogane and the headmaster of the academy both step onto the stage to begin the ceremony.</p>
