   “The ZRC was cleaning up a loose end,” Terrance asserted darkly. “It’s the only thing that makes sense.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   It was the morning after their infiltration, and Maeryn had just finished filling in Dan, Frankie and Peter on what had happened the previous night. Terrance had already finished forging Parlor’s report, which sat at the edge of the table. He’d needed to study the handwriting for most of an hour, practicing it on a few spare sheets of paper, but the finished product was neatly set aside, folded in an envelope, ready for delivery to the royal family.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   That said, it was the last thing on anyone’s minds after the revelation of an Undead in the Camlus house. “Assuming that Ernesto was right, that Camlus was the benefactor for the Airspire facility while they were attempting to make those Mist bombs, then he was a liability twice over. Once for the facility, and once for what happened to Parlor. The ZRC knows that we know about the first, and we’re directly linked to the second. I would bet good money that they were trying to remove any traces of their cooperation.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Then we got incredibly lucky getting in when we did,” Maeryn muttered in conclusion, her voice tight with the knowledge of just how close they’d come to near-certain death. “If we’d gotten there any later, we’d have been facing a necromancer and Undead in tight quarters. And I really don’t like those odds.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   She received a round of nods, but then Ernesto spoke up. “I’m more concerned about the necromancer and Undead that showed up at the end. It was one thing when they kept Keith around—Keith had no desire to do anything but read in his room—but this… this is too much.” His fists clenched as he looked down. “They used a necromancer as a hitman, and an Undead was let loose into someone’s home.” Ernesto shook his head violently, raising his gaze to look determinedly at Maeryn. “They can’t get away with this. They just can’t. How do we stop them? What’s our next step?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn nodded at him, recognizing his feelings and doing her best to non-verbally affirm that she felt the same. “There’s only one thing we can do,” she said, glancing around at her comrades. “We have the forged report. We have our experiences, and Terrance’s standing as a Nightshade. It’s time to go talk to the royal family.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Silence filled the room for several seconds.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “... And… how do we do that?” Frankie asked.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn slumped. “I have no idea. Terrance? How do we meet the royal family?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Why are you asking me?” he questioned incredulously. “How many times do I have to tell you, I was eight when everything went wrong! I never met any of them!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Could we just… like… ask the Council of Winds or something?” Peter asked uncertainly. “See if there are ways to make an appointment?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Dan lifted his finger as if to lecture Peter, then lowered it, clearly having thought better of whatever he was going to say. “You know, I think that might actually work? As long as the Council isn’t entirely in the ZRC’s pocket, it makes sense to try to go through local bureaucracy…”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn rubbed her forehead, trying to stave off a headache. “So, after all the mystery, intrigue, and downright illegal activities we’ve been involved in… you think the best course of action is to go sit in line at the government’s office and hope for the best.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I mean… unless you have a better idea?” Terrance challenged.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Ugh. By the Unending Depths, this is going to feel really anticlimactic if it works…”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Frankie chuckled. “After everything we’ve been through, maybe we deserve an anticlimactic win.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Dan nodded, a faint smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. “It might be nice for something to go our way without a fight for once.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn sighed, a small smirk breaking through her frustration. “Alright then. Let’s give it a shot. Who knows? Maybe we’ll get lucky.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “And now you’ve jinxed it,” Frankie groaned. “Dan, get ready to break her out of prison. It’s her turn to get captured.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn’s jaw dropped. “I… You…” Then an unwilling chuckle escaped her. “You know what? That’s fair.” She rose from the table and stretched. “Alright then. No point in waiting, I suppose. Come on, Terrance.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Wait, why am I going?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Because you’re a Nightshade, they’re more likely to listen to you, and if I’m going to be bored waiting for an hour or two sitting on my butt, then I refuse to be bored alone,” Maeryn answered frankly, grabbing his arm and forcibly dragging him out of his chair.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Wait! That’s not fair! Maeryn, come on, they probably won’t even get us to the royal family today…” Terrance’s complaining settled into disgruntled mutterings even as he grumpily picked up his forged report and followed the hunter out the door.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Have fun!” Frankie chirped. Terrance made a rude gesture at her, and she just started cackling in response.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   As they started trudging down the street towards the Council of Winds headquarters, Terrance leveled a halfhearted glare at Maeryn. “Forced to endure government bureaucracy. There are lines you don’t cross. Conventions universally accepted across Geovan and Zephyrian bounds. I’m pretty sure this is a war crime, actually.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn couldn’t help the chortle that escaped her at Terrance’s exaggerated frustration. “A war crime, you say. And you were going to make me suffer it all alone? For shame.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Hey! No twisting my words against me!” Despite his words, a grin cracked through Terrance’s attempt to stay grumpy. “I’m just saying, you’re dragging a rogue into the light of day and forcing him to wait on government assistance. It’s unnatural. Cruel and unusual.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Ah, I see how it is. You prefer your dark and broody corner?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance mockingly gasped, dramatically holding a hand against his heart as though Maeryn had stabbed him. “Broody?
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Broody
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   ? I am shocked! Shocked and offended!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   They continued their banter all the way to the Council of Winds building, and Maeryn felt incredibly refreshed by the end. She hadn’t realized how much she’d missed having little fun moments like this.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   They sat down quietly in the lobby, waiting for their turn. After a moment, Terrance playfully nudged her. “War crime.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn had to bite her tongue to keep from laughing out loud. After she was finally able to quit shaking with mirth, she nudged him back. “Broody.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance bit his lip, trying to keep a straight face, but his eyes twinkled with suppressed laughter.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   While neither of them said anything else, their shared amusement was more than enough to pass the time. Finally, some time later—it couldn’t have been more than twenty minutes, but Maeryn hadn’t exactly been counting—they were called forward, and the two of them headed towards the back.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   It wasn’t Maeryn’s first time in this room; last time, though, the nine desks had been filled by members of the Geovan terrorist group, led by Gwen and Erina. This time, there were nine completely unfamiliar faces, and Maeryn had no idea about any of them.
  </span>
</p>
<span>
<br/>

  <br/>
</span>
<p>
<span>
   “You’re a new face,” the woman in front of her remarked. “Who are you, and what can we do for you two?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance took a half-step back, clearly letting Maeryn do the talking. Fine with her. “I am Captain Maeryn, of the airship Stonewing. I have news regarding the recent murder of Samuel Parlor… and a document written by the man, intended for the royal family. Their eyes only. It seems that he was a retainer, and he left a copy of the report with us as an insurance policy. I seek an audience with the royal family, to deliver his report.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   There was a rush of murmurs from the various council members, and much to her disbelief, Maeryn caught one of them muttering, “Where’s her hat, then?” Maeryn’s fist clenched. That damned hat was haunting her! She was here about
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    murder
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   , and they were asking about her Depths-be-damned hat?
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance, obviously hearing the same remark, nudged her with a knowing look. She leveled the best glare she had at him, and scowled as Terrance’s lips twitched upwards in clear amusement.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   After a few moments the spokeswoman cleared her throat pointedly, calling for silence. “That’s quite a claim. Have you any evidence?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn grimaced, but shook her head. “None that you’d accept, I fear. I would hope that my knowledge that he was a retainer would be enough. If I wasn’t afraid of letting his report be accidentally misplaced before making it to the royal family, I’d offer to have the handwriting analyzed.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “That’s quite an insulting accusation, young lady,” one of the men on her right scolded. “We would never lose such an important document.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn raised an eyebrow at him. “Considering that the report supposedly indicts the ZRC, and that the ZRC attempted to detain my crew unlawfully and still hasn’t been punished for it, I have my doubts.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   This time, her words created an actual uproar as half the council members leapt to their feet, yelling over each other, their voices overlapping into a chaotic and indecipherable stream of syllables.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Enough!” the spokeswoman roared, slamming her hands on her desk for extra emphasis. “Sit down, all of you! We will discuss this calmly, or you shall be recused from this session!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   There was a final grumble, but everyone reluctantly sat back down.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Now then, Captain Maeryn. Explain yourself.” The spokeswoman leaned forward intently.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Which part?” Maeryn asked plainly.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Start from the beginning.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Fine. I met Samuel Parlor on Airspire, responding to a transport request. He wanted passage to and from Zephyr. Along the way, he discovered my crewmate, Terrance.” She glanced at him, and received a reluctant nod. “Terrance Nightshade.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Wait. The Nightshade family?” An old man on Maeryn’s left exclaimed. “Young Terrance? You survived?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “With a healthy dose of luck, yes,” Terrance confirmed, stepping forward to stand next to Maeryn. “Samuel Parlor recognized me—apparently there’s a family resemblance—and decided to entrust a copy of his report with me. He confided that my family had been retainers to the royal family before they passed, and asked me to deliver his report should something happen to him.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “And something did happen to him,” Maeryn continued, picking up the story. “He died the day after we arrived in Zephyr. I was then called into interrogation by the local guard, where the interrogator learned that my crew and I slew an Undead on Airspire… in a hidden ZRC facility.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “You lie! The ZRC would never work with necromancers or the Undead!” a woman on her right called out with an ugly expression.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I was seated at a table enchanted to react to falsehoods,” Maeryn replied pointedly, narrowing her eyes at the woman. “My interrogator accepted it as truth and put it in her report. Check the records yourself if you don’t believe me. In any case, I was then informed that my crew had been grounded by royal decree for my connection, however tangential, to Parlor’s murder.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Wait. You’re
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    that
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   Captain Maeryn? I thought the name sounded familiar,” the spokeswoman commented.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “That’s me. Anyway, I spent the rest of the day looking for new accommodations for my crew, and then returned to the hotel that Parlor had been providing for us. That was when I learned that my crew was missing, and received a note from my interrogator advising me that the ZRC had learned of our involvement with slaying the Undead in Airspire.” Maeryn’s face hardened in remembered fury. “I, ahem, questioned the receptionist, and he was kind enough to tell me that my crew had been escorted out by the ZRC under accusations that one of my crew was a necromancer. I… Well, to be frank, I took matters into my own hands.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “The disturbance at the ZRC headquarters…” the old man from before breathed. “That was you?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “That was me,” Maeryn confirmed.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “You did that? Alone?” a portly man on Maeryn’s right sneered derisively.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn raised her arm and casually extended the blade on her vambrace with a sharp
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    shink
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   . “Yes. Would you like a demonstration?” she asked icily.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The portly man went pale and promptly shut his mouth.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Nodding, Maeryn retracted her blade again and looked back at the spokeswoman. “Since obviously my crew wasn’t safe at the hotel, we went into hiding. We can’t leave while our airship’s grounded, after all. But since Parlor asked Terrance here to deliver his report… Well, here we are. So. Can you get us a meeting with the royal family or not?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   There was some nervous shifting from the members of the Council, and the spokeswoman looked distinctly uncomfortable. “I mean… technically… But, well…”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Let me guess,” Terrance interrupted, a resigned expression on his face. “While you technically have the authority to ask for a meeting with the royal family, it has to go through some middleman to ensure you’re not wasting the royal family’s time. And it so happens that the middleman is either hard to reach, or in the ZRC’s pockets.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The spokeswoman slumped at her desk. “I’m afraid so.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance turned to look at Maeryn. “Great. This whole thing was useless, and now a bunch of people know who I am. Now what, fearless leader?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn didn’t look at him; no, she was staring at the defeated form of the spokeswoman, and rapidly feeling her anger spike as she was faced with yet another form of government incompetence. “No. No, we’re not doing this today. You are not going to make me do your blighted, Depths-damned jobs for you! Not again!” Maeryn stepped off the podium she’d been speaking from and stalked over to the desk in front of the spokeswoman. “You have another option. One you’re not telling me,” she hissed. “Tell me, or I swear by every single wind in the sky that I’m just going to burn this place to the ground.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The spokeswoman’s face paled dramatically, clearly able to tell that Maeryn was dead serious. “W-We do have s-something, for dire emergencies, b-but…”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn planted both of her hands on the spokeswoman’s desk, and felt the mana within her ignite. It was ready to consume the desk, ashes and all, if she gave it permission. She held it back. For now. “Tell. Me.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   But instead of the spokeswoman, it was the old man who spoke up. “There’s a broach, gifted to us by the royal family. Anyone who wears it is accepted as speaking for the Council of Winds as a whole… and is granted permission to enter the palace and seek an audience with the royal family without delay. It requires a unanimous decision from all of us to unlock the case it’s in.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Sounds perfect. Get on with it, then. Pick a representative, give them the broach, and let’s get this over with,” Maeryn demanded.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “The problem,” the old man continued as if he hadn’t been interrupted, “is that if the royal family decides that the broach was misused, the wearer will be put to death. It was a decision made in order to ensure that it would only be used in genuine emergencies.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn closed her eyes and took a deep breath, trying to keep control of her temper. She was rapidly losing that particular battle. “And you’re saying that delivering a damning report about the corruption of the ZRC… an organization that we’re all relying on to prevent us from dying and worse to the Mist… showing that they’re dealing with necromancers and the Undead… doesn’t qualify?” she asked slowly, grinding her teeth with rage.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Oh, no, I fully believe it qualifies,” the old man agreed unexpectedly. “I just want you to understand what it is you’re asking for. The kind of risk I’m about to undertake on your behalf.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   His words completely quenched Maeryn’s burning blood, and she blinked amid the sudden murmurs from the other council members. “What?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I will be the Bearer,” the old man announced loudly. “Are there any who would deny me?” After several moments of silence, the old man nodded. “I thought not.” He reached into his desk and extracted a jewelry box, and casually opened it up, pinning an ornate ruby broach onto his vest. “And, there we go. Come along, Captain Maeryn, Terrance Nightshade. Let’s see if I die today.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “... Just like that?” Maeryn asked dumbly. “You… what?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   There was a snort from the portly man that Maeryn had silenced earlier. “That’s Robert Hawks for you,” he muttered. “Fearless, that one. That makes, what, the third time he’s worn it?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Fourth,” a slightly aged-looking woman at the far-right desk corrected mildly, a smile on her face. “See you tomorrow, Robert.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Probably!” the old man agreed chipperly. “After all, I can’t miss your muffins, Anna.” And, completely ignoring the woman’s blushing face, he began briskly walking, leaving the room.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn and Terrance exchanged a single glance before hurrying after him.
  </span>
