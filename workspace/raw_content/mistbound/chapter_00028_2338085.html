<p class="cnM0OTI4MmRlYTY5MDQyOTJiYzZhNWQ0ODE4MmEwYTYz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto’s eyes flitted across the pages rapidly, eagerly consuming every line of his Master’s Compendium. There were thousands of pages, perhaps tens of thousands - he hadn’t counted, not wanting to know how much was left. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkMDE4MzkwYTczNzQ3ZTQ4NDg1NzBiMTRlM2RhZjI4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Very little of what he’d read so far had taught him anything new, but that didn’t make the Compendium any less valuable. The first few dozen pages so far had been autobiographical, a story of how Master Graves had discovered his talent for necromancy, and how he had dedicated his life to understanding the ways that death was just another facet of life, to finding ways to improve the lives of the people by bettering their relationship with the dead. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1MzcxODZjNjRiOTRkODJiMmMwMmUwOTcxNjZiOWQ3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Everything Ernesto read showed that it hadn’t been easy for his Master. Necromancy was forbidden everywhere, because of the calamities that the Undead were capable of. He’d had to learn and explore his talents on his own over the course of decades, lacking any teachers to guide him. But Graves had persisted, using his powers in secret and learning as much as he could, eschewing the idea of ever raising an Undead. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyYjE5ODVhNzk4NjQzM2I5YTE5Y2MxZGEzOTU3OTA2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto turned the page, feeling closer than ever to his beloved Master. He’d never known how very much like Ernesto the man had been when he was young. How afraid he’d been of ever being discovered. How socially isolated he’d been, unable to bear the risk of someone catching him. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwNDJjMDk0MzQ5YzRhYzRiMzZlNWJkZTNhYjJiOGMw"><span style="font-weight: 400">The young necromancer laughed aloud as he reached the point where his Master had been given the designation “Graves” because of his heavy focus on graveyards and the mana around them. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0MjM4NDUxOGFkNDQ3OTdhNmViYmYyMDQzNTk4Nzc1"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">I cannot believe this. They decided to call me Graves. I’m a necromancer named Graves. What am I, some kind of cringey wannabe Dark Lord? Oh, look at me, I’m a big bad necromancer… the Dark Lord Graves! I will never be able to take myself seriously ever again. Or the Research Council, for that matter. The fact that they’ve never discovered what I am is astonishing to me, and I will remember their ineptitude for the rest of my days. </span></em></p>
<p class="cnNhNDg0NzFmZDM0NDRjZGJhZDhjNDZiMTIzOTUzOTcw"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Seriously, though. Graves? There has to have been a better name.</span></em></p>
<p class="cnMwZmQzYzFiZTg0YzQwMzU5OWU0MzE2OWU2ZTQ4OTVl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto chuckled again, turning the page. “Oh, Master… I’d always wondered why you always seemed on the verge of laughing when I asked you about your name.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM1YTkzNmVkYTVlMDRhNTJiNjVlM2FmYjAwOGE5Mjg5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey there. Reading anything good?” Dan asked, stepping into their shared bedroom at the inn. Ernesto hadn’t really left at all, while Dan had gone to run a few errands earlier, leaving him in peace to go through the Compendium. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1YjhjNDdmN2E3ODQ0ZmI4ZGEzODgwNmE4MDczNTg2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“More on my Master’s life story. Given where I’m at, I expect I’ll probably reach the end of his journal entries in another hour or so, perhaps less if he made fewer entries as he grew older.” Ernesto tapped the page he was on twice indicatively. “Nothing particularly relevant to the mission, though. Unless you count the fact that he never met another necromancer, that he knew of anyway.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwYzUwY2RmYTBjYTQxY2E4MTJkNmU3MjdjNmM2ZThj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan nodded in understanding. “Good to know. How’re you holding up?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwNWQ4NDg0OWYxMzQyNTY5NWRmMGM2ZWU4Njg3OWM5"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I, um…” Ernesto lowered the Compendium to properly look at the alchemist. Dan was his boss, and they would need to work together for the mission, he knew that. And Dan had shown a lot of interest in the non-Undead capabilities of necromantic mana, which was amazing! But… he didn’t really feel comfortable confiding in Dan. Not yet. Even if he knew that Dan was trying to make sure they could get along. “I’m doing okay. Coping, I guess. I’ll let you know if I need anything.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNTliNzJkNWNmMzQ4YmM5MjQyNmVmOGI5NDlhM2Qw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Recognizing the dismissal for what it was, Dan nodded quietly and dropped the subject. “I wanted to talk to you about your training needs. We’re assuming that there are spells and exercises in the Compendium, but we still need a place for you to actually practice. I’m not going to pretend to know better than you what you need, so your input would be helpful.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3MDBjNzJhMzUxMTQ2MWI5NjU3ZTU0OWQ0YTNiMDg1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto nodded quietly, placing a bookmark in the Compendium and closing it properly. “Necromancy gives a relatively wide range of abilities,” he said slowly. “Cold, acid and rot can probably be done properly in a lab, or on the surface, so long as I have… organic things to practice on. But spirit work might be tricky. I’ve never done it before. I don’t know if it’s easier to call on the spirits of animals or of humans. I would expect animals to be easier, as they should be less complex, but if there’s intuitive understanding involved then it might be the other way around, you know?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3Y2UxZDczNmFkMjRlOWJhMTQ2YzM3ZTdiMzhkZGI0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I absolutely do,” Dan agreed immediately. “So, we need to be flexible and adapt as needed. But you’re right; wherever we go, organic compounds will be necessary for testing and observation…” He trailed off thoughtfully. “You can probably test cold and acid on inorganic things as well. Perhaps some metals and other samples could prove useful, too.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0OTRlNTdmMzYxNjQyOWViNjY2MzM1ZWE2NjllYzg2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That makes sense to me,” Ernesto acquiesced, his voice quiet. “I’d… I’d prefer to find ways that use my necromancy to improve the quality of life of people, if I can. Like, I can use the rotting nature of its mana to ferment milk into cheese. I can probably make alcohol too, using similar principles. If I could find a way to use the cold aspect of necromancy to, I don’t know, improve food storage or something? I’d like to look into that while we’re training.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1M2FmY2I4YTc3NjQzMzg5NjdiYTFlY2QzOGMzNjg2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan’s face softened, losing some of the far away gaze he’d had a minute ago. “That sounds… really nice, Ernesto. I don’t see why not; the better your understanding of how your mana works, the better the results will be in the end. I’ll help you however I can.” He chuckled ruefully. “Maybe, if your research goes well enough, we could even get our governments to make necromancy not completely forbidden anymore.”</span></p><span class="cjFjYmU4ODAzMjQ5ODQwMGRiNWJkOGU3MmZhN2QwMTFh"><br/>The story has been illicitly taken; should you find it on Amazon, report the infringement.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNmZjdjMTQxZDI4ZjRkNTZhZDEyNWY5OTJiZWYyZGY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto chuckled weakly. “Maybe one day. But that’s a long, long ways off. We’d probably have better luck just making and selling runic devices. As long as we never tell anyone how it works, it’d do okay, I think.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM4YTQ0NTU3ZTdlNTQ3ZTFhNjY4MzY0ZTQzNTJhMTAz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re probably right.” Dan sighed. “That’s what we’re going to have to do when we figure out holy mana, anyway. Once we’ve got something working, you and I are going to be </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">very </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">busy creating runic sequences for Mist purification. It’s not like anyone else will have enough understanding of the principles necessary to invert necromantic mana.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMwOTdlNDUzMmQ4YjQyZWU5ZDdlMDMwZTg4NTZlODc1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh. Ernesto hadn’t even thought of that. Suddenly, his hopes for having just one year of his life being dedicated to saving the world seemed far too optimistic. “Well… it’s not like I’ve ever been afraid of a little hard work,” Ernesto offered weakly.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkNzczZDc0ZmRmMTRkZGZhMTc5M2UwMzIxZGQ2YmQ4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s a good attitude to have,” Dan praised matter-of-factly. “Don’t worry, we’re in it together. And if I know Maeryn, she’ll probably end up joining us midway through or something.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZGNkM2Y0NTQzNTRkY2ZiODFiNGQ4ZTg5Mjc1Njgy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Captain Maeryn? But, why?” the necromance asked, confused. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1NDM2NzM4ZTk1NDRhODM4NjBhM2MxMmNlNDYyNDBm"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That girl does </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">not </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">do well with boredom or being told to wait for someone else to do something,” Dan related with a laugh. “Mark my words, she’ll be here sooner than you think, asking to learn some necromancy from you just so she can feel like she’s contributing. She won’t even care that it’s forbidden by our culture. By the Hearth, she’s amazing and infuriating all at once.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzNmM3MGQxOGYzNjQ5NGQ5NDZlMjhiMGY1NzlmNTUx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite his words, Dan sounded inordinately fond of her, and Ernesto smiled a bit seeing it. “She does seem like quite the girl. How did she end up leading you and Frankie, anyway?”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZDI5YzMwMWZjMTQ4ZWFhNzJiZWVmZmM4MzgzZjJh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan snorted. “Couldn’t tell you how Frankie joined her - that was before I joined up - but… you see, Maeryn was a hunter. The weapons she uses, she made them herself. Including the runic sequences. But guess who was the one tasked with teaching her those runes?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YTE0Zjk5MmQxNTRjMWJiMWQ1MjM4M2Q1ODFiMjE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You?” </span></p>
<p class="cnMxNWZhOGFkOWM2NzQ2MjRiMjgwYmExMGQ5Y2RjMjNh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Me,” Dan confirmed. “One of those things that the more learned alchemists liked to do in order to make sure newbies knew our stuff well. Something about teaching allowing for greater understanding. Anyway, so I was stuck teaching Maeryn the runes, their meanings, and all that. And somehow we got on the topic of the Mist and our mana barriers. We got into this whole argument about mana efficiency and how the expected timeline before Critical Mana Depletion - the point where mana is too thin to power the mana barriers, letting the Mist in,” the alchemist rapidly explained, seeing Ernesto’s confused blink. “Anyway, the estimated timeline kept changing. Maeryn basically drew a graph on </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">my </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">blackboard, lecturing </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">me </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">in </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">my office </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">about how we had much less time than our most recent estimates.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNDgxODA0ZjNkYTRlNGU5ODljNjBjMjdmMGQ5OWQw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan chuckled and shook his head. “I was so mad I threw her out. Then I did the calculations myself, and then I did it again because they matched up with what she’d said and I was convinced I had to be missing something. I spent the next three days looking for something, anything to prove her wrong, and when I walked into my office on the fourth day, she was waiting for me, with her arms crossed and tapping her foot.” He began laughing quietly. “She, she took one look at me and asked, ‘Are you ready to admit you were wrong yet?’” </span></p>
<p class="cnM4ODg2MDFlYmJiMTRmMmY4NWJjOTE2Mzc5NmIzNzA3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No way,” Ernesto whispered, completely in awe at Maeryn’s audacity. “In your office?” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiYjU2Njk1ZmNkZTRmZDM5MmZhZmE1MGQ0ODA4Yzhh"><span style="font-weight: 400">“In my office!” Dan repeated, unable to keep the grin from his face even as he threw his hands in the air exasperatedly. “So anyway, I sat down, took a look at her, and grumpily asked, ‘If you’re so smart, what’s your plan for dealing with this?’ And then, I kid you not, she took my blackboard </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">again</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> and explained her mad plan for stealing an airship with Frankie, getting the latest research from Zephyria, and next steps based on what we found. She even had plans for if we needed to establish a surface lab for me to run my tests and experiments.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhN2Q3NjNjNzFhNzRmZmFhODM4NzU4NWRhY2FkOWQ2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan let out a heavy sigh, his expression ruefully amused. “Naturally, she had a lot of basic assumptions that weren’t quite right, and I couldn’t help myself. I corrected her plan in about a dozen different areas, and then we ended up having a really spirited debate. And then it happened again when we met up the next week. And the next. And eventually I realized I liked the plans we made more than the directions we were given at the Alchemical Workshop. Maeryn became my leader because she’s the one who lit a fire under me, who really challenged me, and then told me that she believed I could do it. That I could figure out the Mist, and figure out a solution, if I was just given what I needed to do it. And then, by the Unending Depths, she gave me what I needed.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiZmE1MDk3ZTYzZDRhYmM5NjM0NGY5ZWMwMzc5NjIy"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wow.” Ernesto had no words. “That’s… that’s really inspiring, actually.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMwM2E5ZmU2NWI3ZjRmMTFhNWQ2YTY2MWU3MGFjNDRk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah…” Dan let out a long breath, the smile on his face not quite vanishing, but becoming a bit more subdued as he sat down next to Ernesto. “Yeah. That’s Maeryn, alright. She doesn’t like to think of herself as our leader, but that’s what she is. She’s the one who gets us where we need to be, with what we need in order to do what we need to do. And Ernesto? I hope that she can be that for you too.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0MzUxZDVmOGVhODQxMjJiYzFhYmFhNWQyNGY5ODA1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto absorbed the words quietly, considering them. “I mean… I’m here. And if it wasn’t for her, I wouldn’t have made it to see Master before he faded, I don’t think. I’m not ready yet, but… maybe she’ll be to me, what she is to you someday. Maybe someday.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNjOTEzNTg3NDNhMDQ0YjRiYWI2NzQ0OTBjNTU4ZWQx"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe someday,” Dan agreed softly. Then he rose from his spot next to Ernesto. “I’m going to grab a drink from one of the stands outside. You want anything?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM4ZTY0ZGUxYzc0YjQ4YTM4ZWIxMzhjYTZlMWUwMzFj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto was about to give a polite decline, but thought better of it at the last moment. “A lemonade would be great, if you don’t mind.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0YmJmNzc3OTVhODQzMmE5MTAyZWRjYTgxMTcwNDBj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dan smiled at him, gave him a thumbs up, and left without another word. </span></p>
