   <strong>
    Osram Time: 04:14, February 24, 2295
   </strong>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   10,213 miles above Mare Imbrium, Near Side, Osram
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The StarWhale shuttle flew through space, leaving a faint blue trail behind it. Diego handled the controls while Xin and Lorna sat nearby.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Carajo," Diego muttered as he adjusted the controls, watching the radar. "These Sky Shredders are getting bolder. Back in Mexico, we had similar problems with mutated sea creatures near the coastal reactors. Fishermen learned to spot their patterns."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin leaned forward, interested. "And you're using those same techniques here?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Exactamente. Mutated marlins, space monsters, whatever. Predators hunt similarly." Diego's fingers moved across the controls. "My abuelo taught me that before he lost his fishing boat to the Radi-Mons. Now I hunt different kinds of beasts."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin looked out the window where bat-like creatures swarmed. Some scratched at the shuttle, making it vibrate.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I heard the Radi-Mons on Osram are worse than Earth's," Xin said with a shiver before putting on his new beige puffer jacket and navy blue pants from SIMU.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Some are. Sky Shredders are just nuisances though. More growl than bite," Lorna said as she put on her trench coat and attached a small silver device to her ear. The oval gadget hummed with a soft blue light. "Lunae Arcanum Custos."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Some kind of amplifier?" Xin asked, raising an eyebrow. He could barely hear the device over the shuttle engine.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It's a Psi Shield Device. You'll see how it works soon," Lorna replied with a smile.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Through the glass floor, Xin saw a white rover attached to the shuttle's belly by cables. He looked back at Lorna.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Your scar is gone," he said.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna smiled. "Had a good night's sleep. Must have helped."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Soft lights shone on the curved walls, highlighting her navy-blue turtleneck and the silver pendant on her collar as she zipped up.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Órale, we're almost there." Diego said calmly. "Osram was terraformed centuries ago, gracias a Dios, so the air should be like Earth's. Watch out for the low gravity though."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Got it," Xin replied, gripping his 10mm Magnum. He raised his left wrist where his Quantum Watch glowed green. "Wake up, Pawan."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A chirp sounded, and Pawan, his Omni-drone, activated and floated up from his jacket pocket to hover beside him.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He took a deep breath, glancing at Lorna. She tied her blonde hair in a half-ponytail and took out a small bottle of lavender perfume. She sprayed some behind her ears and on her wrists, rubbing them together.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What? Never seen a girl wear perfume before?" Lorna teased, catching him looking.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I might have," Xin admitted, blushing slightly. "But not before a mission like this."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna looked into his eyes. "Close your eyes," she said, and he did.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The scent of her perfume surrounded him as he felt her warm hands on his ears.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   When Xin opened his eyes, Lorna had a clinical expression as she rubbed perfume on the back of his ears.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He blushed deeply. "Uh, feels strange for a guy to wear perfume?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Masks your scent," Lorna explained simply. "Radi-Mons have good noses. They track by smell when they can't see. Different smells confuse them."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin pulled back slightly, embarrassed that he'd misunderstood. Of course it was tactical—he was new to field work. "That makes sense."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Don't worry about it," she replied, looking more professional than friendly. "You'll get used to field protocols and understand your teammates' tactics eventually."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He nodded, mentally scolding himself. The mission. Focus on the mission.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As they got closer to the moon, Lorna took another Psi Shield Device from her pocket. This one was in a clear package, showing a silver oval with a green core. She opened the package, which disappeared after crinkling.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Standard issue," she said professionally. "Green was the only color left." She put the device on Xin's ear efficiently, without warmth, saying, "Lunae Arcanum Custos."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The device vibrated uncomfortably when attached. It wasn't painful but felt invasive—like someone opening a door in his mind. He winced as he felt a strange presence, forming a mental link with Lorna.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You okay?" Lorna asked, noticing his discomfort.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It's... strange," Xin said, resisting the urge to pull it off. "Like you're in my head."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That's normal," Lorna explained clinically. "The devices create a psionic connection so we can coordinate. You'll get used to it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I'd rather not," Xin muttered quietly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I'll use my Aether to maintain both our Psi Shields," she continued, ignoring his discomfort. "If you need to access them—the password is 's-c-h-w-z-K-U-K-21'."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Okay. I've saved it," Xin typed on his Quantum Watch, focusing on the technical aspects rather than the uncomfortable feeling. Then he frowned with concern. "But won't that drain your Aether?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That's my job," Lorna said flatly. "Your job is to learn and become useful to the team."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin nodded stiffly, unsure how to handle this new dynamic. The mental connection felt too intimate yet was apparently standard procedure. He'd have to adapt.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The StarWhale landed on the gray surface of Osram. As the door opened with a hiss, Xin walked forward, surprised by the vast lunar landscape below.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Quite the drop from here!" he said, noticing the height between the shuttle and the moon's surface.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Falling on Osram wouldn't hurt much," Lorna said, her expression blank as she stood behind him. "— if at all."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Before Xin could understand what she meant, he felt her boot push hard against his back. There was no playfulness—just cold efficiency as she shoved him out of the shuttle.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What—!" he fell through empty space, arms flailing. Panic filled him as the ground came closer. Was this a test? Or had he misunderstood something about their relationship?
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Psi Shield hummed on his ear, reminding him of their connection.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   His landing was softer than expected, but still jarring. He got up quickly, turning to face Lorna as she landed gracefully nearby.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "A little warning next time?" he snapped, hurt in his voice. "Or is pushing teammates part of Alliance protocol?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You hesitated," she replied coolly. "In the field, hesitation kills. Better to learn that now than when Radi-Mons are attacking."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Logically, Xin understood the lesson—trust must be earned, especially when lives are at stake.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Well, this is still fun, isn't it?" he said sarcastically, his heart still racing.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A sharp howl suddenly cut through the thin air of Osram. Xin's head turned toward the sound.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Good old Bone Fiends," Lorna said as she landed, her tone darkening. She drew her Psytum Sword, the blue blade humming as it extended.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin landed awkwardly on the powdery surface, kicking up moon dust. He looked toward the horizon where creatures were digging out of the ground.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna moved first, her coat flaring as she ran toward the monsters, sword ready. She called over her shoulder, "Alright! You know what to do."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I do!" Xin gripped his 10mm Magnum tightly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Come on, doggy," Lorna said in a husky voice as she ducked under a Bone Fiend's claws, her sword hissing through the air. The blade cut cleanly through the creature's neck, its head floating as blue energy crackled along the wound.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin jumped, the low gravity making him more agile.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A Bone Fiend lunged at him, its glowing eyes fixed on him. Xin pulled the trigger, the kick of the gun jolting his arm as the bullet went through the creature's skull, spraying dark fluid.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   More Bone Fiends dug out of the lunar surface. Lorna's sword moved smoothly, cutting down anything close.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She spun as she spotted a Skuggr below them. "Passus Transitus!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin's AI-assisted gun hummed as it locked onto targets. Though each calculation took time, making him slower, every shot was more accurate than normal humans could manage. Bone Fiends fell, twitching in mid-air.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Was it you or your AI targeting?" Lorna called out, her voice more critical than impressed. She moved through the air away from him, clearly avoiding his fighting area.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "A bit of both," Xin replied, distracted by her question. "See, I've calibrated it to—"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Focus on the fight, not the tech specs!" she interrupted, turning to three Bone Fiends approaching her.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You're right!" Xin bristled at her tone but held back his response. A Skuggr aimed at him, its twisted face contorting as it shot acidic bile. His Psi Shield activated, turning the deadly attack into green mist—but the shield flickered, the connection with Lorna's Aether weakening.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Shield's unstable," Lorna shouted. "You're too far from my range! Stay within twenty meters!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Understood!" Xin replied, moving closer with frustration. He raised his gun and fired five shots at the monster's head, but three missed, his concentration broken by the tension.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Buddha's balls," he muttered.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "This isn't a simulation, Xin!" Lorna said impatiently as she killed another Bone Fiend efficiently.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Around them, about a dozen more Bone Fiends emerged, surrounding them in a tightening circle. Their glowing eyes locked onto Xin and Lorna, hungry for prey.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Stop waiting for AI calculations and just shoot!" Lorna shouted, watching a group of Radi-Mons coming toward them.
  </span>
 </p>
 <span>
  <br/>
  Stolen from its rightful author, this tale is not meant to be on Amazon; report any sightings.
  <br/>
 </span>
 <p>
  <span>
   Frustration filled him—he wished she'd understand his methods better. But when a Bone Fiend jumped at Lorna's back while she focused on those in front, Xin saw his chance. Without waiting for AI targeting, he fired instinctively.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The bullet hit perfectly, dropping the creature mid-jump.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna turned around, her eyes widening briefly before narrowing with reluctant approval. "Not bad."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Nodding, Xin tapped his Quantum Watch as Pawan floated beside him. The drone's spider-like limbs extended, its green dome scanning the area.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Got an idea," Xin said, more confidently now. "Pawan can boost your Aether output temporarily. Might strengthen your attacks."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It'd weaken our shields and make you vulnerable."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Briefly, yeah. But the monsters would be gone."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna hesitated, clearly cautious. "And if it fails?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Then we're no worse off than now," Xin replied. "Trust me—just this once."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   After thinking for a moment, she nodded. "Do it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Pawan," Xin said, directing the drone toward Lorna. "Psionic feed, ZenFusion type seven."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The drone chirped in response, positioning itself between them. A green light pulsed from its core, connecting to both their Psi Shield Devices. Xin felt the mental link strengthen, the uncomfortable feeling replaced by a stable connection.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna blinked. "That's...better," she admitted, turning to face the remaining Radi-Mons. With better coordination, she cast her spell, the air crackling with energy. "Fulmen Argentum!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The blue lightning struck with amazing precision, jumping between multiple targets and destroying all the Bone Fiends before they could attack. This time, none escaped the devastating chain of energy.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   For a brief moment, their eyes met across the battlefield—not quite friendship, but a hint of respect. A beginning, Xin hoped.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   In the next moment, the ground rumbled as Alliance forces arrived, announced by the whirring of white-blue fusion-powered exosuits.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Vanguard marines," Lorna said over the noise. "Brain isn't their strong suit. But they're good people."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Vanguards were impressive - figures in sleek white armor that shimmered under Osram's pale light. Their Gauss Rifles glowed as they fired round after round of blue energy shots, cutting through the few remaining Fiends with precision.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As more Radi-Mons approached, the ground shook beneath another type of infantry. These huge soldiers wore gleaming white power armor and gas masks with tubes on each side of their heads. Each heavy step thudded against the moon's surface.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin felt heat coming from their weapons as the massive flamethrowers in their hands shot streams of fire at the advancing monsters.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna spoke through the noise. "Ironbears. Tough, heavily armored, with flamethrowers for close combat." She glanced at Xin. "Many were criminals before resocialization. Get behind them when you need protection."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Die, Radi-Mon fuckface!" an Ironbear shouted, raising his massive arm and unleashing flames on a group of Bone Fiends. The creatures screamed as they burned, crumbling into charred remains within seconds.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Sensing defeat, the remaining Radi-Mons retreated into the distance.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin looked toward the massive vault door carved into the hillside. Both the hill and door were enormous. Looking through his glasses, green text appeared: 'estimated height: 10 meters'. The circular stone structure had ancient hieroglyphs near its center.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As they walked on the lunar surface, Lorna put away her sword and headed toward the soldiers, her face sweaty and hair messy from fighting.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Glad to see you in one piece!" Thomas Mendoza emerged from the Vanguards, his bionic arms reflecting sunlight as he approached with a folded Gauss Rifle on his back. "Manny's with the junior Psi Lynxes, scouting the other vault doors."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The other doors? Why?" Lorna asked as she approached, her voice rough from exertion.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It's that data Xin gave us. This is just one entrance to that Vault of — prime something, right?" Thomas replied, pointing to a huge hexagonal door in the hillside. "Director Otis said there are several more on the Near Side. We might need them if this one doesn't work."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin studied the structure. "Have you seen the glyphs on the door? The ones matching the data's description?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yep," Thomas replied. "I understand you have the sequence to unlock it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It's on my watch. Shouldn't take long," Xin said, showing his Quantum Watch.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Alright, let's do it." Lorna nodded as she put her sword away.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   They headed toward the vault door, Thomas leading the Alliance forces - Vanguards in their sleek armor and bulky Ironbears with their flamethrowers.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "If you can watch my back," Xin said quietly, looking between Lorna and the others while checking his watch. "I can figure out the vault door in a few minutes —"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Aguas!" Diego's voice came through the comm, sounding urgent. "Imperium troops have landed in Mare Imbrium. They've brought a major force."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "How many are we talking, Diego?" Lorna turned toward the StarWhale shuttle in the distance, looking concerned as she pressed her ear.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Based on satellite images? Madre santísima — enough to flatten a small moon town," Diego struggled to stay calm. "Director Otis knows. We're contacting the Pentagon. Hold your position until further notice."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The sun hung low on the horizon, casting long shadows across the barren landscape. Xin stood with the Alliance soldiers, watching the approaching Imperium forces, their red armor gleaming like blood in the dim light.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Emmanuel, óyeme bien — abort your mission and return to Descent Point Charlie immediately," Diego said over the comm again.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Roger that. On our way," Emmanuel replied.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin watched the enemy emerge through the dust, a wave of red-clad Bloodtroopers marching in perfect formation. As they charged forward, Xin felt adrenaline rushing through him as he prepared for battle.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Stand firm!" Thomas shouted orders above the chaos. "Ironbears, meet them head-on! Vanguards, provide cover fire!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   With a roar, the Ironbears moved forward, their white bulky frames contrasting with the approaching Bloodtroopers. Flamethrowers roared to life, sending out streams of fire that lit up the battlefield. Behind them, Vanguard marines raised their Gauss Rifles, firing a barrage of bullets into the fight.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The two sides crashed together. Thermal Battleaxes met flamethrowers in brutal combat, each side fighting with fierce determination.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I'll have Pawan provide healing when needed," Xin said quietly, aware of Lorna beside him. "We'll get through this."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She nodded curtly, her eyes fixed on the enemy. The lavender scent lingered in Xin's nose, reminding him what he was fighting to protect.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As the Ironbears and Bloodtroopers fought, Xin glanced at the StarWhale shuttle and Space Rover attached to it, barely visible through the swirling dust.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Xin, watch out!" Lorna shouted, bringing him back to reality just in time to see a warhead flying toward a point miles behind them. Before he could react, it exploded in a blast of light and heat. Blood and body parts rained down as several Vanguards near the vault door were blown apart.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Buddha's balls!" he gasped, horrified. Time seemed to slow as each terrible detail burned into his mind. As the smoking remains of marines littered the ground and drifted in the low gravity, he saw kinetic arrows hitting the struggling Ironbears who fought to hold their position.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Ironbears, hold the line!" Thomas yelled through the comm. "Vanguards, split up and attack the Amber-Eyes!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna jumped into action, moving through the air with amazing agility, her Psytum Sword flashing as she cut down enemy after enemy. Xin was impressed by her ferocity despite the growing losses on their side.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Okay, stay focused," he whispered to himself, gritting his teeth. As arrows flew toward him, his Psi Shield Device activated, deflecting each deadly projectile and turning them to dust.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Die, Imperial scumbags!" Lorna shouted, her voice filled with determination and anger.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Pawan, follow Lorna!" Xin called out, drawing his 10mm Magnum to fire at the enemy archers. The smell of blood and burnt earth filled his nose.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Then, from the battle smoke, a figure appeared — tall and unhurried.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Xin's heart raced as the figure came closer. His long red coat with gold designs seemed clean despite the chaos around him. His sharp features came into focus, with eyes like steel. His black hair, swept back neatly, framed his pale face. Something about his cold confidence made Xin's stomach turn.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   And then he realized who it was. Joon-Seok Pak.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The name sent a shock through Xin, triggering many emotions. He'd never seen Joon-Seok in person, but most native Imperials knew the name. A man of wealth and power, his family had driven the unification of Korea and crushed many rebellions across the Imperium. Seeing him now was like reopening an old wound.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Who is that?" Lorna asked, her voice low and sharp as she changed her stance.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Prince Joon-Seok," Xin said bitterly. "A symbol of privilege."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Lorna's lips parted, her eyes narrowed. "He's skilled," she said quietly as her boots touched the ground. "I can tell from how he stands."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Joon-Seok stopped a few steps away, looking between Lorna and Xin, though he stared longer at Lorna. He gave a slight, almost mocking nod, then casually activated his Psytum Sword. The red energy blade came to life with a hiss, glowing like molten metal. He easily beheaded an Ironbear who tried to block his path with a graceful spin, the soldier's white helmet floating away with his body.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "So the famous Lorna Weiss has come to the bleak soil of Osram," Joon-Seok tilted his head in amusement as he kept looking at Lorna. "I've ordered my men not to attack you. Let's negotiate."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Don't think we have anything to talk about," Lorna replied. She gripped her Psytum Sword tighter, the energy blade vibrating as if sensing danger.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "We're both here for the Moondust Crystal. If you order your troops to stand down, I'll spare your life as you retreat," Joon-Seok continued, unfazed. "Though I'm surprised to see you wearing a Psi Shield Device. Swordsmen of our level shouldn't need such basic tools."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That's none of your business, scum," Xin interrupted, stepping forward beside Lorna.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "If I wanted to talk to you, worm, you would know," Joon-Seok replied arrogantly before narrowing his eyes. "Have we met before?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Wu Zhi-Xin. Does that name mean anything to you?" Xin spat out as he aimed his 10mm Magnum at the man. He didn't care if Joon-Seok could cut him down instantly. A message needed to be sent.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The engineer who brought the Crystal's data to the Alliance," Joon-Seok's sword remained lit as he grinned at Xin.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Lorna, let me handle him," Xin growled, stepping forward, his anger boiling over.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "No, Xin," Lorna's voice cut through his rising fury, sharp and firm. "This fight is mine."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Touching," In an instant, Joon-Seok's amused smile turned darker, and without warning, he lunged forward.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The fight between Lorna and Joon-Seok began in a blur of motion, their Psytum Swords clashing violently, sparks flying with each hit. At first, they seemed evenly matched, both moving with speed and precision, locked in a dance of blue and red psionic energies.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Blades streaked through the air, and the ground shook with each impact. Xin could barely tell who was attacking and who was defending. He saw Lorna pivot, blocking a vicious slash, her footwork seemingly perfect, her Psi Shield glowing faintly from the strain.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   But slowly, Joon-Seok began winning. His strikes became more fierce, his red blade cutting through the air with brutal grace. Lorna's movements became more defensive as Joon-Seok pressed forward more aggressively.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Go help the others, Xin!" Lorna shouted, her eyes never leaving Joon-Seok. "I'll handle him."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   In one smooth motion, Joon-Seok lunged, his Psytum Sword arcing through the air like a red lightning streak. Lorna met him head-on, her blade clashing with his in a burst of sparks, the force sending a shockwave through the ground.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Despite respecting Lorna, Xin couldn't follow this order. He knew what he had to do.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Go, Pawan!" Xin commanded firmly despite his fear. The small Omni-drone activated at his command, its green and black surface gleaming as it flew toward Joon-Seok, its spider-like limbs extending.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Honorless vermin!" Joon-Seok snarled, momentarily distracted by the drone's sudden attack. In that moment, Lorna quickly sidestepped his attack, her sword slicing through the air as Pawan hovered beside her, a stream of green light from the drone's dome surrounding her, boosting her strength.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Suddenly, another blast of red energy, brighter but less focused, shot through the air, missing Xin by inches and hitting the ground with a loud explosion. The impact sent dust and debris flying, separating Xin and Lorna.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Look out!" Xin shouted. He raised his arm as falling debris turned to dust against his Psi Shield, the explosion's wind whipping his jacket.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   From the settling dust emerged a figure, her black hair swaying after her attack. Dilinur Altai's silver Psi Fan shimmered, its detailed carvings catching the glow of her psionic energy.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You're still human, Lorna Weiss. I'm very disappointed," the Unblooded Prefect said. Her eyes glinted with amusement as she stepped forward with authority.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yeah, that's right! Because Alliance doctors are better at curing viruses than harvesting organs," Lorna taunted.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Very funny." Dilinur's voice was sharp. The fan in her hand spun, glowing with red psionic energy. "Step aside, Xin, or be squashed like the insect you are."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Die, Imperial!" Lorna rushed forward. Her Psytum Sword clashed with Joon-Seok's in a brilliant shower of sparks. The force of their collision echoed across the battlefield.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I'm sorry, Dinu. I wish there was another way," he whispered hoarsely as he stood firm. Aiming his 10mm Magnum at Dilinur's heart, he fired three quick shots.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   But before the AI-assisted calculations could finish, Dilinur had already raised her Psi Fan to protect her chest. The bullets shattered against the silver surface, turning to dust like glass against stone.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Did you think that engineer's toy could hurt me?" Dilinur sneered as she spun her fan again, pointing it directly at Xin.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Amid the chaos, Xin looked at Pawan, the drone's metal frame humming strangely as it hovered beside Lorna, its flickering dome showing low power. Their chances of survival were dropping by the second.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Just then, a warning buzzed in Xin's ear – his Psi Shield Device was failing. The device had been protecting him, but now, with Lorna using her Aether to maintain both their shields, it was reaching its limit.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He barely noticed the danger in time: two kinetic arrows flying toward him, one hitting his stomach while the other pierced his shoulder. The impact sent waves of blinding pain through his body, blood soaking into his beige jacket.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Fuck!" Lorna cried out desperately as Joon-Seok seized the chance to land a powerful blow, sending her to the ground even as she blocked it.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Lo...Lorna…" Xin stammered, fighting to stay conscious as his vision blurred at the edges. His limbs felt heavy from the numbing pain.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He tried to shout, to tell her he would fight to his last breath, but all that came out was a choked gasp as the world around him began to fade.
  </span>
