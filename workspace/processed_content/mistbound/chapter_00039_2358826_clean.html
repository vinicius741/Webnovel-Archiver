   “It can’t be done,” Terrance said flatly.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “What? But, you’re an expert at this!” Maeryn protested, her brows knitting together in confusion and disappointment.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   It was evening, and Maeryn had been waiting for Terrance’s return at the hotel for hours. Seeing her face, Terrance had correctly identified that she had a less-than-legal question for him and pulled her aside into a nearby alley so they wouldn’t be overheard.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   But the rogue’s outright rejection was completely unexpected.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “And that’s why I’m telling you it can’t be done. If we had more time, then sure, I could work at infiltrating the dark side of the sky here. But what you’re asking for… that takes connections I just don’t have here in Zephyr,” Terrance explained, his voice low but intense. “If the cell operated in Cloudreach, then that wouldn’t have been a problem - I was already in place and knew who to talk to and where to be to find that kind of thing out. On Airspire? I could maybe make some headway, since I’ve spent weeks there learning the ins and outs of the undercity. But in Zephyr? The sky-forsaken capital, where I’ve spent less than a day? Knowing that we’ll be here for only a few days, a week at most? I’d get nowhere.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn blinked, simultaneously frustrated at having her idea shot down so fiercely, and reluctantly accepting of the circumstances. She bit her lip, swallowing her disappointment. Before she could apologize, though, Terrance continued his rant.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I mean, how stupid would a terrorist cell have to be to be found, in only a few days, by someone unfamiliar with the territory? If they haven’t been caught yet, it’s because they’re smart enough to stay hidden and act covertly, keeping any trust to an absolute minimum. Maeryn, the Council of Winds absolutely
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    must
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   have been using their own spies and rogues ever since the airship academy incident! There’s no way under the sky that I’d get anywhere! Blight, it wouldn’t surprise me if there were people just waiting for word of someone just asking questions, and then I’d get snatched up!” Terrance took a deep breath, apparently winded from his rant.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   As Terrance opened his mouth to continue his tirade, Maeryn raised her hands up in the universal sign of surrender, eyes wide from the rogue’s words. She hadn’t considered how difficult and dangerous her request would be, and she felt incredibly foolish at the dressing down she’d just received. “I’m… I’m sorry, Terrance. I had no idea. I guess I just got used to you, I don’t know, somehow having all the answers on what goes on under the surface.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance’s stance softened, and he allowed himself to slouch as he digested Maeryn’s sincere apology. He took in her expression, the regret that shone in her eyes, and felt his anger crumble away. “That’s not fair. I can’t stay mad at you when you give me a compliment like that,” he grumbled, stubbornly fighting the upwards tug at his lips. “Listen. I can keep an ear out for any word of them, but don’t expect much, okay? Odds are we won’t hear a peep out of them while we’re here. We’re best off keeping to ourselves anyway. There’s no point in getting involved.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “But… what if the cell manages to do something bad enough that it sparks a war between our peoples?” Maeryn asked worriedly, wringing her hands together.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance grimaced. He understood the fear, intellectually at least. Maeryn still loved her people. She’d gone on this quest of stopping the Mist to save them. Terrance, though… he couldn’t claim to love his fellow Zephyrians. He’d had any such feelings burned out of him at a young age, when he was trained to rob from them. To steal from them. To spy on them. To kill them.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “This is going to sound cold,” he warned her, steeling himself to deliver a harsh but necessary lesson. “Maeryn. The Mist is more important. If a war happens… I won’t say it doesn’t matter, because it does. But if the Mist isn’t solved, then war and peace become
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    meaningless
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   . Everyone will die. You
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    have
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   to spend your time on that. Anything less, and we all become Mistwarped.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn flinched, physically recoiling from his words.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   A pang of guilt twisted in Terrance’s gut, but he pressed on. She had to understand this. He had to make her understand. “You won’t be able to give Ernesto and Dan what they need if you’re behind bars from a misunderstanding with the terrorist cell,” he continued ruthlessly. “You can’t fix everything, Maeryn, and it’s arrogant to believe you can. You’re just going to have to trust that cooler heads will prevail, and focus on what’s most important: solving the world-ending crisis. Okay? There’s literally no one else who knows about the Undead and the Mist, who also has a friendly necromancer in their employ able and willing to work on fixing the problem. You are
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    uniquely qualified
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   to fix the Mist problem.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I…” Maeryn looked down, visibly torn. Her mind raced, struggling to come up with something, anything to refute them, but… the logic was sound, and that fact was horrifying. “Your words make sense, but…!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “They’re hard to accept,” the rogue completed for her sympathetically, folding his arms. “I know. But you need to think about this kind of thing. Compassion’s great. The world runs on it, in the end. But sometimes, you gotta be a little ruthless, or the world suffers for it.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn fell silent, giving him a little nod. She hadn’t been fully convinced yet, Terrance could tell, but she was giving his words due consideration. That was the most he could ask for. He just wished he hadn’t needed to be the one to give her this particular reality check. He looked away, but otherwise kept still - it wouldn’t do to show weakness or uncertainty, or it would press his Captain to try to convince him otherwise.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   But blight and damnation, Terrance hoped this conversation wouldn’t change things between them.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Okay.” Maeryn’s voice was little more than a whisper, and Terrance tried not to flinch at the sound of it. She sounded… brittle. He’d never heard her like that before, and he hoped he never would again. “Okay,” she repeated, her voice steadier but still soft. “I’ll let this go. But you’ll tell me if you do hear anything, right?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Of course. Our decisions have to change when circumstances do,” Terrance agreed immediately, struggling to keep his voice even.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Then… I’ll focus on what I can do to help Dan and Ernesto. You’re right. The Mist has to take priority.” Maeryn turned on her heel and walked away, her back stiff, every step slow but deliberate.
  </span>

<span>
   Terrance had won. Why did he feel like he’d lost?
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Any such pondering was immediately flung from his brain when he heard a woman’s soft whisper in the dark alleyway behind him. “Now that… was an interesting conversation.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Fear flooded him instantly, and Terrance leapt forward, twisting around mid-leap to face the direction the voice had come from as he reached for his weapon. He hadn’t sensed the presence at all! How?!
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The figure stepped forward slightly, revealing… very little. The woman was dressed in a dark brown cloak with its hood up, and a plain half-mask covering her eyes and nose. “So it’s true, then. You survived, all those years ago.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance’s heart skipped a beat, and he swallowed, a bead of sweat forming on his forehead as he clenched his fist around the handle of his rapier. How did she know him? How did she know about his past?
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “It seems we have a great deal to talk about… Terrance Nightshade.”
  </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn sipped her tea bitterly as she sat in her room. Terrance hadn’t followed her back into the hotel, but she was honestly kind of glad for that. She needed some time alone after their hard conversation.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance’s advice had been… a bewildering mixture of cold and empathetic, compassionate but harsh. What he said made perfect sense when she stopped to think about it, but… she didn’t know anyone involved in the decision-making. How was she supposed to trust that the Zephyrian government wouldn’t retaliate against Geova if the terrorist cell did something truly horrific? She had seen firsthand how people like Sipund and Jim viewed her people—with disdain, if not outright hostility. How could she possibly trust in them to make the right decisions when they held so much power?
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   But Terrance was right. The Mist was, objectively speaking, more important, and if she got herself in trouble, that would inconvenience or maybe even incapacitate Dan and Ernesto. She shouldn’t take too large a risk. But… what about the people who would get caught up in the crossfire? If a war started, innocents would die, and it would all be for
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    nothing!
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   The Geovans and Zephyrians blamed each other for the mana and Mist crises, and if they went to war to take vengeance on each other then it would be so… so absolutely, horrifically
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    pointless
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   !
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   And Maeryn was supposed to just… accept that as a possibility? Just let it happen, because her time was better spent on stopping the Mist? Just write off the people that would die as… unfortunate, inevitable casualties? How was anyone supposed to do that and still be human?
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   How could she?
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
    “You can’t fix everything, Maeryn, and it’s arrogant to believe you can.”
   </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn bit her lip hard as Terrance’s harsh words replayed in her head. Was she being arrogant? Was it arrogance to try to stay involved in everything where she might make a positive difference? Especially when the stakes were so important?
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Her fingers tightened around the teacup, the porcelain still warm and smooth against her skin, though it was rapidly cooling. She didn’t think she was being arrogant, trying to save lives. And yet… it all came back to the best use of her time, didn’t it? The Mist would kill everyone if it wasn’t stopped. When it came right down to it, that was the cold, hard truth. The Geovans, the Zephyrians, everyone would die if the Mist wasn’t fixed.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   If Maeryn focused her actions on stopping the war, but it ended up costing everyone in the end because she wasn’t able to give Ernesto and Dan enough support to finish making “holy” mana… then she couldn’t say that she’d saved anybody. Rationally speaking, that was the right answer. It had to be.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   But if war broke out… Maeryn wasn’t sure she’d ever forgive herself for not trying to stop it.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Of course, there was nothing she could do about it now, anyway. She didn’t even know where the terrorist cell was, or how to reach them anyway. And even if she somehow found them, how was she supposed to make them listen to her?
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn set down her now-empty teacup bitterly as she contemplated her own powerlessness to effect any change at all. “Depths and damnation,” she swore quietly. “I hate this.” She looked out the window to look out at Zephyr, her eyes not focusing anywhere in particular as her vision flicked across the massive city. “Please. Please don’t make me regret this.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   A sudden knock on the door startled her, and Maeryn nearly jumped out of her chair at the sound of it. “Urgent missive for Captain Maeryn of the airship Stonewing! Are you present, Captain Maeryn?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn blinked. The hotel did message delivery right to her door? Since when? Shaking off her bewilderment, she rose to her feet. “Be right there!” She quickly strode over and opened the door, seeing a boy that she didn’t recognize. Maybe a year or two younger than her, based on his face and stature, but the boy was wearing the hotel’s uniform. “I’m Captain Maeryn. What’s the missive?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Right here, Captain!” The boy raised both his hands, holding an unlabeled envelope. As soon as Maeryn took it from him, the boy nodded briskly and stepped backwards. “Missive delivered! Thank you for choosing Varia Hotel &amp; Suites!” And then he turned on his heel and left, rapidly retreating and leaving Maeryn standing there dumbly.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   After a moment, she shook her head. “So… that happened…” She stepped back into her room and closed the door before opening the envelope and scanning the enclosed letter.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
    Captain Maeryn d’Vert…
   </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn stopped reading, her mind going completely blank for a long moment. They knew her name. They knew her
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    full
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   name… meaning they knew she was Geovan. Who?! Who wrote this letter?!
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Heart pounding like a drum, she skipped to the end, and was momentarily infuriated to find it unsigned. “Blight!” she swore fervently, borrowing Terrance’s strongest curse. It felt appropriate.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   With little choice, she grit her teeth and started over.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
    Captain Maeryn d’Vert,
   </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
    Welcome to Zephyr. Your presence is most unexpected, but you will find that it is not unwanted. Your conversation in the alley near the hotel you reside at was most illuminating, and yet we find ourselves more and more curious. It would seem that we have much to catch up on, and perhaps there are certain ways we can be of aid to each other.
   </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
    You are cordially invited to meet with us tonight. Meet us at the Council of Winds headquarters at 1:30 AM.
   </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
    Have no fear for your companion’s safety. Terrance is unharmed, and will remain so regardless of whether you attend tonight’s meeting.
   </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
    However, let us not play any games with one another: we all know that we will see you tonight.
   </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The missive ended there abruptly, and Maeryn crumpled the letter in her fist angrily. Humiliation and shame and rage warred within her, but Maeryn knew one thing for certain: the writer was correct. She would be there.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Her hands shook slightly as she set the crumpled paper on the desk, her mind racing with questions and a deep, gnawing fear. They had Terrance. That much was clear. And they knew far more about her than she had ever intended to reveal. She felt cornered, exposed, and the very idea made her stomach churn.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn closed her eyes, taking a deep breath to steady herself. This was a trap, no doubt about it. But they had Terrance… and they knew too much already. If she didn’t go, who knew what they would do next?
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   She opened her eyes, her gaze hardening with determination. “Fine,” she muttered under her breath, immediately stripping off her captain’s jacket and beginning her familiar process of maintaining her vambraces. “They may think this is just a game… but we’ll see who’s really the hunter. And who, in the end, is the
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    prey
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   .”
