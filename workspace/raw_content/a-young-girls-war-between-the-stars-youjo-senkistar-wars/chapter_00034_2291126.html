<p class="cnM1OTRjNDE2ZDkwNDRjYTJiZjZiN2E2ODU5NDdjYWFm" style="margin-bottom: 0">I looked up from my study of the green Tund holocron as my ship’s holocom rang. Standing, I put it out of sight of the video pickup and accepted the call. Taria appeared on the other side, standing in what appeared to be the little secure storage unit used as a drop point where I’d left the holocrons I’d gotten from Tython.</p>
<p class="cnMzNTQxN2JmYTQ4ZjRjZmJiY2QxNmFiZjhlZTBiZjcw" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnNhOTk4YjhkZGE5MzRjODliMWY0NmMxZjBlNGUyZWQz" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Good job on finding these,” she said, tossing one in the air and catching it—what I believed to be the one from Mahara Kesh. “Given Tython’s history, I’m sure they’re just scratching the surface of the artifacts and holocrons just laying around waiting for someone to pick them up.”</p>
<p class="cnNmZTRiNjg5ZDc4ZTQwMGJiMTZlOTZmOTI3MzFhMzBm" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnMxNTA5MzY5NWY4ZDRiY2FiMmM1NGU0NDkzODE2OGNj" style="margin-bottom: 0">I nodded. “As I said in the report I left, I felt the pull of several other objects or locations in the Force. I wouldn’t send down settlers without sending in a team first to clear them.”</p>

<p class="cnM2YjZiMGY5MDczYzQzNjY4NzI0NDVmMzJlODU0ZTdk" style="margin-bottom: 0">The aqua haired girl shook her head. “I think the High Council is going to pass on Tython. They’re considering Jedha. It’s a little cold desert moon with breathable atmosphere and a small local population of only about ten or eleven million. It’s directly galactic west of Coruscant, close enough to reach within a few days by way of Ord Mantell and Burke’s Trailing, and is of significant historical importance. It helps that there are huge, easily accessed Kyber crystal deposits and existing artifacts that couldn’t be moved when the Jedi last left it. Also…”</p>

<p class="cnM3Mzc1ZTYzZDkxNTRhNjA4Yzc5OGIwNWY4NTZhMjBi" style="margin-bottom: 0">She paused, her voice going quiet, “You gave a report on the nexus under the Coruscant Temple screwing with your senses. We’ve confirmed it. We’ve also confirmed that there is lasting damage to everyone who has been there long enough—which means basically all of the Masters. The thought among the Masters of the various Councils is that the Kyber Mirrors on Jedha can burn away the dark side energy clouding our senses, but it may take time. The light side Force nexus under the Kyber Temple there should be enough for the younger students, with time.”</p>

<p class="cnM1MzU3MjMxMGRlMTRiZTZhYjRhZWYwMThkYzM3Mjk1" style="margin-bottom: 0">“I see,” I murmured. “After my last visit, spending time on top of one of the nexuses on Tython fixed the issue for me. It didn’t take long.”</p>

<p class="cnNlOTA2YmU2YWVkZjQxYzFhYjQ2ZDQ3YjA3NjFmMmFh" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Yes, but you notoriously didn’t spend much time in the Temple,” Taria pointed out, to which I nodded. “About that favor you asked for.”</p>

<p class="cnM5Zjk3ZjM1MTMwOTQzNzdiYWMzYjk2NmUyMmMxM2Vi" style="margin-bottom: 0">“No one has been in contact with Master Qui-Gon or Obi-Wan recently. I think you were the last to speak with them, actually. They had taken an assignment on Duneeden but haven’t made contact since they reached the planet. When you’re done with Simpla-12, if we haven’t heard from them since, I’ll need you to go check up on them. It’s not like Master Qui-Gon to go this long incommunicado unless he’s on a mission that requires a communication blackout.”</p>

<p class="cnMyODQ0ZjIxYTI1YTRlN2ViZWY4NDRlMjBhZTM4ZGY4" style="margin-bottom: 0">Taria eyed me for a moment before answering, “Remember I said some things fell by the wayside a few years back?” When I nodded, she continued, “A former senator’s son disappeared around that time. Uta S’orn’s son Ren. Master Mundi dismissed it as a runaway. Ren was Force-sensitive, but his mother refused to allow him into the Order. Mundi was the one who went to recruit the boy originally some years ago, but for whatever reason, he decided to leave the child with his mother.”</p>

<p class="cnMzMGE1YzJhN2YyNTRiMjM5NWUxYmUzZTQ2NGI5ZDYw" style="margin-bottom: 0">Taria shook her head. “No, I need you on-mission for Simpla.” Considering for a moment, she said, “<em>Fine</em>. You’ve got that look on your face like you’re trying to decide how to creatively misinterpret orders to justify turning around. I’ll send Master Adi Gallia and her Padawan, Siri Tachi. I believe you’re acquainted.” When I nodded, Taria continued, “I’ll shoot you an update once they report in.”</p>

<p class="cnM5ZmU2MTI2OTUxYTQzYjY4ODhlOTdhMjljMzg4ZWI4" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">I stared at her for a moment, trying to decide if this was some sort of trick to get me to admit guilt. Finally, I said, “I will neither confirm nor deny the existence of any such copies—”</p>

<p class="cnM5ZTY1NDM2MmQ1YjRhZTA5OWVkYTVmNzVkZDJjMGRh" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Maybe,” I murmured, and she shook her head.</p>

<p class="cnM3OTJkM2I5YTg5YjQ1Y2VhOTIyZjRlYjViZGMxNDZm" style="margin-bottom: 0">We said our goodbyes and the call disconnected. Pulling the Tund holocron back to me, I refocused on delving into its secrets. Unlike the holocrons on Tython, this one was <em>not</em><span style="font-style: normal"> meant for ease of access and </span><em>sharing</em><span style="font-style: normal"> knowledge. It appeared to be a test. First, a test to see if the one wielding it was too dark in the Force.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMWFiZTllODkwYzQ2NjliNjM3N2ZkZjc2MDMwMzQ2" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM0MDJiNDFkMGRjOTQyZWJhN2NjM2YxMTRiZWNiZmJl" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal">It had apparently accepted me because I’d moved on to the second test—a sort of puzzle </span><span style="font-style: normal">that involved patching the holes in a very intricate weave of the Force that I had never seen before, </span><span style="font-style: normal">outside of one place, that being my computation orb</span><span style="font-style: normal">. It was very complicated, but as I worked on it, I was beginning to see the bigger picture—that whatever this was was meant to do things you couldn’t normally do with raw Force manipulation. It appeared to be the building blocks of a Force technique that required much more complexity than something like Telekinesis, Tutaminis, or other techniques—in fact, it reminded me more of my own formulas than pure Force manipulation, given just how </span><em>precise</em><span style="font-style: normal"> and </span><em>complex</em><span style="font-style: normal"> it was.</span></p>

<p class="cnM4ZjY1NzMzNGFkYzQyNDlhZWVjZGQ5N2ViNjdlNzJm" style="margin-bottom: 0">I was beginning to suspect that the puzzle itself was a lesson, teaching the person attempting it how to do something in the Force required to learn the contents of the holocron. Which would make sense, really. You could <em>tell</em><span style="font-style: normal"> someone how to paint and they wouldn’t necessarily </span><em>get it</em><span style="font-style: normal"> until they picked up a brush and started applying paint to canvas. </span><span style="font-style: normal">Sometimes, the best way to learn was to do, and the best way to teach was to do so by example.</span></p>

Checking the external cameras, I saw who I was expecting and quickly triggered the hatch release. The door actioned open and I waved the Mando standing outside carrying a crate in. He hurried inside and dropped the metal crate on the deck.</p>

<p class="cnNjM2Y2ZWFlYTJiYTQyMTc5MmViNjczZGJjZTRhNDAz" style="margin-bottom: 0">Reaching in, I ran my hand over the smooth, matte black chest piece. It was cool to the touch and experimentally lifting it showed it was very light. There was a note taped to it, written in Mandalorian—a simple explanation that since it was only Beskar plated, it had been made with my current Beskar light armor chest piece in mind and would just fit over the top of it directly as an extra layer of armor.</p>

<p class="cnNhNjc3M2M4MDQwODQ0M2Y5ZjFmZDg4YmZkOTk1YzJl" style="margin-bottom: 0">As for the rest, it was pretty standard fare. Boot covers to go over the tops of my boots. Shin guards. Pieces to cover the knees and thighs. Pauldrons for the shoulders with the same Mythosaur/Tirra’Taka skull insignia as my normal ones. Plates to go over the back of my wrists. Vambraces with the tools I wanted on them. And finally, a helmet.</p>

<p class="cnM4ZGFiYzNmYWYwMjQ2YjFhMDFlNjU5MDBiMThkZWFi" style="margin-bottom: 0">Stripping out of my robes, I made my way back to the locker with my clothes and folded them up, before taking out a new set of clothes. Before I’d stopped by Coruscant, I had put in a call to a place I’d done some research on who produced custom clothes. I’d shot off my measurements and the required credits when they quoted me a price and collected my order when I arrived.</p>

<p class="cnNjMWZmYWUxM2UyNDQ0NTZhNDk2OWM2MTVmMDEyODJi" style="margin-bottom: 0">What I’d had commissioned was a multi-piece vac suit made for combat and extended use in the field, and for getting into and out of as quickly and easily as normal clothes. It separated down into six different pieces—two boots, two gloves, bottom, and top—which all came together seamlessly. Once everything was on and the suit sealed, I’d have to either cut it or use the under-wrist mounted hidden control panel to disengage individual parts or the whole thing at once.</p>

<p class="cnNmYjk4MmFiNWU1NTQzYzhiMjg5NDhlZDMyMDg0NDU5" style="margin-bottom: 0">The interior was lined with something that felt silky smooth on my skin as I pulled it on, but which would wick away sweat like my body stockings. It could be fully environmentally sealed and was climate controlled, so long as the power cell maintained a charge. It had its own air reserve and recycler built into a small panel on the back of the suit, which would go under my armor, and could connect to any standard helmet connection. Like the armor, it was flat black and clung to my body like a second skin, and stretched with my movements in a way that wouldn’t impede my ability to fight.</p>

It looked very much like a very big Wild West style six shooter, with a few modern touches to make it more modifiable than the WESTAR-35. It was a double barreled heavy blaster pistol, meant to be </span><em>very</em><span style="font-style: normal"> punchy and very fast at close to mid range, with no thought to ammunition conservation—it was supposed to punch through most armor or cover and put whatever you pointed it at down on the first shot, not the tenth.</span></p>

<p class="cnMxMDkwOTIyOGEzMTQwMDBiNmI5ZjRmNTFkYzcxOTAw" style="margin-bottom: 0">The man was sprawled across his desk and snoring before I made it out the door to his office. I opened a comm link to Arthree as I left the building. “Arthree, when we took the scans of the city, which of those buildings looked like it would have been an old hospital?”</p>

<p class="cnNmZjE0NzE2OTcwYTQxY2Q4NThkNDkzMjZiMzFlNjhl" style="margin-bottom: 0">For an abandoned building, it was remarkably clean. Recently renovated, even—within the last few years. I supposed I shouldn’t be terribly surprised, considering it was being used as an illicit scientific research lab until just recently—it would make sense that it would be a bit decrepit on the outside but up to a certain standard on the inside.</p>

<p class="cnM3YjU4NGNhYWM0MDQ2ZTRhNDk3N2E0ZjQ1YWFlMDdm" style="margin-bottom: 0">Following my senses deeper into the building, I eventually found a large room that reeked of misery soaked into the walls—and Force. As though more than one Jedi or Force sensitive had suffered and died here. Unfortunately, what I did not find was any sort of evidence, no clue as to where Ms. Arbor had fled to, no electronics left over to see if she had been sloppy about hiding her plans or even to tell me what sort of research she was doing here beyond studying the Force in living beings.</p>

<p class="cnM4ZjI4YWY4ZjQ3MDQ4MThiNTk2N2ZhMGQ5MTNjNWY4" style="margin-bottom: 0">Annoyed, I left the building and slipped back through the city, towards the tavern the local constabulary had indicated as it began to pour down rain, lightning popping overhead. Stepping indoors out of the rain, I pulled my hood back, making my way into the tavern and looking around. I took in the tavern and its patrons.</p>

<p class="cnM2NTNlNDkwNDBjODQ5YjJiNjZjZTg2NDFmOTc3ZDVh" style="margin-bottom: 0">The place was busy, but not full. Most of the clientele looked to be on the shady side—even more so than your usual cantina patrons. Everyone had a kind of dusty, grungy look to them, probably caused by the dust in the atmosphere from the mines I’d read about when researching the planet on the flight over. Stuff that got kicked up every time the wind blew and seemed to coat everything around here.</p>

<p class="cnNiM2NkNjliZmU0ODRlMTJhYmNmNjExNzhiMDQwZWRl" style="margin-bottom: 0">True to the constable’s words, I spotted an older yellow male twi’lek in the back corner, doing business over drinks. He looked up as I entered and briefly nodded my way before turning back to his conversation. Not too far away from him was a bald human-looking woman wearing armor, sipping at something that looked like beer.</p>

<p class="cnNiMTkzMjUxN2VlODQwOTc4YjQyYThkYWE3M2UwMWJm" style="margin-bottom: 0">Making my way over to a table with a view of the twi’lek’s booth, and coincidentally the woman who had the information I needed, I settled in and waited. A few moments later, a modified protocol droid walked over, its feet clanking against the wooden floor. “How can I serve you, madame?”</p>
<p class="cnM1MmM3YWE0OTQ1YTQxODRiMzcyMjg0OTkzYjFlZDQy" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM4Yzc4ZWEwZDRlMDQ4NzE5Y2EwMTY3NGY0MzEyNDFh" style="margin-bottom: 0">“What do you have to eat?” I asked, before correcting myself, “Something a human would find palatable.”</p>
<p class="cnNkY2UwOTkxYmUwYjQwZmNhODE1NjlhNThlMzc5OTA1" style="margin-bottom: 0"><br/>The droid rattled off a very short list of selections that sounded mostly like exactly the kind of bar food I’d expect to find—meat and cheese on a bun with sauce, or meat, cheese, and vegetables either with a grain, noodles, or wrapped in something like a tortilla. In other words: Space American, Space Mexican, or Space Asian. In between my experiences on Coruscant, Mandalore, and Serenno and talking with the Mandalorians, I’d come to a few conclusions on those options.</p>
<p class="cnNkYTQzNmZhZmMyNDRkYTI4NTU0ZjNjYTc4MmMzN2Fl" style="margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM5MTdkNjRkMzQyNTQwOTU4ZmY5OGU4MWY0NGVmNmU1" style="margin-bottom: 0">Space Asian tended to be hit or miss. Either it was <em>fantastic</em><span style="font-style: normal"> or it was awful, and whether it was one or the other tended to directly correlate to how close one was either to the Core, or to largely aquatic worlds with aquatic-type sentient races. Mon </span><span style="font-style: normal">Calamari, for instance, knew their seafood and their tastes where seafood was concerned largely overlapped with those of humans and near-humans. </span><span style="font-style: normal">Simpla-12 was </span><em>not</em><span style="font-style: normal"> an aquatic world, near to one, nor did it get enough imports to guarantee good seafood</span><span style="font-style: normal">.</span><span style="font-style: normal"> Which meant it was likely to be slop. I gave it a hard pass.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZTFjMTBjNDY4MzRlYzc5MmNiZTZiMTE4MWMyNThl" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0"> </p>
<p class="cnM5N2YzMmE5NGM0YjRhZGJiNzZjMTFhMDQ2ZjdhYzU2" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal">Space Mexican tended to be pretty consistent throughout the galaxy, as long as the planet it was on had some decent local agriculture infrastructure or got imports. It was easy to get right and hard to mess up so </span><span style="font-style: normal">badly</span><span style="font-style: normal"> that what you were left with was inedible. The biggest risk was in whatever they were using for cheese and meat, and outside of agri-worlds, </span><span style="font-style: normal">well-developed worlds,</span><span style="font-style: normal"> or the Core, you either </span><em>didn’t ask</em><span style="font-style: normal"> or you avoided it. </span><span style="font-style: normal">Given that this place was a mudball and that lack of good imports, </span><span style="font-style: normal">I was iffy on it.</span></p>

<p class="cnNiMGIzZjdhYWI1YTRiZjE4ZWViYWFiN2U2NTBmNDVl" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal">Space American was the simplest, and conversely actually easier to fuck up than Space Mexican. Salt, grease, butter, meat, bread, and maybe some vegetables. You’d think that would be easy to get right, but you’d be wrong. But in backwater places like this, it was the surest bet—and a look at the tables around me showed </span><em>most</em><span style="font-style: normal"> of the people eating were partaking of something like a hamburger</span><span style="font-style: normal"> made from nerf meat, which was one of the things shipped practically everywhere, including pit stops like Simpla-12.</span></p>

Simple. Droids, such as the one working the kitchen, weren’t known for their creativity or ability to improvise when it came to food they couldn’t taste, smell, or digest. Most of them would look at a brick of pre-formed meat patties and not be able to make the intuitive leap that they could break that down into ingredients for something else. </span><span style="font-style: normal">But they could cook a burger with a minimum standard of accuracy and edibility every time, </span><span style="font-style: normal">with the proper ingredients already laid out for them.</span></p>
