Missiles and torpedoes certainly, but someone creative could also outfit them with a battery of turbolasers per container.

Until eventually, I flipped myself over feet first and touched down with a solid click of mag boots engaging against the hull.

<p class="cnNjN2U1MWUxYjk0NjQ0YzJiYzI2NzA5YjY0ZTBjZGI3" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">I crouched over the circular hatch and studied the simple keypad mechanism beside it—twelve buttons arranged in four rows of three, 0 through 9, backspace, and enter. The keypad was recessed and secured with bolts, with a simple anti-tamper alarm circuit that would go off it someone broke the circuit by opening the panel. It was about as secure as a civilian vessel could make it, without booby trapping the hatch—and a check with the Force showed it was safe.</p>

A mage blade caught his head and tore through, in one side and out the other. He dropped like a rock but, to my annoyance, he wasn’t dead—just incapacitated, as his wound began to quickly heal over. Grabbing him with the Force, I pulled him inside and closed the door. Looking around, I found a screwdriver and jerked it over. Rolling him over, I located the point where his neck and head met and slammed it in down to the handle. The alien, Abyssin?, jerked once but otherwise remained still as I dragged him over to a chair and propped him in it after making sure the rest of the room was empty.

Only a few ships had managed to weather the attack, but even they hadn’t come out unscathed—and going by the radio traffic, they weren’t going to be able to do anything about the ones currently falling towards the planet in time to save them.</span></p>

Ten seconds after that, I eased back on the throttle and let the bigger ship pull away, eventually exiting its wake with a bit of shaking but little beyond that.</span></p>

<p class="cnNkNGNjZTEwMTNhZjQ1YjdiNjg4YjJlNTZmMjQ4ZTk2" style="margin-bottom: 0">Jaster was woken from a sound sleep by some sort of siren going off. Rolling out of bed, he pulled his pants on and grabbed a blaster. Poking his head out into the hall, he found a few people in the hotel doing likewise in various states of undress. From somewhere, he heard someone say, “I think that’s an air raid siren.”</p>

Stepping out onto the balcony overlooking the city, he was amused to find the Jedi occupying the balconies on either side of him. Master Dooku and Qui-Gon were looking into the air so Jaster followed their gazes, spotting a fiery red streak coming down towards the city <em>fast</em><span style="font-style: normal">. Squinting, he thought he could make out the form of a ship through the blaze around the deflector shields.</span></p>

<p class="cnNmYWFmYWM2NzU2ZTRlNTZiODY0ZWQ3NTIyNTEyOTZj" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">“I believe it’s the big cargo ship we saw parked in orbit,” Master Qui-Gon answered, not sounding quite sure himself.</p>

Jaster turned and held his hand out to Qui-Gon, who sighed and nodded. “In the morning, if you don’t mind.”</p>
