   </span>
   ilinur sat across from Prince Joon-Seok Pak, pretending to focus on her rice while stealing glances at him. He was handsome, with snow white countenance, dark wavy hair contrasting against his red and gold embroidered coat. His sharp jawline and intense brown eyes caught her attention most.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The duck is cooked well. Just the right amount of spice," the Prince commented as he reached for another piece.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Indeed, milord," Dilinur fumbled with her chopsticks, struggling to pick up the sticky rice. "Indeed..." she repeated.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Imperial fusion restaurant was decorated in deep crimson and gold, its opulence only highlighting her awkwardness.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Their table was loaded with abalone in oyster sauce, Peking duck, and lotus root in sweet soy. Dilinur kept eyeing the Dongpo Pork swimming in dark gravy. Food like this was central to Imperial negotiations—showing wealth through meals as much as words.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You seem to be struggling with those, Prefect Altai," Kaori observed with subtle amusement as she delicately cut a slice of duck. "One might wonder how you rose to such prominence without mastering even the basic tools of Imperial etiquette."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Despite the heat rising to her cheeks, Dilinur kept her face neutral. "Where I grew up, we had other priorities."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You ask me, world's got bigger problems than which finger goes where on a stick," Iron Roach said through a mouthful of abalone, not looking up. His red sunglasses gleamed in the restaurant's light.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaori's expression tightened at Roach's bluntness as she ate her duck.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Prince Joon-Seok took a sip of wine before setting his glass down. "Allow me," he said, reaching across the table.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur froze as his hand closed over hers. His fingers were warm and gentle as he adjusted her grip.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She noticed a deactivated Psytum Sword resting next to Joon-Seok's dish.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Joon-Seok's sword, she thought.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The lower one remains stationary," he explained gently. "It rests here, against your ring finger, providing stability." His thumb brushed her knuckle briefly. "The upper stick moves, controlled by these two fingers."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur focused more on his hand than the lesson. The slight callouses on his fingertips from sword training felt pleasant against her skin.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Now, try," he said, pulling his hand away.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur steadied herself and tried the motion. The chopsticks closed properly, capturing some rice. A small victory.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Very good," Joon-Seok nodded with a hint of a smile. "Adaptability serves you well. A quality most valued in the Imperium." He returned to his meal, picking up a piece of lotus root.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaori watched with narrowed eyes, her posture stiffening. "How...instructive of you, Your Highness."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Iron Roach snorted, reaching for more abalone. "Should we talk about why we're here? The Crystal isn't going to extract itself." His mechanical fingers drummed impatiently on the tablecloth.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur looked at the hologram floating above the table. Osram rotated slowly, showing detailed surface features. Thin lines etched across the image, mapping routes over craters and valleys, all converging toward a point deep within the moon's core.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The image centered on a crystalline structure: the Moondust Crystal, shimmering with prismatic light.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "This Crystal must be housed in one of the ancient Neptunian Vaults," Joon-Seok said as the hologram's light reflected in his eyes. "Besides the Radi-Mons, they are the only culture which can construct networks deep into a moon."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Never seen a Neptunian myself," Roach said, grabbing his wine glass with metal fingers. "What do they look like? Ugly blue octopi? Scantily dressed, sexy ladies?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Roach." Dilinur frowned.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Just kidding, Dinu," Roach said before gulping his wine.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "No human has," Joon-Seok replied patiently before finishing his lotus root. "The civilization is thought to have gone extinct millions of years ago. Earlier this century, the Imperial Legion discovered numerous ruins on Neptune's moons. Scientists named this civilization accordingly."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That explains why no one lives there," Kaori pouted between bites of pork. "I would never want to live close to dead alien ruins."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "We'd likely be venturing into an ancient dungeon, then," Dilinur said, pointing at the hologram. "These tunnels appear to form a defensive network."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Quite so," Joon-Seok nodded. "And that presents both challenge and opportunity."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur leaned forward, forgetting her earlier embarrassment. "The Terra Alliance will have analysts studying the same pathways. If they've identified the Crystal's location as well, we'll likely encounter resistance."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Let them come," Kaori said coldly, taking a bite of abalone. "More glory for us when we tear them to pieces."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Roach set down his empty glass with a thud. "Alliance, Directorate, Sand Lotus...doesn't
  </span>
  <span>
   matter. We'll crush whoever stands in our way." He poured himself more wine.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Speaking of the Directorate," Joon-Seok remarked, swirling his wine, "our intelligence suggests they've become increasingly active on the moon. Their Kimaris Warband has been reported on the Far Side."
  </span>
 </p>
 <span>
  <br/>
  You could be reading stolen content. Head to the original site for the genuine story.
  <br/>
 </span>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaori's expression darkened. "The Maridians have become quite a nuisance. But their technology is primitive compared to ours."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yet effective in its own way," Dilinur pointed out as she successfully picked up some abalone. "Their Scarab mechs have proven formidable in several recent engagements."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Aren't those just bad copies of Digital Era cartoons?" Kaori dismissed with a shrug. "My Draconic Engine could blast them to dust in one shot." She sipped her wine and dabbed her lips.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Their leader, Kofi Mensah, is no fool, either," Joon-Seok countered with a tone of respect. "His administration has secured significant influence on Jovian moons where both Alliance and Imperium have failed to impress the locals."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Roach laughed harshly. "Bah, look at us, talking about jobs on a fucking Saturday night!" He speared more pork with a chopstick, ignoring Kaori's grimace.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Roach, watch your manners!" Dilinur glanced at Joon-Seok. "At least show enough courtesy to let our visitor finish his thought."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yet Sir Roach has a point. Very well." Joon-Seok grinned as he picked up a piece of duck. "Do you each have some form of indulgence? Any recreational pursuit you find pleasurable?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I go to Osram and browse the antiques at Yue Shanghai," Kaori answered, adjusting her hairpin. "There's a jade toad figurine I've been eager to add to my collection. Proposed 2 million Imperium Yuan to purchase it, but the seller insisted it wasn't for sale."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur suppressed a groan, envious of Kaori's wealth. "What a...covetable dilemma to face."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Indeed," Joon-Seok said, giving Dilinur an approving look. "I prefer the fitness center, personally. There's something peculiarly relaxing about tearing down old muscle tissue and having fresh ones develop."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I can imagine so," Dilinur felt herself blushing as she glanced at Joon-Seok's physique.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "So you what, hit on the girls at the gym? One night stands?" Roach leaned forward, wine on his breath. "That still trendy these days?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaori covered her forehead with her hand and scoffed.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "One of these days we need to have Cheng teach you proper speech, Roach." Dilinur shook her head.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Too late," Roach grinned. "Fuck! That reminds me. Cheng still owes me seven thousand Yuans."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "For?" Dinu's eyes narrowed.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "For a bet!" Roach pointed at her. "You still haven't found a boyfriend, Dinu. Cheng said you'd agree to a date with him BY JANUARY!" He laughed loudly. "Thanks for making me rich."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "…you're quite welcome," Dilinur replied dryly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Your Royal Highness, when we reach the Moondust Crystal, how would we extract it?" Kaori asked, changing the subject.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I have a few Peons at my disposal if you need them," Roach added, scooping up some lotus root with his spoon. "Best indentured servants on this side of Earth."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Five Peons should suffice," Joon-Seok agreed, taking a sip of wine. "But the Terra Alliance and their Psi Lynx agents will undoubtedly be at the vault door. We may need an extra set of hands to secure our dominance."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What extra hands might you be referring to?" Dilinur asked.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You call him Flesh Pot," Joon-Seok's voice remained smooth. "Governor Qin's reports indicate he's ready for deployment but requires Helionite consumption to be fully awakened. I've procured a cart full of Helionite. With his strength, we can overcome any opposition and secure the Moondust Crystal."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur studied Joon-Seok's face for signs of doubt. There were none. She nodded, feeling the weight of the mission.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "If you prefer, Prince Joon-Seok," she said evenly, "I may show you to his Tissue Culture Container after this meal."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That would be best," he nodded.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Just then, Dilinur's stomach growled loudly. Her cheeks flushed as everyone stared at her. She looked away, hiding in the shadows of her robe.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You have not eaten any of the main dishes," Joon-Seok observed neutrally. "Is the food not to your liking?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Before she could answer, Kaori smiled coldly. "Perhaps our selection is too...sophisticated for certain palates."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Surprisingly, Roach broke the tension by waving down a waiter.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Get us some decent food here!" he barked. "Lamb skewers, and uh, Kash-something. Kashgar stuffed flatbreads! Turpan grape leaf dolmas."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The waiter looked confused.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Got Helionite in your ears?" Roach frowned.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I am most sincerely sorry, sir. Would you mind…" the waiter bowed.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Uyghur section," Roach clarified firmly. "Forgot which page it was on your fancy menu. Triple portions, all of them!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur stared at him, surprised.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What?" Roach shrugged. "Spent three years stationed on the Western Border. Best damn food I've ever had. Criminal those Unblooded dishes aren't on more menus."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "How...quaint," Kaori murmured, setting down her chopsticks. "I heard those foods are eaten with bare hands."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Best way to enjoy real food," Roach insisted. "Taste gets in your skin that way. Stays with you."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The dishes arrived quickly, their rich aromas mixing with the refined Imperial cuisine. Dilinur felt a wave of homesickness. The skewers were perfectly charred, the flatbreads stuffed with spiced meats and vegetables, and the dolmas carefully wrapped.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Show us," Joon-Seok said, focusing on Dilinur. "The proper way to enjoy these."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur demonstrated how to eat the lamb from the skewer using teeth and fingers. The familiar motion reminded her of her childhood.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Like this," she said, passing a skewer to Joon-Seok.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   To her surprise, he followed her example gracefully. When he bit into the lamb, he closed his eyes momentarily in appreciation.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Remarkable," he said, opening his eyes to meet hers. "The flavors are bold, unapologetic. Our Imperium has much to learn."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Pardon?" she asked, her heart skipping as she admired his features.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "About embracing diverse culinary traditions," he replied between bites.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Roach was already on his second skewer. Kaori held her skewer at arm's length, examining it like a specimen before taking a cautious bite. Her eyes widened slightly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The spice blend is quite…distinctive," she finally said.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It's called 'ziran,'" Dilinur explained, feeling validated. "A mixture of cumin, red pepper, salt, and other spices passed down through generations."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The heat builds gradually," Joon-Seok observed, reaching for a flatbread. "Complex rather than overwhelming. A thoughtful balance."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   They ate in comfortable silence for several minutes, the earlier tension fading. Dilinur watched Joon-Seok's expressions as he tried each dish, noting his genuine appreciation.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As they finished, Joon-Seok turned to Kaori and Roach. "Lady Ouyang, Sir Roach. It has been a pleasure dining with you both. I believe Prefect Altai and I have some logistical matters to discuss."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Getting tired of us already?" Roach raised an eyebrow, but looked relieved.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What are our orders, Prince Pak?" Kaori maintained her composure despite the obvious dismissal.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Await my instructions tomorrow. I need to discuss some operational details with Prefect Altai," Joon-Seok replied politely but firmly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaori stood and bowed deeply before leaving precisely. Roach simply got up and left without ceremony.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As their footsteps faded, Joon-Seok turned his full attention to Dilinur, his eyes reflecting the subdued lighting.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "After dinner, perhaps a stroll?" he suggested, his tone hinting at something beyond professional courtesy. "Then we may inspect this Flesh Pot you've been cultivating."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   For once amid the shadows of Imperial politics, Dilinur found herself intrigued by what might lie behind those composed features. "That would be most welcome, Your Highness."
  </span>
 </p>
