   Chapter 31
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  I was up before dawn again the next morning - and again thankful for Ken and Sparkle helping me sleep peacefully - to meet Oberon. There was a distinct chill in the air that morning, with lower temperatures than normal and a thick fog blanketing the world, so I didn't get quite so dressed up for this visit. Instead, I layered a green skirt over black leggings with a green blouse, darker colors than I usually wore but I felt somber colors would look more serious. I finished the outfit with a pair of comfortable ankle boots, and was surprised when Ken draped an honest-to-god cloak around my shoulders before I went outside.
 </p>
<p>
  As he clasped it at my throat with an oak leaf broach, he smiled at me. "This is going to go just fine. Remain calm, be polite and pleasant." He adjusted the fall of the cloak over my shoulders a little. "You look lovely."
 </p>
<p>
  "Thank you," I said quietly.
 </p>
<p>
  "One last thing," Ken said, adjusting my cloak again. "When you invite Oberon into the Hall, be specific about how long he may stay. None of the High Sidhe will take offense at that, and it's a wise precaution to take."
 </p>
<p>
  "Not the grounds?" I asked.
 </p>
<p>
  Ken gestured vaguely. "The grounds are just that…grounds. Oakwood Hall is a home. The rules of hospitality function a bit differently for each."
 </p>
<p>
  I tipped my head a little and frowned. "I'm not sure I understand."
 </p>
<p>
  Ken smiled faintly. "I'm not sure anyone does. It's just the way magic works. Trust me on this."
 </p>
<p>
  "Always," I said firmly, and opened the door.
 </p>
<p>
  Penny padded along beside me and Sparkle perched on my right shoulder as I walked up the drive toward the gates through the chill and fog. I shivered a little and drew the cloak a bit tighter around me, finding it more comfortable than I'd expected.
 </p>
<p>
  "Are we certain it's still August?" Penny asked dryly. It wasn't chill enough for her breath to fog as she spoke, but it almost felt it.
 </p>
<p>
  "This is definitely unusual," I said, then shrugged. "But not horribly so. I don't think it's unnatural."
 </p>
<p>
  "It doesn't really feel unnatural," Sparkle said softly. "But there's a hush that's not just pre-dawn."
 </p>
<p>
  It was awfully quiet. Usually the grounds and woods were full of bird sounds. Now, there wasn't even a breeze to stir the fog. "I think it's just the time of day and weather," I said.
 </p>
<p>
  Penny nodded. "Agreed. The fog is muffling sounds. I can hear small animals in the woods."
 </p>
<p>
  As usual, there were lights in the well-tended flower beds and around the base of the oak trees that grew on the grounds. But where before they'd clearly been electric lights, they now looked more like the magical lights I saw in the fairy village in my clearing. That made me smile, as I guessed that the gnomes from town - and possibly some fairies - had indeed settled in the grounds. I made a mental note to meet them and set some ground rules, so to speak.
 </p>
<p>
  We reached the gates just ahead of sunrise, though the fog was so thick and the sky so obscured that I had to check the time on my phone to be sure of it. But after just a few minutes, Oberon and Puck emerged from the woods and crossed the road.
 </p>
<p>
  As I opened the gates for them, Oberon bowed politely. "Good morning to you, Lady Reid, and to your companions. I hope this morning finds you well."
 </p>
<p>
  "Very well, Lord Oberon," I said politely. "Please, come in."
 </p>
<p>
  Puck was, I noticed, frowning and glancing around uneasily as they entered the grounds. When he saw me watching him, he smiled faintly and shook his head slightly. Since Oberon was ignoring his aide's discomfort, I chose not to say anything, and just led them up to the Hall.
 </p>
<p>
  As I opened the front door and gestured for them to enter, I said, "Please, be welcome in my home to perform your search in my library."
 </p>
<p>
  I thought I saw Puck smirk a little, but Oberon just smiled politely and nodded. "Thank you very kindly, Lady Reid."
 </p>
<p>
  Inside, Ken took my cloak as I led Oberon and Puck over to a pair of doors that now stood between the front door and the kitchen door. I pushed them open and stood to one side, revealing the library. Puck peered in and whistled appreciatively.
 </p>
<p>
  Oberon nodded. "Puck, you will wait with Lady Reid."
 </p>
<p>
  "Of course, m'Lord," Puck bowed deeply.
 </p>
<p>
  Then Oberon looked at me. "With your permission, then?"
 </p>
<p>
  I nodded politely. "We'll leave you to your research. Ken will wait here for you, while the rest of us will wait in the kitchen." I nodded to the next door over.
 </p>
<p>
  "Very good," Oberon, but I wasn't entirely sure he was listening to me anymore. He was already striding into the library and looking around eagerly. Without another word, he closed the doors behind him.
 </p>
<p>
  We stood there in silence for a moment before I looked at Puck and smiled. "Refreshments?"
 </p>
<p>
  Puck looked relieved, his body language relaxing. "That would be lovely, Lady Reid, thank you very much."
 </p>
<p>
  A few minutes later we were sitting comfortably at the table by the fireplace in the kitchen. Penny was sitting in the doorway, and Sparkle was - of course - sitting on the table itself, gobbling down a couple of cookies. I sipped from a mug of tea while Puck picked at a scone.
 </p>
<p>
  "He likes you, you know," Puck said, popping another piece of scone in his mouth. "Most of the mortals he has to deal with are idiots, prepared to make insane deals for the least little scrap of power. My Lord says you think like one of the Sidhe. Which he means as a compliment, by the way."
 </p>
<p>
  Sparkle giggled.
 </p>
<p>
  "I'm not sure I'm entirely comfortable with that," I said honestly, "but I suppose it's better than the alternative."
 </p>
<p>
  "Oh yes," Puck agreed. "There are few things worse than having Lord Oberon dislike you. Except of course having him mad at you." He shivered a little.
 </p>
<p>
  "Not speaking from personal experience, I hope," I said.
 </p>
<p>
  "Oh, not I," Puck said quickly. "My predecessor. My Lord made very certain I knew what happened to him, in excruciating detail."
 </p>
<p>
  Something about the way he said that made me think he meant it literally, and I could tell he was uneasy, so I changed the subject. "How long do you think this will take?"
 </p>
<p>
  Puck sighed. "I honestly don't know, Lady Reid. Between you, me, and Sparkle, my Lord hasn't even told
  <em>
   me
  </em>
  what he's looking for in there. Frankly, I wouldn't mind if it took him the whole day."
 </p>
<p>
  "Bit of a taskmaster?" I asked.
 </p>
<p>
  "You have no idea," he said tiredly, then smiled a little. "Pray you never do. You seem a goodly sort, and you've been very kind to me." He toasted me with his tea mug. "Which I will not forget."
 </p>
<p>
  It was approaching noon, and I was just thinking about offering Puck some lunch, when we heard the library doors bang open and Oberon's voice called, "Puck! Attend!"
 </p>
<p>
  "Guess he's done," Penny said, rising from where she'd been sitting in the doorway.
 </p>
<p>
  Puck was out of the kitchen in an instant, and by the time I emerged he was nodding as Oberon issued instructions to him in a lyrical-sounding language I didn't recognize.
 </p>
<p>
  "Lady Reid," Oberon said, his voice tense with excitement, "I do so hate to be impolite, but I have found what I was looking for and must make use of this information as quickly as possible."
 </p>
<p>
  I shook my head. "If time presses on you, Lord Oberon, say no more. I'm pleased you found what you needed. Ken, the door?"
 </p>
<p>
  "Of course, Caley," Ken said, blurring from where he stood near the library doors to open the front door.
 </p>
<p>
  "Your forbearance in this matter is greatly appreciated, Lady Reid," Oberon said with a bow. "If you will meet me in your clearing at dawn tomorrow morning, we will complete our bargain. You will have your demense."
 </p>
<p>
  And just like that, he departed. "Puck, come!"
 </p>
<p>
  Puck gave me a jaunty little wave as he left. I stood in the doorway, watching them stride up the drive toward the gates, Puck visibly hurrying to keep up with his taller master. Oberon appeared to be speaking rapidly and animatedly, gesturing excitedly with his hands, and Puck was nodding almost constantly.
 </p>
<p>
  I hit the button to open the gates before they reached it, and wasn't at all surprised when they vanished as soon as they passed through it. I pressed the button again to close the gates, stepped back, closed the door, and looked around at my friends. "Is anybody else incredibly uneasy about how excited Oberon seemed to be?"
 </p>
<p>
  "I'm trying not to be," Ken said.
 </p>
<p>
  "He certainly seemed eager to make use of what he found immediately," Penny said.
 </p>
<p>
  Sparkle flopped onto my shoulder and sighed. "Well, if it's bad for someone, it's not for any of us."
 </p>
<p>
  We were all silent for a moment before Ken said, "What was the exact wording of the deal again? The non-disclosure part, if you will."
 </p>
<p>
  I'd already called it to mind myself. "He said '…so long as no one is there to observe what I seek and hope to find. Nor will you or any of your household, any beholden to you, or any in your confidence seek yourselves after the fact to learn what I sought."
 </p>
<span>
<br/>
  Stolen content warning: this tale belongs on Royal Road. Report any occurrences elsewhere.
  <br/>
</span>
<p>
  We were all silent again, then I held up a hand. "I have an idea about that…but regardless I think it should wait until after the deal is complete. Let it go for now. Let's focus on making sure we're ready for tomorrow morning."
 </p>
<p>
  The next morning, we were ready and waiting. At Ken's insistence, I dressed up a little bit, settling for a midway point between my more casual look from the day before and the formal Regency gown. In modern fashion terms it was probably a business suit, but it appeared to have been made in the 1940's, with a linen A-line skirt and a long-sleeved jacket with a cinched and belted waist, both in pine green, over a cream-colored blouse. I finished it with my usual minimal jewelry and a pair of ballet flats that matched the suit.
 </p>
<p>
  I felt I looked reasonably formal, but still pleasantly colorful. The outfit went very well with my hair up in a messy bun, and I wondered about the fact that I seemed to look more natural in older fashions. Or maybe it was just that older fashions flattered my figure better than modern ones.
 </p>
<p>
  Or maybe I just liked the older fashions. In the end, it didn't matter very much, and I put it out of my mind.
 </p>
<p>
  Shine had yet to make her appearance, but Spice had assured us repeatedly that she was more than ready to go. Oberon and Puck arrived promptly with the sunrise and were duly welcomed. Puck looked exhausted, but Oberon seemed energized, relaxed, and very full of himself.
 </p>
<p>
  "I feel I must apologize again for my abrupt departure yesterday, and I do hope you don't mind that I brought Puck to act as witness," Oberon said. "He goes almost everywhere with me, you see."
 </p>
<p>
  "No apology is necessary, Lord Oberon, but I accept it anyway. I am, again, just pleased that you found the information you needed. As for Puck, it's quite all right," I said. "And only fair, considering how many witnesses I have here."
 </p>
<p>
  Oberon laughed. "Yes, quite true! Quite true! And thank you again for your forbearance." He looked around. "I must say, your village looks very festive. But then, it should, considering what a big day it is for you all! So, where is the fairy who will run the race for you?"
 </p>
<p>
  At that very moment, Shine zipped over and came to attention mid-air in front of us. To my amusement, her usual fairy dress had been replaced by tight silver leggings, a matching short-sleeved top, and miniature trainers that were all so shiny they were practically reflective. I supposed even fairy cobblers and tailors must keep up with the times.
 </p>
<p>
  Shine gave me a crisp salute, her wings buzzing excitedly behind her. &lt;&lt;I'm ready, Caley!&gt;&gt;
 </p>
<p>
  I smiled. "Lord Oberon, you've already been introduced to Shine. She'll be making the run for me today."
 </p>
<p>
  For the briefest of moments, I thought I saw surprise and displeasure on Oberon's face. Then he was beaming again. "Well, don't you look sleek, little Shine. And do you belong to Caley properly?"
 </p>
<p>
  Shine lifted her chin proudly and nodded firmly. &lt;&lt;With all my heart!&gt;&gt;
 </p>
<p>
  That made me blush a little, and I was a little relieved that Oberon didn't seem to hear the comment. Instead, he peered at her closely, then looked at me. "Please take no offense, Lady Reid, but I must insist on being certain that she has been called to your service properly. It's vital for the magic of transferring the land to your ownership."
 </p>
<p>
  I held out my hand palm-up. Immediately, Shine alighted on it and placed one foot on the conjoined silver and copper ring that represented the bond that she and Spice shared with me. Immediately, the ring flashed with a brilliant silver radiance that matched her own, and she looked impossibly proud and pleased.
 </p>
<p>
  Again, for just a moment, I thought Oberon looked both surprised and displeased. But then he was smiling warmly. "Lovely, simply lovely. I've rarely seen a bond so strong between one of the Fae and a mortal. May I ask who the other half of the ring represents?"
 </p>
<p>
  "Me," Spice said, landing beside Shine and taking her hand. "We're a package deal."
 </p>
<p>
  Oberon smiled at them, then looked at me curiously. But instead of asking whatever question was in his mind, he said, "You are blessed with devoted followers, Lady Reid. I wish I could rely on some of my own courtiers as surely as you'll be able to rely on yours in the years to come. Very well then…as per the rules of our bargain, Shine will have three minutes to fly as far as she can. Wherever she is at the end of three minutes will mark the radius of the land I will grant to you, Caley, with the clearing that was originally made a safe area for your family as its heart."
 </p>
<p>
  I thought there was something faintly mocking in the way he said it, as if he didn't expect it to be very much land at all.
 </p>
<p>
  "I believe, therefore, that it would be best," he said, "to begin Shine's flight from the edge of the clearing." He gave me a slightly condescending smile. "We wouldn't want anyone saying I cheated you out of a length of what was due you."
 </p>
<p>
  He certainly did seem to be awfully full of himself that morning. "I can't imagine anyone being that foolish, Lord Oberon."
 </p>
<p>
  Oberon laughed, delighted by my comment…but behind him, a small smirk appeared on Puck's face, and he gave me an appreciative little nod.
 </p>
<p>
  At the edge of the clearing, Shine hovered in the narrow strip between the fairy ring and my ward line, stretching and arching her back. Almost the entire population of the village was clustered in a tight semi-circle behind us, waving silver and green flags and pennants. Their excitement was palpable.
 </p>
<p>
  "With your permission," Oberon said politely, "I'll place a tracking and observation spell on your pretty little proxy. That way, we may follow and observe her progress, and she can know when her race is done. You have my word that the spell will do nothing else, and I will remove it as soon as the race is over and Shine is safely back with us."
 </p>
<p>
  "That would be appreciated, Lord Oberon," I replied.
 </p>
<p>
  He gestured and Shine's aura flashed gold for a moment before returning to its normal silver. Between us, an image of her - from behind, as if looking over her shoulder - appeared in mid-air.
 </p>
<p>
  "That's a very impressive piece of magic," I said appreciatively.
 </p>
<p>
  Oberon looked pleased, but waved dismissively. "It's nothing, really. Just a little thing." He smiled. "When you're ready."
 </p>
<p>
  I nodded to him. "On your mark, Lord Oberon."
 </p>
<p>
  He returned my nod graciously, then looked at Shine. "Are you prepared, little one?"
 </p>
<p>
  She gave him a thumbs-up without turning to look at him, entirely focused on the woods beyond the clearing.
 </p>
<p>
  Spice and Sparkle landed on my shoulders, and I could suddenly feel Spice's tension and excitement with crystal clarity. She was worried for Shine's safety, but incredibly proud of her…and proud that I'd see some of what they were capable of first-hand.
 </p>
<p>
  "Ready," Oberon said.
 </p>
<p>
  Shine tensed, crouching mid-air into a sprinter's ready posture, her body quivering with restrained energy and excitement, wings buzzing.
 </p>
<p>
  "Go!" Oberon called cheerfully.
 </p>
<p>
  Almost before he finished the word, there was an audible report - not quite the crack of a supersonic bullet, more like the crisp snap of a flag suddenly caught in a gale - and Shine was gone, leaving a bright but fading streak of silver in her wake. A countdown appeared at the top of the magical image of her, starting at 3:00 and immediately beginning to tick down.
 </p>
<p>
  Oberon blinked several times, his mouth opening a little.
 </p>
<p>
  In the image floating between us, Shine was stretched straight out, arms tucked tightly to her sides, her wings a vague blur above her silver back…and the world around her was a blur. We saw glimpses of trees and branches as she maneuvered around them, but for the most part her course was a straight line out from where she'd started.
 </p>
<p>
  Something large and black dropped into view from above her, but she was past it before it got close to her. A black blob appeared in front of her and she folded her arms across her head, brilliant silver light flaring in front of her. Then she was through into open air again, black goo rapidly evaporating off of her.
 </p>
<p>
  "What was that?" I asked.
 </p>
<p>
  Oberon gestured and a second image appeared, wound back a few seconds, and ran in slow motion.
 </p>
<p>
  What appeared to be some sort of giant spider was centered in the frame above her, its legs curled to grasp her, but even in that single image she was already past it and moving so quickly that she'd've been long gone before it passed through the space where she'd been. In shape it seemed to resemble a black widow, and looked enormous compared to her.
 </p>
<p>
  A second one was dropping behind the first, and had a bit more lead time. It looked like it was going to catch her when she folded her arms and the silver light flared in front of her…and she blew clean through it. Thus the black goo that had been evaporating off of her.
 </p>
<p>
  "My goodness," Oberon grunted. "Not every resident of your new demense will be friendly. I'm afraid you'll likely have some work making it safe for habitation."
 </p>
<p>
  When I glanced over at him, his expression was a mixture of surprise and displeasure, and I realized two things: First, I hadn't stipulated no interference in her flight, and second, he hadn't promised not to. Granted, I didn't know for certain - and probably never would - that he was responsible for the attack…but somehow, I was sure of it.
 </p>
<p>
  He saw me watching and his expression was suddenly good cheer and surprise, as if the displeasure had never been there at all. "She's considerably faster than I was anticipating!"
 </p>
<p>
  "She's faster than even I knew," I agreed, and returned to watching. There was nothing I could do now but trust her.
 </p>
<p>
  On my shoulder, Spice was practically vibrating with pride and awe. I guessed that even she didn't know how fast Shine could really go when pressed. But Spice, at least, didn't seem the least bit worried about her partner…so I let go of my concern as well.
 </p>
<p>
  Or at least, as much as I could.
 </p>
<p>
  Time seemed to slow as we watched her zoom through the trees. Three more times things tried to stop her: First, something that looked like a hunting snare went off behind her; then she spun neatly through a series of choke-lines being held taught by a group of ugly little beings that Sparkle identified as redcaps; and finally, she ducked effortlessly beneath the swing of a club held by an unpleasantly familiar-looking ogre.
 </p>
<p>
  Maybe I should've killed the thing after all.
 </p>
<p>
  But none of them really came close to her, and none of them diverted her from her course…or even slowed her down particularly. If anything, each attack pushed her to go faster and fly harder than she already was. The ogre's attack came barely a minute and a half into her flight, and after that the only things that almost stopped her were trees and branches that she had to swerve to avoid.
 </p>
<p>
  At the speed she was going, even that was a challenge.
 </p>
<p>
  Then the countdown in the magical image read 0:00 and Oberon called, "Time!"
 </p>
<p>
  Shine immediately dipped toward the ground, circling around and slowing, landing - probably precisely - at the point where Oberon had called the end of the race.
 </p>
<p>
  She promptly dropped to her knees, her wings shaking and slumping as she toppled over onto her side and her silver aura winked out.
 </p>
<p>
  I gasped. "Penny -"
 </p>
<p>
  "I've got her," Penny said at the same time, vanishing into my shadow and reappearing almost instantly from the shadow of a tree near Shine. She shifted to her human form and scooped the little silver fairy up in her hands before stepping back into the tree's shadow.
 </p>
<p>
  When the magical image turned black, Oberon gestured, dispelling it. "Well," he said slowly, "that was something to see."
 </p>
<p>
  His good cheer sounded strained to my ears, but I didn't care. I was already turning as Penny melted up out of my shadow and held Shine out to me. "I think she's just exhausted."
 </p>
<p>
  As she carefully deposited Shine in my cupped hands, the little silver fairy held up one trembling arm and gave me a shaky thumbs up. &lt;&lt;So tired,&gt;&gt; she murmured.
 </p>
<p>
  "You were incredible," I said softly to her. Her silver glow immediately reappeared and she smiled up at me.
 </p>
<p>
  Spice landed beside her, knelt down, and propped her up into a sitting position. "That was amazing," Spice said simply, then kissed her deeply.
 </p>
<p>
  I smiled down at them, then looked up at Oberon. He was just releasing a deep breath, and his expression was dark. "She traveled," he said, his tone a mixture of awe, astonishment, and displeasure, "slightly over three miles in three minutes."
 </p>
<p>
  My brain did the math almost before I asked it to. Shine had been doing about 60 mph.
 </p>
<p>
  Oberon shook his head in amazement. "I've only rarely seen fairies fly at half of that speed. You have something special there, Lady Reid." For a moment, I thought he was going to explode in anger…then his expression opened and brightened.
 </p>
<p>
  He slapped his thigh and began to laugh. "Well played, Lady Caitlyn Reid, well played indeed. And worth it! Worth it not only for the information, but to have seen that fairy fly that fast with my own eyes." He smiled at me. "The land is yours, though as you've seen, you may need to make peace with the inhabitants before it will be safe to truly make use of."
 </p>
<p>
  As he said it, I
  <em>
   felt
  </em>
  it. There was a sudden awareness of the land around me lurking in the back of my mind, ready to provide me with information in an instant, and a feeling of untapped power thrumming beneath my feet.
 </p>
<p>
  I may have gasped and must have staggered a little, because Sparkle was suddenly human-sized and steading me with an arm around my back. But she didn't feel worried…she just felt proud. Proud of me.
 </p>
<p>
  "Name your land, Caitlyn Reid," Oberon said. "Name your land and seal the bargain."
 </p>
<p>
  "Faeflight," I said, the name just popping out of me without any thought. As soon as I said it though, it felt right.
 </p>
<p>
  Oberon chuckled. "Very apt."
 </p>
<p>
  I looked up at him. I knew that he knew he'd been played a bit…but he didn't seem particularly upset by it. We had, after all, followed the letter of the bargain perfectly.
 </p>
<p>
  And he'd gotten what he needed out of it. If anything, I thought there was new respect in his expression. Respect, curiosity, and calculation, behind the jovial mien. And I knew to be more cautious of him in the future…maybe he hadn't planned all four of those attempts to sabotage Shine's flight, but he didn't seem put out by them either.
 </p>
<p>
  Things to worry about another day.
