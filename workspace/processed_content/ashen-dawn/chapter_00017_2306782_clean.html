 <p>
  <span>
   When Argent half-dragged, half-carried Kaelan from the shadowed alley, Vertigo's first thought was that she'd been wounded. He rushed forward, already scanning for injuries, only to freeze in confusion at the sight before him.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Blue-white energy crackled across Kaelan's skin in unpredictable patterns. Her hair, usually smooth and controlled, now floated around her head like she was underwater, charged with static electricity. Her silver eyes, normally sharp and focused, glowed with an unearthly light, pupils dilated and unfocused. The air around her seemed to warp and shimmer, charged with potential that raised the hair on his arms even from several feet away.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What the hell happened?" he demanded, looking to Argent for answers. "Was she attacked? Poisoned?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Liquor happened," Argent replied grimly, struggling to maintain her grip as Kaelan swayed dangerously. "Lots of it. They kept pouring drinks and we couldn't refuse without blowing our cover."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "This is from
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    drinking?
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   " Vertigo stared in disbelief as a small arc of lightning jumped from Kaelan's fingertips to a nearby metal post, leaving a scorch mark. "She's... drunk?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Very," Argent confirmed, wincing as another spark snapped from Kaelan's shoulder to her hand. "And losing control of her powers. We need to get her somewhere isolated, now."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo had never even considered this could happen. Angels were hunters, soldiers in a cosmic war that had raged since before human civilization. The idea that one could be laid low by something as mundane as alcohol was... well, it was almost funny. If it wasn't potentially fatal.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I didn't know this could happen," he admitted, cautiously approaching Kaelan, who swayed dangerously, muttering something incomprehensible in what sounded like Celestial. The air felt charged, like the moment before a lightning strike, and he could taste metal on his tongue.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Neither did I until tonight," Argent said, her indigo eyes scanning the street nervously. "Apparently it's not something angels advertise."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan looked up suddenly, her silver eyes fixing on Vertigo with alarming intensity. "Ver-ti-go," she slurred, each syllable carefully formed as though she was trying to remember how human speech worked. A crackle of energy danced across her lips as she spoke.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That's me," he confirmed, unable to hide his unease. "Let's get you somewhere safe, okay?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She frowned, her brow furrowing in concentration. "Not... safe. I'm not safe." The words were followed by a small burst of electrical discharge that scorched the cobblestones at her feet.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Don't touch her directly," Argent warned as Vertigo moved to support Kaelan's other side. "The discharge can be painful. I've been grounding some of it through my storm affinity, but it's getting stronger."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo quickly removed his leather gloves and offered them to Argent. "Put these on. I'll take her weight."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Despite his complete lack of preparation for this situation, his mind raced through tactical options with surprising clarity. They needed isolation, containment, and time. The abandoned mill they'd scouted earlier presented their best option. It was remote enough to avoid witnesses, with a stone foundation that might help ground electrical discharge.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "This way," he directed, cautiously positioning himself to support Kaelan without direct skin contact. He used his cloak as an insulating layer, wrapping it around her shoulders despite the discomfort of occasional sparks burning through the fabric. "Keep to the shadows."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   They moved awkwardly through the darkened streets, Kaelan's limbs seemingly disconnected from her body's intended movements. Her head rolled back at one point, and Vertigo caught a glimpse of her face â€“ eyes closed, expression almost peaceful despite the chaos beneath her skin. The contrast was jarring. Here was the angel who'd dismissed him as a half-breed mongrel, now helpless and dependent on his protection.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A patrol of city guards passed at the end of the street, and Vertigo pulled both women deeper into the darkness of a recessed doorway. Kaelan's power flared in response to the sudden movement, and he felt the hair on his arms stand up as the electrical field intensified. Argent pressed her palm against the nearest stone wall, her expression tightening with concentration. Slowly, the electrical energy around them diminished slightly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What are you doing?" Vertigo whispered.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Channeling some of it into the ground," Argent replied through gritted teeth. "Storm affinity. But I can't keep this up for long."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The guards passed without incident, their boots echoing on the cobblestones. Vertigo waited until their voices faded completely before moving again.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You said something about being the Angel of Storms," he panted as they half-carried, half-dragged her through back alleys. "Kaelan said that blue-haired angel was the Angel of Light. Do you all have something like that? Why isn't she the Angel of Storms, I mean, look at her?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Argent shook her head. "That's just a regular lightning affinity. She's the Angel of Chaos."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Figures," he grumbled. "She certainly causes enough bullshit."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The night air grew damp as clouds gathered overhead, responding to Argent's presence. A light drizzle began to fall, helping to dissipate some of the electrical charge in the air. Kaelan suddenly went limp between them, her head lolling forward.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Is she unconscious?" Vertigo asked, alarmed.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I don't think so," Argent replied, adjusting her grip. "More like... cycling between states. The energy builds, discharges, then her system resets briefly before it starts again."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As if on cue, Kaelan's head snapped up, her eyes blazing with renewed intensity. "
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    Du kamathar nadhiroth bashirak
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   ," she muttered, the Celestial words crackling with power.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What does that mean?" Vertigo asked, struggling to maintain his hold as she began to thrash.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Something about betrayal," Argent translated vaguely. "She's not making sense."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   They passed through a narrow space between two buildings, emerging onto a deserted lane that led away from the city center. The buildings grew more sparse here, many abandoned or in disrepair. In the distance, the silhouette of the abandoned mill rose against the night sky, its broken wheel a jagged shadow against the clouds.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo found himself studying Kaelan as they walked, trying to reconcile this vulnerable, unpredictable figure with the cold, controlled warrior he'd come to know. He'd never imagined her like this, her power uncontained, defenses down, the carefully maintained walls she'd built around herself literally crackling with destabilized energy. He'd resented her rigid control, her seemingly effortless discipline. He'd interpreted her restraint as arrogance, her caution as condescension. But watching her now, electricity discharging in painful bursts she couldn't contain, her expression caught between concentration and distress, he began to understand that maybe her control wasn't about superiority. Maybe it was about survival.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The mill loomed before them, a hulking shadow against the night sky. Its stone walls were partially collapsed in places, the wooden roof sagging dangerously. The massive wheel that had once driven the mill's machinery hung askew, half-submerged in the small stream that still flowed beneath it. Years of neglect had left the structure more skeleton than building, but its stone foundation remained solid.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo pushed open the warped wooden door with his shoulder, wincing as it groaned on rusted hinges. Inside, the air was stale and heavy with dust. Moonlight filtered through gaps in the roof, illuminating the remains of machinery, wooden beams, and forgotten tools scattered across the stone floor.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Over here," he said, guiding them toward a relatively clear space near the center of the main room. "Set her down carefully."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Together, they lowered Kaelan to the floor. She curled onto her side immediately, knees drawn up to her chest, fingers splayed against the stone as if seeking purchase. The electrical discharge around her intensified, blue-white light casting stark shadows across the abandoned machinery.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "This is getting worse," Argent said, worry evident in her voice. "I don't know how much longer I can help contain it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo surveyed their surroundings with new purpose. The mill's stone foundation and remote location made it their best option, but he knew as they reached it that simple isolation wouldn't be enough. Kaelan's power was growing more unstable by the minute, blue-white arcs of lightning dancing across her skin and jumping to nearby metal with increasing frequency.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Taking one last look at Kaelan's trembling form, he began to move through the abandoned structure, taking in the rusted machinery, collapsed wooden beams, and scattered tools left behind when the mill had ceased operations. His mind, usually focused on combat tactics, shifted into a different kind of problem-solving mode.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Working quickly, he gathered what he could find: metal tools abandoned by the millers, lengths of copper wire from machinery, iron fixtures from the walls. A lifetime of scavenging under Commander's tutelage had taught him to find value in discarded things. He remembered watching Nathan repair electrical equipment in camp, the smaller man's hands moving with practiced precision as he explained the principles of conductivity, resistance, grounding.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What are you doing?" Argent asked, watching him arrange metal objects in a rough circle around where Kaelan now lay, occasional sparks still dancing across her skin.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Creating a conduction path," he explained, connecting pieces with wire. "If I can't stop the discharge, maybe I can direct it." He had no idea if his makeshift solution would work, but inaction wasn't an option. The years he'd spent watching Nathan work with tools and wires were finally proving useful. He tried to remember everything Commander had ever taught him about elemental powers and their physical manifestations.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Elements seek balance," Commander had said once, during one of their rare quiet moments. They'd been sitting by a fire, Vertigo nursing fresh burns after a training session gone wrong. "They don't want to destroy, they want to find equilibrium. Guide them, don't fight them." He'd dismissed it as another of Commander's cryptic philosophies. Now, as he twisted metal scraps into a crude circuit, creating a path of least resistance for the electrical energy to follow, those words resonated with new meaning.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Will it hold?" Argent asked, her indigo eyes tracking his movements with cautious hope.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I don't know," he admitted, connecting the final pieces of his makeshift containment system. Metal objects of various sizes and shapes now formed a complete circle around Kaelan, connected by lengths of copper wire that spiraled outward to more distant grounding points embedded in the stone floor. "But it's better than nothing."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The work was methodical, almost meditative. Strip wire here, twist a connection there, test the path with a small piece of metal to make sure the circuit was complete. It reminded him of the repairs he'd watched Nathan perform on camp equipment, the same careful attention to detail, the same understanding that small mistakes could have large consequences.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan mumbled something incomprehensible, then looked up with unfocused eyes. A surge of energy built around her as blue-white light pulsed beneath her skin, causing the air to crackle ominously. The air around her grew dense with potential, the taste of metal and ozone flooding Vertigo's mouth. Small objects nearby â€“ dust, pebbles, splinters of wood â€“ began to rise, suspended in the charged field around her.
  </span>
 </p>

  <br/>
 </span>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Get back," Vertigo warned Argent, stepping away from the circle himself.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The discharge came in a blinding flash, arcing from Kaelan to the nearest metal objects. For a terrible moment, Vertigo thought his makeshift system would fail, overwhelmed by the sheer power of her uncontrolled release. But to his relief, the improvised circuit redirected much of the energy along the prepared pathways, dispersing it into the stone floor. The air crackled and popped, and the scent of ozone intensified, but the worst of the surge was contained.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It worked," Argent said, sounding genuinely impressed.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "This time," he replied grimly. "How long does this usually last?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I have no idea. This is my first angelic drinking crisis too."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A hysterical laugh bubbled up in Vertigo's throat, but he swallowed it down. The absurdity of the situation wasn't lost on him. His life had taken many strange turns since Commander had found him, but babysitting a drunk, electricity-leaking angel ranked among the strangest.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Outside, the rain intensified, drumming against the mill's damaged roof. Water began to seep through in places, forming puddles on the stone floor. Argent moved to position herself where she could block the worst of the leaks from reaching Kaelan or the electrical circuit.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Kaelan." Vertigo kept his voice steady, crouching just outside the circle of metal conductors. Her head moved at the sound of her name, silver eyes unfocused but seeking his face. "Can you understand me?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She responded in Celestial, the liquid syllables incomprehensible to him, then seemed frustrated when he didn't understand. Sparks danced more intensely around her.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I can't understand that language," he said calmly. "Try again. Common tongue."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She frowned in concentration. "Dangerous," she finally managed, the word slurred but recognizable. "Stay... away."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "We're safe," he assured her. "You're contained. Just focus on breathing."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Her gaze drifted past him to the improvised containment system. For a moment, lucidity seemed to return to her expression and surprise crossed her face, followed by something that might have been grudging approval. "Smart," she murmured. Then, unexpectedly: "Sorry."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Before he could respond, another wave of energy built around her, and she curled forward, arms wrapped around herself as though trying to physically contain the power building within.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It's okay," he said, though he wasn't sure she could still hear him. "I've got this."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   And to his own surprise, he meant it.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Hours passed. The night deepened, broken only by the rhythmic drumming of rain against the mill's roof and the periodic surges of Kaelan's power. Each time she discharged, Vertigo tensed, watching anxiously as his improvised system strained to channel the energy safely away. So far it had held, but he couldn't be certain how long the makeshift conductors would last.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Argent had finally succumbed to exhaustion, curled asleep in the corner farthest from Kaelan's electrical field. The storm outside had intensified, lightning occasionally flashing through the gaps in the roof, thunder rolling across the sky in sympathetic response to the energy in the room.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo maintained his vigil, making small adjustments to the conduction paths as needed, observing the gradually diminishing intensity of the discharges. The electrical surges were coming less frequently now, but still powerful enough to require his constant attention.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Between episodes, he found moments to rest, leaning against one of the mill's support columns. His body ached with fatigue, but his mind remained alert, processing everything he'd witnessed. This night had revealed vulnerabilities he'd never suspected, not just in Kaelan, but in the entire angelic structure she represented.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Angels weren't invulnerable. They had weaknesses, flaws, limitations. The knowledge should have been satisfying, vindicating even. Instead, it prompted an uncomfortable reassessment of his assumptions about power, about strength, about what it meant to be in control.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   In the flickering blue-white light of Kaelan's power, he studied her with new eyes. She'd always seemed invulnerable to him, confident, controlled, untouchable. The perfect angel looking down on his half-breed imperfection. He'd resented that perceived superiority, pushed against her authority at every opportunity.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Yet here she was, as vulnerable as he'd ever seen anyone. Her power â€“ the very source of her strength â€“ transformed into weakness through one simple human pleasure she couldn't safely enjoy. What else didn't he know about her? What other vulnerabilities did she hide behind that mask of perfect control? For the first time, he found himself genuinely curious about the person behind the warrior facade.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   During a moment of relative calm, Kaelan's eyes opened, more lucid than they had been all night. "You're still here," she said, her voice hoarse but clearer than before.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Where else would I be?" he replied, surprised by the question.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She studied him with an intensity that made him uncomfortable. "Most would run."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I'm not most people," he said simply.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "No," she agreed, her gaze steady despite her condition. "You're not."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The words hung between them, carrying more weight than their simple meaning suggested. There was something like recognition in her voice, an acknowledgment that maybe she'd been wrong about some things.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A particularly strong discharge interrupted the moment, arcing from her fingertips to the nearest conductor. The metal glowed briefly, white-hot from the energy passing through it. Out of instinct more than thought, he reached out with his own fire affinity, not to create flame but to absorb heat, drawing some of the excess energy into himself. It was a dangerous gamble. Fire and lightning weren't the same element, but they shared certain properties, a resonance he could feel rather than explain. He closed his eyes, focusing on the sensation of heat, and imagined pulling it toward himself, redirecting it through his own body and into the ground.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   For an instant, he felt connected to Kaelan in a way that transcended physical proximity: an awareness of her energy flowing through him, wild and electric, unlike his own steadier, hotter fire but not entirely alien. It was like hearing a different dialect of a language he already knew, familiar yet distinct.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The effort left him light-headed, his own energy depleted. He leaned back against a wooden pillar, watching as Kaelan's eyes drifted closed again. The discharge had been less intense than previous ones, the system better able to handle it with his assistance.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   In the silence that followed, broken only by the rain and the occasional crackle of electricity, Vertigo found himself thinking of Commander.
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    Is this what you wanted?
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   he thought, imagining the man's knowing smirk.
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    Is this why you paired us together?
   </span>
  </em>
  <span>
   No answer came, of course. Commander had always had his reasons, often kept to himself until the last possible moment or beyond. Had he known something like this might happen? Had he anticipated that Vertigo would need to use his power in ways he'd never attempted before?
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The rain gradually lessened, the storm moving off to the east. Through gaps in the clouds, stars appeared, cold and distant. Vertigo checked the circuit again, adjusting a connection that had weakened, and settled back into his watchful routine.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan mumbled something in her sleep, or whatever state she was in. Her voice was different now, softer, without the authority she typically wielded like a weapon.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What?" Vertigo asked, not expecting an answer.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It's too much," she murmured, eyes still closed. "Always too much."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He wasn't sure if she was referring to her current situation or something deeper. Her expression shifted, lips pressing together in a grimace. Vertigo remained silent, sensing he was witnessing something not meant for his ears, but he found himself wondering about what it meant to live so long with such rigid control, such high expectations. What did it cost to be perfect all the time?
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The night deepened, then began to soften toward dawn. Vertigo fought to stay alert, jerking awake several times as his head drooped toward his chest. Each time, his first instinct was to check the circuit, to ensure Kaelan was still contained and safe.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dawn broke, pale light filtering through the mill's broken roof. Vertigo, exhausted but vigilant, noticed immediately when Kaelan's breathing pattern changed, shifting from the heavy rhythm of unconsciousness to the lighter cadence of awareness. He straightened, uncertain what to expect.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Her eyes opened gradually, no longer glowing silver but still reflecting the morning light. For several moments, she remained perfectly still, clearly taking inventory of her surroundings and condition before moving. Assessment before action, even now. When she finally pushed herself to a sitting position, her movements were careful, controlled. Her gaze fell on the circle of metal conductors surrounding her, then moved to the scorch marks on the stone floor. Understanding dawned in her expression, immediately followed by something he'd never seen there before: shame.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "How bad was it?" Her voice was rough, barely above a whisper.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Could have been worse," he replied neutrally, offering neither accusation nor false reassurance. "The containment worked."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Her eyes moved to his improvised system again, then back to him. "You made this?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He nodded once.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Without prior knowledge of the condition."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   It wasn't a question, but he answered anyway. "First time seeing it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Something complicated passed across her expression â€“ embarrassment, perhaps, or vulnerability quickly suppressed. When she spoke again, her voice had regained some of its usual crispness. "No lasting damage, then?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Nothing that won't heal." He gestured to a few small burns on his hands and forearms, gained during his more experimental attempts at energy management.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She flinched slightly at the sight. "I should have warned you."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Yes," he agreed simply. "You should have."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The acknowledgment hung between them. Argent stirred in her corner, awakened by their voices, but remained silent, watching their interaction with wary interest.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan sat with rigid posture at the edge of the circle, all traces of intoxication gone, replaced by tightly controlled composure. Across from her, Vertigo waited silently, neither pushing nor retreating from the uncomfortable conversation.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It's an interaction between alcohol and my magic," she finally said, her tone clinically detached as though discussing someone else entirely. "The ethanol disrupts the normal containment mechanisms."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "In normal person language?" Vertigo prompted.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A flash of irritation crossed her face, then reluctant acknowledgment. "When I drink, I lose control of my powers. The more I drink, the worse it gets. Eventually, the discharge becomes... dangerous."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I noticed," he replied dryly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It's not something angels discuss openly," she continued after a moment. "Power vulnerabilities are considered... private."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "So private you didn't think to mention it before an information-gathering mission in a tavern?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The challenge hung between them. To his surprise, she didn't deflect or dismiss it. "I miscalculated," she admitted. "I thought I could avoid drinking entirely or limit it to an amount I could control. I was wrong."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The simple acknowledgment of error landed with unexpected weight. In all the time he'd known her, he'd never heard Kaelan admit to being wrong about anything, much less a tactical miscalculation that could have endangered the mission.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "How do you usually handle it?" he asked, his tone softening slightly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Abstinence," she replied with a hint of dry humor. "Or very, very careful moderation in controlled environments." After a pause, she added, "I haven't had an episode this severe in nearly a century."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Lucky me," he remarked, but there was no real heat in it.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Argent approached cautiously, still keeping a respectful distance. "How are you feeling?" she asked Kaelan.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Functional," Kaelan replied, which Vertigo suspected was angelic for 'absolutely terrible but I refuse to admit it.' She ran a hand through her hair, which had returned to its usual smooth silver, though it hung limper than normal. Her movements were precise but lacked their usual fluid grace, suggesting she was still recovering from the night's events.
  </span>
 </p>

   "The information," she said suddenly, abruptly shifting focus with characteristic efficiency. "What did we actually get before... events overtook us?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Argent detailed what they'd learned while Vertigo listened attentively, mentally mapping the implications for their mission. Despite her recovered composure, Kaelan seemed content to let Argent lead the debriefing, a small but significant departure from her usual need for control.

   "They're moving the captives tomorrow night," Argent concluded.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The medical supplies?" Vertigo asked.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Separate location," Argent replied. "Eastern warehouse, lighter security but more complicated access."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Enough to work with," Vertigo concluded when Argent finished.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaelan nodded once, a gesture that might have seemed dismissive before but now read more like genuine agreement. "We should move soon. The tavern incident may have drawn unwanted attention." Her eyes met his briefly, and he saw a flicker of something that was not quite gratitude, but acknowledgment. An unspoken message passed between them:
  </span>
  <em>
   <span>
    We're not discussing this again, but I know what you did.
   </span>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Vertigo rose to his feet, wincing at the stiffness in his muscles after hours of vigilance. He began dismantling the circuit, collecting the pieces that might still be useful.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Leave it," Kaelan said, her voice startling him. "I hope not, but we might need it again."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He paused, then nodded. She was recognizing value in what he'd created, in the knowledge and skill it represented. It wasn't praise, exactly, but it was something. A recognition that maybe he brought more to the table than just muscle and a bad attitude.
  </span>
 </p>

   As they gathered their limited supplies, Vertigo noticed that neither woman had directly mentioned the events of the night. Yet those events had clearly altered something fundamental in their dynamic, a shift felt rather than acknowledged, influencing how they moved around each other, how decisions were being made. The perfect, untouchable warrior he'd resented was gone, replaced by someone more complex, more human. Someone who made mistakes, who had vulnerabilities, who needed help sometimes. And for reasons he couldn't quite articulate, that made all the difference.

   Sunlight streamed through the broken roof as they prepared to leave, catching on the metal circuit around the scorched stone floor.
