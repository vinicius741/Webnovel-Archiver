<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnNhZWY0ZjljMjJkMTRjMjQ5ZjI2MGM5ZGZkNmY5Zjk3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Night had fallen upon Zephyr, and with it came the usual chill and quiet. The light of the moon and stars gave a quiet, mysterious illumination to the city streets, more than enough for someone with Terrance’s familiarity with the dark. Unlike Cloudreach, there were still some people milling about - there was an active night life here in Zephyr, it seemed, which was both boon and bane for operations like tonight’s. At least it meant that walking through the streets with a cloak and hood didn’t stand out at all. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxMWZjZWJlYmExNjQwMGQ4OTMwNWM4NDJmMTgxNTNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“This next left,” Parlor murmured invisibly, keeping pace effortlessly next to Terrance as he led Maeryn and Ernesto through the streets. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmYTkxMGNmNWQyZDQ2ZjJhZGEyMjNlOTI4Mjc3NWNm"><span style="font-weight: 400">The rogue gave the ghost the slightest of nods, following the directions smoothly. As long as he and his companions kept to the side of the street, they wouldn’t be noticed. Even so, Terrance remained on high alert; if the ZRC had sent assassins after Samuel Parlor, retainer to the royal family, then they certainly would be watching his known associates… including Charles Camlus, the man whose home they would be infiltrating tonight. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzZGEzODJmNGNhYzRlYTQ4Njc5ZjNmZjhmOTVkNzYy"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance’s mind continued to chew on the implications of what he’d learned so far as he quietly followed Parlor’s guidance. The royal family had feared that the Zephyr Research Council was taking advantage of the Mist crisis to gain power. That made sense. When your country depended on the success of a single organization, that organization naturally gained resources and power. The more desperate the country became, the more power the organization would acquire. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyZGIwNGVjNzZkMDRiOWE4YzVlYzRiMmY3NmVlYWEx"><span style="font-weight: 400">And with the looming need for the cities to either start trading with Geova again, or land to acquire its own resources, Zephyria was becoming desperate indeed. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZGM4NDdkMjQzYjRhNDk4YjNiYzY3MzIzNTQ0Yzhh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance took the next right at Parlor’s word, noticing that there were fewer and fewer people on the street as they went along. Right. They were leaving the main streets where business actually took place. He edged closer to the buildings on the side of the street, trying to blend in better, and listened carefully to make sure that Ernesto and Maeryn did the same. Their footsteps were still too loud - especially Ernesto’s - but they were making an effort. </span></p>
<p class="cnMzMTMxYWE5ZmMzZDRmMDViNjBhZTZhOWU1OTAxYjE5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Satisfied for the moment, Terrance returned to his musings about the ZRC and its sociopolitical maneuverings to gain power. No, that all made sense… to a point. There were diminishing returns after a while - there had to be. There was only so much power an organization could be given before it effectively usurped control of the country, and that was something that the royal family would not permit. The ZRC had probably been given everything it was possible to give at this point. </span></p>
<p class="cnM0M2FmMTI4MTEyYjRkNGQ5ODFiMTEwNGM5MTViMDlm"><span style="font-weight: 400">So… why assassinate Samuel Parlor over an auditing irregularity? That kind of thing would barely turn any heads unless it was truly massive. It would be written off as someone embezzling funds, and it would take months - maybe years - to track it down. And with the inevitable success of the ZRC in defeating the Mist, they could ride out or quash that kind of scandal entirely. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjNmNmODIwOWI5ZjRiODZiZTNjYjgyOGYyNjczYzYz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Unless… did the ZRC believe that Parlor had been the one to kill Keith Laurant? That he’d singlehandedly tracked down the facility from that audit, slew the Undead, and was on his way to report it to the royal family? Yes… that made more sense, and it fit the timeline. The ZRC performing experiments with and on the Undead would be a massive blow, and give the royal family all the excuse it needed to take power away. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjYjE3NmZlYjc0OTQwNDZhN2E2MjgzN2UyNmIzZTgx"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a flash of movement in the corner of Terrance’s eye, and his heart rate spiked as he jerked his head a couple of degrees to the side to try to catch a better glimpse of it. He let out a slow breath and rolled his eyes when he realized it was just a couple of teenagers making out in an alley. Shaking his head, he continued on. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxZTE5NWI3NzYzNTRlYTg4ODBjYmZjODA5YmMwYzZl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Almost there,” Parlor whispered, sounding vaguely excited. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyZmNhZjg1YTFhZTRlMGRiZTA4YzM1NDFiODBkYzI5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance nodded. He needed to focus on the mission tonight. Still, though… part of him wondered exactly when the ZRC was planning on revealing their strategy for dealing with the Mist. There was only a year or so left before Critical Mana Depletion, and at that point the mana barriers wouldn’t be effective at keeping the Mist away. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlOTNhM2RjOWU5ZjQyMGJiMDhkZGRmYWZmN2IzZmZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Surely, they had to have a plan, right? If they didn’t, then there should have been more of a scramble, more hands-on management from the top, more coordination between teams… something. But he hadn’t found any evidence of any of that during his time on Airspire. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1YTZlOTVkMDljNjQzNzY4NWM0OWYxYTM2NzY4ZDlm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance scowled. Something didn’t add up. He just wasn’t sure what he was missing, yet. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyNWNlZmE5ODliNjQ2YmRhMTQ0YTYzMmIxOGFjYjg0"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here we are.” Parlor reemerged into visibility, leading the way up a small set of steps towards a small mansion, comparable in size to the Nightshade estate. Terrance ran his eyes across it with a critical eye, looking for entry points. Four floors tall, but a little less wide, overall. Plenty of windows… he could use his </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Spider Climb </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">spell and get in through any of them, perhaps. People didn’t tend to secure their windows as well as they did their doors. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiMDM0YzJiZDk1OTRkZWRiOTdiZDkxMTk1NzhmMGNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, down the stairs, unlock the door, and let Maeryn and Ernesto inside. Yes. That should work. He could reverse the process when it was time to leave, and leave little trace he’d ever been there. He nodded, satisfied with the plan. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxYjI5MDU5Y2NjNDRmYTJiZGI5ZGU3ZDkzZjJlNGIy"><span style="font-weight: 400">But first things first, he needed to determine if anyone was home and awake. “Go crouch near those bushes,” he ordered quietly. “I’m gonna scout things out, then I’ll get the door open for you. Parlor, you can follow me, but stay invisible and be careful not to glide through anything. We’re leaving no trace.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyOTUzODZhZWEzYjQ1MTdhYzhiYmFkY2RiODIwYjNl"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Got it,” Maeryn murmured, retreating and blending in with the bushes that Terrance had pointed out. Ernesto did the same. </span></p>
<p class="cnNlOWI3ZWU1MTk3YjQzOWY4MDc0YTdhZjYyNzBkYmJj"><span style="font-weight: 400">Parlor rubbed his hands together eagerly, a delighted smile crossing his face. “Excellent.” He popped back out of sight, and Terrance channeled mana into his hands, elbows, knees and feet, voicelessly casting </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Spider Climb. </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">He quickly clambered up the building, peeking into all the windows and determining that yes, no one seemed to be up and about. There was a middle-aged man sleeping on the topmost floor in the master bedroom - presumably Charles Camlus - and two live-in servants on the third floor. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxZmU1Y2JmNTBhOTQ3YWFhNTA0NTliYmM5NDQ4M2Uw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance made a mental note of their locations, then retreated back to the second floor windows. As expected, he found one that wasn’t locked, and quietly opened it, sliding in and landing on his feet as noiselessly as he could. </span></p>
<p class="cnNiNjRmZGM5YjM2NjQ3YjNiODYzZDlkNTUxYmFlNWQx"><span style="font-weight: 400">He froze, straining his ears; the initial entry was typically the loudest part of any infiltration, in his experience. Had he woken anyone? He waited, his heart pounding like it always did in these moments of uncertainty. After a full minute passed with no sounds, no footsteps, not even an unexpected snore, Terrance slowly relaxed. Good. Step one: complete. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkZmQyMWY2NTA1ZDRhNjVhZDM0ODk5ZTA5YzJmZWQ5"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance breathed in deeply as he set to keep moving. The air smelt vaguely of typical cleaning solutions, which wasn’t unusual for noble homes like this one. Servants tended to do a quick touch-up just before bed to make sure everything was ready for morning. Even so, the scent prickled at Terrance’s nose a bit.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiODczYTFiMGQ0NTRjYzY4YTNhNjg0ZTE5MDEwZTg5"><span style="font-weight: 400">He moved slowly through the house, testing each step carefully for squeaky floorboards. There was always one or two, no matter the house. But he was light on his feet, and after only a few minutes, Terrance was able to open the front door and let his companions inside. “Servants on the third floor, Camlus on the fourth,” he said softly. “Let’s check for his office down here first. Step lightly - servants don’t tend to be heavy sleepers.” </span></p><span class="cjEyMzZlZGZlNDYxNDRiYmM4YTE0OWJjNTc1ZjE2ZjY0"><br/>If you come across this story on Amazon, it's taken without permission from the author. Report it.<br/></span>
<p class="cnMyZTQ0ZjQ3NGY3MTRmMWJhNjQ4ODQ4ZTZmODExNmY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">He received a pair of solemn nods, though Ernesto cast a wary glance at the stairs, and the three of them set to work, trailed by a fascinated ghost. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDcxMzM0MGNlZTQ5YjRhOTUyMzRmMjU0YzNiMmNj"><span style="font-weight: 400">It didn’t take long to determine that Camlus’s office was not on the first floor. A large sitting room for guests, a kitchen, a dining area… but no office. “Next floor,” Terrance determined. “Don’t walk on the center of each step. Plant your feet slowly on the outside of it to prevent creaking.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzZjMyMmQwMjk4YTQwZDJiMDQzMDU1NDMwYmM5NjRi"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto inhaled slowly and nodded determinedly. Maeryn flashed a thumbs up, and they quickly ascended the stairs. When they were near the top, Ernesto accidentally put his foot a little too close to the center of one step, and it let out a loud creak. Ernesto’s face turned pasty white as all three of them froze, listening to see if their blunder had been caught. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyMDFlMTAxNTU1ZjQ5MDg4OTUxMmQyZGU1ZGRlODZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">After a minute, they slowly relaxed, and Ernesto wiped sweat from his brow. “Sorry,” he muttered. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyMjMzZTc0MzlkOTQ4ZmZhYzlkNjRlODg3YmFiYWEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance let out his breath slowly. “You’re doing well for someone with no practice,” he grudgingly admitted. “Just try to be more careful.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2M2VmZjY2NzY1ODQ4NTg4YjRiYjJjMDY3MjkyNTZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMxZDA0YTAxODk3YjQ0NDI5YTA3ZGY1ZTJmYjcxMDMw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance pretended not to notice the approving look from Maeryn as he turned away. Of course he wasn’t going to overly criticize Ernesto. It had taken Terrance himself weeks of practice as a kid to be able to step lightly in a house, and he’d had the benefit of teachers. Terrance was many things, but he tried very hard not to be a hypocrite. </span></p>
<p class="cnM4NjYyMWI3ZDljMjQ1MjhhNTc5MTNjN2NkNDYyN2Ri"><span style="font-weight: 400">That said, if they needed to go up to the third floor, Ernesto was going to have to stay behind. They couldn’t risk another sound like that. </span></p>
<p class="cnMyNzA1Mzg3NTJmMDQxNjE4NzNmM2ZiOTExMGI4ZjJm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Thankfully, they didn’t need to. “Over here,” Maeryn hissed, gesturing her companions towards a sturdy-looking door. “It’s locked. Think it’s the study.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5ODEyZjMzZDFkNTQ3NmY5N2EzNTIyOGI5NmY4Mjll"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance mentally mapped its placement against the outside of the house, and nodded briskly. “Probably, yes. One moment, I’ll pick the lock.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM2NGU2ZDkxYTRjNjQ0OTg4M2Y1YWQxMzBiNjZmZjU1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Reaching into a pouch he kept on his felt, he quickly retrieved his lockpicking tools. The lock was incredibly simple; he had it open in moments with a tiny, almost inaudible click. Terrance shook his head. “I probably could have picked this one with a butterknife,” he muttered as he slowly opened the door. </span></p>
<p class="cnNjM2ZiNGY3Y2RiZDRiMjE5MmMyZTEyOGRiZDQ1YzVj"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was dark inside, without a window to give natural light to the place. Replacing his lockpicking tools in his pouch, Terrance withdrew his Light Marble and gave it the tiniest bit of mana, allowing it to illuminate his surroundings. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmOTM3ZTg4MzQxNzRjZWNhODA0MmZiNDgxNGFhOWFl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Sure enough, it was the study. Terrance ushered his companions inside and closed the door behind them, locking it from the inside. Better to be careful, just in case a servant did wake up for whatever reason. </span></p>
<p class="cnMwYmIwZTMwMjcxYTQzZjQ4NDdjNzg1OTJlODNjMGIw"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, people. Get searching. Try not to disturb anything too much, and be sure to put anything back where you found it. No traces. Parlor, keep an eye for any bits of your handwriting.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmMWZlZDBhZTIyNDQ3YjlhNmMxY2Y4NGRhYjE3MzFm"><span style="font-weight: 400">They got to work, splitting up. Terrance took one set of desk drawers, Maeryn another. Ernesto began rifling through a filing cabinet sitting against the wall, and Parlor… hovered between them, quickly verifying any document they brought to his attention. </span></p>
<p class="cnNhMWRkNTlkOWE0MjQ2YTFiZjE3ZTNhNTMzY2FlNjY3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto’s hands trembled slightly as he flipped through one of the folders he’d extracted from the cabinet, his eyes widening. “Guys? Think I found something,” he whispered, his voice barely audible over the thudding of his heart.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMDM2YzVlMDc3YjRlNTZhODU1YzMxZWYwZjU3ODZi"><span style="font-weight: 400">“One of Parlor’s letters?” Maeryn questioned, glancing over at him.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNDc4ZjM2NWM0MjRhMTRhZjMyYWYwMWJmODgzMWJi"><span style="font-weight: 400">The necromancer shook his head negatively. “No. But… I think we found C. The initial from that alchemy log we took from the Airspire facility. The one providing reagents for them to create Mist bombs?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM1MDY3MTE2YzMzOTQ5ZTViMDdlZGM0NmViZjA0ZmVj"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?!” Terrance hissed, almost too loud, as he whirled on the two of them. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxY2JkYzlkNGM3NzRiYjc4NGVmYzkxNDNmZDJlN2Nl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto offered the papers to the rogue, who quickly read them even as the necromancer summarized it. “The filing cabinet had a lot of financial transactions, but there was a folder that didn’t belong… and I recognized the reagents. They’re the same ones we found in the facility.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNlMDllMjM5Yzk1NzQ2ZDViMmE0NGI5MmIyNDNmNTk1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“But that would suggest… that Charles Camlus was working with the ZRC, knowing they were experimenting on the Undead?” Parlor looked simultaneously devastated and horrified. “I… we were on good terms, I thought. I counted him as a friend. There must be some mistake.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYTg0YjFlN2Q1NTRkOTRhYjZiYzEzMGMyN2Y4OTRl"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance hummed noncommittally. “Could be. But you have to admit, it’s suspicious. And you dying right after you met up with him for a business deal… Well, that’s an awful coincidence.” </span></p>
<p class="cnMzMWRjODA2NjRjYjQ2NmY4MmMxNWM1ZTliNmM3NWYz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Parlor’s spectral form visibly dimmed, lowering almost to the floor as he took on a stricken expression. “I… I dearly hope that’s all it is. A coincidence.” </span></p>
<p class="cnNmNmM4OWRjYWM1NzQwOWE5ZGU2MmEzOWRhMDlkYTYw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn stepped between them, looking first at Parlor, then at Terrance and Ernesto. “Focus, people,” she ordered firmly, despite a flicker of tension in her eyes. “Yes, what Ernesto found is important, and we need to hold onto it. But that’s not what we’re here for. Keep looking for samples of Parlor’s handwriting.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5NTkyMDg3M2VlOTRkMDk4ODY5ZDE2YzRkYjkxM2Iw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance gave a salute that he was vaguely surprised was only half-mocking. “Yes, Captain.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3ODU2MGQwMjAyMzRkMWVhZmYyMjk2MGU2MDQ2NmE2"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Captain,” Ernesto echoed, turning back towards the filing cabinet.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4Y2E1NDU1Y2I1NzRmZjQ5NWRlZDM5YmY2MzJhZTE4"><span style="font-weight: 400">They continued in relative silence, only the soft fluttering of paper breaking the quiet. They eventually moved on from the filing cabinet and desk, searching the bookshelves that appeared to be full of thick folders. These, thankfully, were labeled with what Parlor recognized as noble family names, so it didn’t take long to find the correct one. </span></p>
<p class="cnM2YTg2ZDg1ZDBmYzRhOTI5M2QwZDNjZDg5MjYxOTY0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Inside were exactly what they were looking for - copies of correspondence to and from the Parlor family. The latest letter from Samuel Parlor sat at the very top. Terrance scanned it, nodding decisively. “Perfect. But let me see…” He flipped through the papers, and then took two other letters from Samuel, replacing the latest letter back in the folder and putting it back in the bookshelf. “Just in case Camlus does a surface-level scan,” he explained shortly. “Let’s get out of here.” </span></p>
<p class="cnM0YTQ2OGIzNTUzZjQ5M2JiZDgzMTM3YzdmNTVkODMx"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance unlocked the door with a swift motion, but stiffened when he heard a noise coming from downstairs. A clear sound of creaking floorboards… one from the kitchen, it sounded like, and one near the stairs. “Blight!” he hissed. “We’ve got company. Follow me, out the window! Maeryn, you catch Ernesto!” </span></p>
<p class="cnNhMmY4ZDRmMmY3ZTQxNGQ4MGYyZTMxOTkxNTM3NmEz"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?” Ernesto asked fearfully, but followed the rogue anyway. </span></p>
<p class="cnM1MWQ0OGYwOWZiZjRlYjI5OTExZDZlMmQ4MjY0Mjg3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrance dashed lightly into the room he’d come in through and pushed the window open. Maeryn didn’t hesitate, throwing herself through it and rolling as she hit the ground to bleed off momentum. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmMjc5NDg1OWYwZDRlNjU4OWYzY2I4YzJiMjdjYmQz"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ernesto’s eyes were wide as he witnessed his leader’s acrobatics, and hesitated. But he swallowed, set himself, and tumbled out the window, a high-pitched whine of fear emerging from his throat as he did so. </span></p>
<p class="cnMxMjllMDEzNzhmNjQ2NzFhZjU5YTdhOGM3YjhkNzE3"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn caught him with a grunt, angling the momentum so they both stumbled but didn’t fall to the ground. “Thanks,” Ernesto panted, trying to catch his breath and calm his racing heart. </span></p>
<p class="cnNkNzVkNjkyYzdmZTQxODY4OTc3ZTVmZDBhM2RhZWVk"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No problem.” Maeryn’s eyes flicked towards the front door. It was closed, so she looked up towards the window; Terrance had just closed it and was leaping down with catlike grace, falling onto all fours quietly before rising once more. Then Maeryn saw a figure in the window, and her face went ashen. “Depths and damnation…! Terrance! Undead at the window!” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyNWE4Nzk3MzcxNzRmOTQ4YjcyNjdlYjQ0NDI1NGE1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?!” Terrance looked up, then took a step back away from the house in reflexive fear. “Blighted Night! Maeryn, what’re we doing? Go in and fight, or run?!” </span></p>
<p class="cnNiMmE0ZDRjNmIyMzQxZjA5NmEzYWM2MzRhMWRiYTEw"><span style="font-weight: 400">Maeryn swallowed, mind racing. “There were two sounds, right? Two people downstairs?” </span></p>
<p class="cnM3YmE2ZDk0ZGNiYzQyYzY5ZjJhYTc1NTdmNTIwMTc3"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes!” </span></p>
<p class="cnM5OWJkODhiMWNmNjQ3MWFhOWZiOGZlYjg0YzQ4Mjli"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then that’s an Undead… and there’s a necromancer inside controlling it.” Maeryn thought furiously, but no matter how she looked at it, they were at a severe disadvantage. They weren’t prepared… especially for a necromancer who could kill the unsuspecting sleepers inside and raise three more Undead midfight. They’d be overwhelmed, especially if the necromancer had an answer for Ernesto’s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Command Undead </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">spell. She bit her lip, and made her choice. “Run! We need to go, right now!” </span></p>
<p class="cnMyYTFjNmJlODYyYzQ2ODliNmU0ZjYwZjdmNDUxOTRh"><span style="font-weight: 400">Neither of her companions questioned her decision. “Come on, then!” Terrance started running, and Ernesto and Maeryn followed, hot on his heels, their footsteps pounding against the street as they fled. </span></p>
<p class="cnNmYzBmZjZiZmU4NjRiNjg5NGYyMjdmZTY4M2JmN2Q5"><span style="font-weight: 400">As they ran, Maeryn’s heart clenched with guilt. She hoped she hadn’t just condemned Charles Camlus to death via necromancer, but she had a sinking feeling that that particular prayer would go unanswered. </span></p>
