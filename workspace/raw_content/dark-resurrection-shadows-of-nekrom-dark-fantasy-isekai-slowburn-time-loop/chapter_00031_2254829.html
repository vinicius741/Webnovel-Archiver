<p class="cnNkZGI4NThhYjNmNTRkNGQ4MmQ1NGY0NDFlYjI3Mjg0"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">After burying Viktor in pristine ground, the small group made their way back to the Mercer-Archeos estate in just over two hours, having accomplished Severus's mission, albeit with a more than undesirable outcome.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiMTJmYmY4ZWQxMDRjZTM4NjVkNWI1Y2IyNmE0MmE4"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">In addition to the harsh bitterness of finding the mercenary dead in such a dreadful manner, Tristessa regretted not having had the opportunity to recover her photograph. Her only remaining connection to Earth that, perhaps, hadn't been destroyed along with her clothes after her first Death.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NzEyNDcxNTM3MjRlNjI4MGQ1ZWZjN2Y4Mjg1MGNh"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">It was difficult to let go and give up, knowing there was no way to get it back without inventing a series of lies to tell those two men and risking them discovering she wasn't a Nekrom native.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZGJkYmE4ZDdjZjRlNzI4YzllOGQ2YzI1ZTBkNDg2"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">And, in regards of Nekrom...</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNWZlZjg4MjM5MzRiYTJiN2FiNWQxNDQ5ZTJhZDUw"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">The girl had no more tears to shed, Severus had taken care of that. A necessary course of action, one that even Jin agreed with as he was incapable of having a heart cold enough to carry out the task.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzOGQ4NjUwZTAzNTRiMjFhZGI1NDJlN2VkYjVjNTM2"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">The moral of the elf's warning was to never let your guard down. Never. That was the basis of the Empire's collective unconscious, at war with the Shadow Queen and her minions.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2N2UwZDNhMWZhNzQ2MzliNjAwZTQwNzMwOWVkMmNl"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Otherwise... One could run the risk of ending up like poor Viktor. Death in that world was commonplace. That was the cruel reality.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYTM3OGI4NDI1MjQzZTc5ZjA5YWQzYmU3MDliNmYz"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“<em>Nekrom</em>...” she said within the dark vaults of her mind, as she looked out the guest room window. The peaceful plain ahead, distorted by upper terrain and hills hundreds of Earth meters ahead, stretched to the horizon, where the sun was beginning to set, and darkness began to dominate everything. Her Baptism in Ruins pulsated with a fleeting pang of pain, making her put a hand to her chest. “<em>I don't want to die again</em>...”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MmNmMmQ5NTZiOTQyZDY5NjMxMWVkN2IyYTNiOTM0"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">That was going to be her last night in that house. Just to please Jin, without being able to do much more to thank him for his endless help and solidarity, she was going to stay for dinner and sleep.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTFlYzc5YTg5ZDRkMTBiYWQxNTg5ZjIzMjgyMTUz"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">However, that last bit was going to be a problem now that a certain crimson-haired elf had taken over the room's only bed: Severus was snoring, face up, fully clothed and without even removing his boots.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OTIyOTllMjYxYzRkNjE4ODczODkwOGRlZGMzZDdk"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">He looked so absurdly cute, sleeping like a drunkard, yet so brimming with unearthly beauty... Tristessa couldn't help but feel very nervous now that she was giving the elf her full, uninterrupted attention.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MmI1ZGYzYzczOTQ3MWFiNTIzYjQwZjE4ODE5NDlj"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Ahhh, damn it! Am I really that love-struck or what?!” she exclaimed, both hands on her head. Having failed to take advantage of the privacy her mind offered, her cry ended up waking the blood elf. “…Fuck. Sorry, Severus.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZTExMGE5Y2M4ZDRhNjRhOTI5ZTE1NDk3NTY4MDIx"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Wha…? Is it time to eat? For a decrepit crone, you look quite young today, Tiara...” The elf yawned and scratched his long right ear before realizing his mistake. “Oh, Miss Tristessa!”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNjM2Y2VmNDdmYjQ5ZjhhZmM2NzcwN2UyMTRmZTY4"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Are you suicidal or something? If you dare saying that to Miss Tiara... You're crazy,” the girl muttered, horrified. Severus burst out laughing and sat on the edge of the bed.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwYTk1NTk4ZmM4MjQ4Yjk4MDNmZjNjODNkZmUxZTli"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Yes, I admit today wasn't an ideal day to joke with her. Did you see her face when we arrived? She doesn't like me, but you... I don't need to ask her to know she hates you with all her heart.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMyYTU3Yjc0ZjVjZTQ4ZTQ5N2VhZmM0YTg0Mjc0MTk0"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Sighing, Tristessa nodded.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ZTFmYjUxNGI2NDQ5NWViM2FlMTJiZWEzMjBhMzU1"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“She have no love for me right from the start, but it just so happens that before I went with Jin to the woods, I had a rather heated verbal exchange with her,” she explained, sprawling back in her chair and ignoring the tickle in her neck she felt whenever Tiara was the focus of a conversation. An implicit resentment, directed at that person in particular. “Neither of us want to see each other’s faces.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ODc2NGUyNDU4NjQ5YjE5NDI3ZTMwMTdmMjY2MWE4"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Then be thankful that tomorrow at dawn you'll be on your way to Entrana, in the company of this handsome elf.” Severus, with a smug gesture, was proud of himself. “Jin looked so worried when he begged me on his knees to take you under my wing... What a melodramatic man.”</span></p><span class="cmFlNjFiOTJhZDY5YTQ2NmQ4MjE0YTE2OTQ2ZWYxYWE0"><br/>Enjoying this book? Seek out the original to ensure the author gets credit.<br/></span>
<p class="cnMxZWFlNmQyZDQ3NDQ4MmQ4MDZlNzgwN2ZhYmUwMDY5"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Is it all right for me to come with you?” she asked, shy. “Will I not be a burden to you?”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NzNiMmVmZGYxODQ1NDY5N2FjOWRlYzhmNzJlNWZi"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Of course not. I'll help you heal your mind, that's a promise. In return... I think you'll have to pay me by working as my assistant in my business.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM5YzBhNzVhMjQyYTQ5NWRhM2QyYjk4MzQzOGJlMDIy"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Yeah, I didn't think it would be free.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM4OGJmYTU1N2ViMTRhNDI5YjRhOWQ2YWIzZmU0MDdk"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“Nothing is. If that idea doesn't interest you, there are other ways to pay me…”</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYmQ4YTFlMGFjNzRkYWZhODNhNTY1NDQxOWViMmYy"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Tristessa's heart made a violent leap at that dangerous insinuation. When she opened and closed her mouth several times like a fish, the elf couldn't hold back his laughter.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYzdmYWMzMmE1MjQ5MTU5NGFhYWFjZWY1YWViMTM5"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“I was joking! You're too young and too human for me, miss. This elf only accepts women with long ears, red hair and in their fifties or older. If you know any, I'm available to do my part for the continuation of my species.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYzY4MDA4YTFjNTRmMDM5OWFiYjJhMzZmOGMwYzVh"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">The girl laughed, quite nervously.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhNTYwYWY3OTVjODQ1N2ZiZGE3ODEzM2UxZDc1NGIw"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“You scared me a bit there, Severus. But that last thing you said... I feel like you weren't joking around,” she said, her voice trailing off at the blood elf's silent confirmation.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyNmNjZDAwNzgwODRlYThiNDI2ZjMwN2ZhN2E4YmEy"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">An awkward silence. The atmosphere was ruined, and a smile faded to give way to an apathetic grimace that tainted Severus's natural appeal.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMDQ5NzEyZTJjMTQwZGI4MWVjYWRlMDNmYzA2OTFm"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“...of course, you don't remember: we elves were driven to the brink of extinction at the hands of the Shadow Queen.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3ZjAyYzZkNjQ2NTQ5MGQ4ZjIxODZkNGI3ZTczY2E1"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">There was no longer any fun and sympathetic quality in his voice. There was only legendary fury, eyes emanating icy bloodlust, and fists clenched with insane strength.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNzYwNTAwNzdiNjRjNmZhODQyNWQwYWJkNDE5ZTM5"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“We blood elves are the survivors of the genocide that claimed dozens of million lives in a single day. Generations of <em>Light Elves</em> perished to ensure our continued existence. A sea of ​​blood that witnessed our birth... Bathed in the blood and tears of our brothers and sisters, flooding our stolen lands, soaking into our skin, our hair... Into our souls, marked with an eternal oath.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NzBkNjk5ZWYxZTQ4YmFhYWI1MGZjYTA2MGViOTMw"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“O-oath?” the cowering girl repeated, and Severus stood up, unable to sit still for a single second with so much anger overwhelming him.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NjY3Mjg0MmNjNjQ4ZjVhMGYxNjQ5NDVmMGNmZGRl"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“An oath of vengeance. We are the embodiment of our ancestors’ wrath, the voice of those who can no longer scream, and the sword of those who can no longer fight. We are fueled by the fire of eternal hatred for the evil that mercilessly annihilated us.”</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMTQ4OGJjZGQ0MzRlOGZhYTZmZDM5Mzg4ZDE5Yjc5"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Severus opened his hands and showed her those glyphs etched beneath his skin like bruises, filled with violent, supernatural energy that she could feel altering the immediate surroundings in a rapid degree.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MDE5NzM5ODZlNTQ3NjI4NzJmZDk2MzMxMGE3OWNj"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“We will never have peace until we see the Dark Lady on her knees and be the hand of a blood elf the one that banishes her malevolent, depraved soul to oblivion.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM2ZTI0NjFkMTlmNjQzOGM4ZTJiODI4MzA2MThiNGI4"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">The sudden fear Tristessa felt couldn't be dissolved into nothingness, even though the elf had no hostile intentions toward her. She couldn't shake it off.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMmQyZjhiNDc2MDRjOTM5NTc4NGQxYmQ3MjEwMDcx"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Genocide. Extinction. Strong words that explained the inhuman fury Severus displayed when it came to the Dark Lady, or anything related to her, to perfection.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YzRiMThiNjBlOTQ3ODBiNmM4ZTYzNGE5MDViYmFk"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">She felt the blood elf's hands emanating the energy of those glyphs catalyzed by his soul, like a burning heat that reached her face, and only that kept her firmly in place. Away, shunned. Protected from being hurt if she tried to take another step.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMjg2M2Q5OGRkMjRlOWE4NDAwZDdmODRmMGRhNDY4"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“S-Severus...” She cleared her throat before continuing. “I suspect you need a hug, but all that anger you feel burns...literally. I'm feeling it from here.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOGU0NTMxNGE0NTQyYTY4NmU1ZWM4MGNlYTljN2E1"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">She couldn't get the elf to release any of the tension he was carrying, not even a small laugh.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiYTk3ZWE4Y2JiZjQ2YTM4MmNkZGRiZWJiZWI2YTgy"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“I hope it doesn't end up burning you, kid. However… I don't know why, but I sense that you know very well what it's like to feel this kind of anger.” The comment surprised Tristessa. He said it with serious confidence, clearly knowing what he was talking about. Severus clenched his fists and sat back down on the bed. “Something in your eyes tells me so. And to see it in a lady as young as you… It saddens me a little.”</span></p>
<p class="cnM0ODcyNGI3MTYwNTRiNzRiNzYxYWE1OGQyZTNjMzE5"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">Tristessa lowered her gaze a bit, unsure of what to say. She thought she couldn't possibly feel such violent and chaotic emotions, but… There was a precedent, one that happened that very day, in the dilapidated stable of that very house.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0MjJhZWM1NWVlNjRlOTI4OTMzOTJlY2JiODY4Nzcw"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">A precedent of unleashed emotions, which served as fuel for all that fury expressed in words that could define Tristessa Irandell as a cruel person.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDJkMDljMGQ4YjRiOTU5ZTRlYjJlNDM0MDNhMTc2"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva"><em>A piece of shit</em>, as her mother's voice told her in her shattered memories.</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZGExYWI0OGMwMzRkMmRhMGE2MWViY2ZhYTdiNDYy"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“I hope I’m wrong,” he heard the elf murmur.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNmZjNmFjMDNlNzRhZGZhZDZlYmU0NjM3NjgzOGFk"><span style="font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, geneva">“…me too.”</span></p>
