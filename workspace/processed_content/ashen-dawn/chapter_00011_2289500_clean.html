   The rocky outcropping provided the perfect vantage point. Dark clouds had gathered overhead since Argent's arrival an hour ago, the previously clear sky now transformed into a steadily darkening mass that rumbled with occasional thunder. A persistent drizzle had begun, gradually intensifying as twilight approached. Below them, the entrance to the abandoned mine was barely visible in the failing light, its weathered timber supports groaning softly in the strengthening wind. Two guards slouched by the entrance, rifles balanced carelessly across their laps, occasionally glancing upward at the rapidly changing weather with evident confusion and displeasure. Around the back of the main building, Argent could make out three more bandits gathered around a small fire that hissed and struggled against the increasing rainfall.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Beside her, Axel lounged against a boulder as if he were at a picnic rather than planning a heist, seemingly unbothered by the increasingly wet conditions. His crimson hair somehow remained vibrant despite the dimming light, water beading on it without dampening its fiery appearance. He popped a small red berry into his mouth and grinned.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You know," he said casually, wiping rainwater from his face, "when I suggested we check the weather before setting off, I didn't realize you'd be bringing it with you."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Argent tensed slightly. "I don't control it," she said, a defensive edge to her voice. "It just... follows me. Everywhere I go."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Hey, no complaints here." Axel spread his hands. "Makes for excellent cover. Very dramatic. Very you."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Five outside," Argent murmured, ignoring him, her indigo eyes scanning methodically. "Unknown number inside."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Piece of cake," he declared, crunching the berry loudly. "I count two more patrolling the perimeter. Poor bastards look bored out of their minds."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Argent nodded, having already noted the patrol. She hadn't mentioned them because she'd been tracking their route for the past twenty minutes, calculating the precise timing of their rounds. Detail-oriented by nature, she found Axel's casual confidence both irritating and strangely comforting.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Their leader will be inside," she said. "Probably with the component."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "With our luck, he's sleeping with it under his pillow." Axel's grin widened. "So, angel-face, what's the plan? Go in blazing or sneak and peek?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Argent shot him a withering look. "This isn't a game, demon."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Everything's a game if you're having fun," he replied with a wink. Then, seeing her expression, he sighed dramatically. "Fine, fine. Serious business. Got it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She turned her attention back to the mine complex. "The component is likely being kept in the main building. I can enter undetected while you create a distraction on the eastern perimeter."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Ooh, I love distractions." Axel rubbed his hands together. "How big are we talking? Minor commotion or full-scale chaos?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Nothing that will bring reinforcements," Argent cautioned. "Just enough to draw attention away from the main building."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You're no fun." He pouted momentarily before brightening. "But I can work with that. Give me three minutes after sundown, then make your move."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Argent hesitated, her eyes searching his face for any sign of deception. After their chance meeting in town and his unexpected offer to help retrieve the mining component, she still wasn't entirely sure why he was helping her. Demons didn't simply assist angels out of the goodness of their hearts - assuming they had hearts at all.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Why are you doing this?" she asked abruptly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Axel blinked, momentarily caught off guard by the direct question. Then he shrugged, a casual gesture that didn't quite match the sudden intensity in his eyes.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Told you. I'm bored." He flicked another berry into his mouth. "Besides, these yahoos aren't exactly good neighbors. Been shaking down travelers for weeks."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Argent didn't believe him - at least, not entirely - but she nodded anyway. Whatever his reasons, she needed his help. The town needed that component, and she couldn't retrieve it alone.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Three minutes after sundown," she confirmed.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Axel's smile returned, bright and dangerous. "It's a date."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <hr/>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Darkness fell swiftly over the mine. Argent crouched behind a pile of discarded ore, counting down the seconds. Her cloak was pulled tight around her slender frame, her bare feet silent against the rough ground. She could feel the cool night air against her skin, carrying with it the scent of pine and distant rain.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Right on schedule, a series of small explosions erupted from the eastern perimeter. Not loud enough to be alarming, but strange and persistent enough to draw attention. Shouts of confusion rose from the guards, followed by the sound of running footsteps as they moved to investigate.
  </span>
  <span>
   Argent didn't waste a moment. Closing her eyes, she concentrated, feeling her body begin to shift and disperse. Transforming into mist was never a comfortable experience, but it was effective. Where a moment before a young woman had crouched, now only a wisp of pale fog hovered, barely visible in the darkness.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She drifted toward the main building, sliding effortlessly through a crack in one of the weathered shutters. Inside, the air was stale and heavy with the smell of unwashed bodies and cheap liquor. A single lantern cast weak yellow light across a cluttered room. Maps and papers were scattered across a table, surrounded by empty bottles and the remains of a meal.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   No one was present. Perfect.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Argent reformed, her bare feet touching down silently on the wooden floorboards. She scanned the room quickly, looking for anything that might be the component. The town's mechanic had described it as 'about the size of a bread loaf, with gears and copper wiring.'
  </span>
  <span>
   Her gaze settled on a metal box tucked beneath the table. It was padlocked, which seemed promising; why lock up something unless it was important or valuable? She knelt down, examining the lock. It was a simple mechanism, nothing she couldn't handle.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Outside, Axel's distraction continued. She could hear confused shouting and what sounded like maniacal laughter. Despite herself, her lips twitched in the ghost of a smile. The demon certainly seemed to be enjoying his role.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The lock clicked open under her practiced, nimble fingers. Argent lifted the lid slowly and there it was, the missing component, nestled in a bed of dirty rags. Its brass and copper fittings gleamed dully in the lantern light.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Well now, what have we here?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Argent froze. The voice had come from behind her, gruff and amused. Slowly, she rose and turned to face a burly man standing in the doorway. His beard was thick and unkempt, his eyes narrowed with suspicion. A heavy revolver was pointed at her chest.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I don't believe that belongs to you, girlie," he said, gesturing with the gun. "Step away from it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Argent's mind raced through her options. She could try to shift to mist again, but she'd need a moment of concentration, a moment the gunman might not give her. She could rush him, but in the confined space, with a gun trained on her, that was risky.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The component belongs to the town," she said, her voice calm despite the danger. "You stole it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The man barked a laugh. "Possession's nine-tenths of the law out here. And right now, I'm the one with the gun."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Are you sure about that?" came a cheerful voice from behind him.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The bandit leader started to turn, but he wasn't fast enough. Axel appeared in a blur of movement, red hair flying as he knocked the gun from the man's hand. It clattered to the floor, sliding beneath the table.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You little shi-" The bandit's curse was cut short as Axel's fist connected with his jaw, sending him staggering backward.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Language," Axel admonished with a grin. "There's a lady present."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The bandit roared and charged, but Axel sidestepped nimbly, tripping him as he passed. The larger man crashed into the table, sending maps and bottles flying.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Get the component!" Axel called to Argent. "I've got this oaf."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Argent didn't need to be told twice. She snatched the device from its box, tucking it securely under her arm. As she turned toward the door, two more bandits appeared, drawn by the commotion.
  </span>
 </p>
 <span>
  <br/>
  Stolen from its rightful author, this tale is not meant to be on Amazon; report any sightings.
  <br/>
 </span>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Problem," she announced tersely.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Axel glanced over his shoulder, still grappling with the bandit leader. "Ah. The more the merrier."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The newcomers rushed in, one brandishing a knife, the other a length of chain. Argent met them head-on, ducking under the swing of the chain and delivering a precise strike to the wielder's solar plexus. He doubled over, gasping, and she used his momentum to flip him over her shoulder.
  </span>
  <span>
   The knife-wielder was more cautious, circling her warily. Argent balanced the component in one hand, watching for an opening. When he lunged, she twisted away, her free hand catching his wrist and forcing it upward. With a sharp twist, she disarmed him, the knife clattering to the floor.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A blast of heat suddenly filled the room as Axel unleashed a controlled burst of flame from his palm, forcing the bandit leader back. The man's beard was singed, his face reddened from the close call.
  </span>
  <span>
   "Next one won't miss," Axel warned, flames still dancing around his fingers.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The bandit leader glared, but fear had replaced the confidence in his eyes. "Take it then," he spat. "It's worthless anyway, couldn't figure out how to make it work."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That's because it's not meant for idiots," Axel replied cheerfully. He gestured to Argent. "Shall we?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Argent nodded, already backing toward the door, the component clutched protectively against her chest. Outside, she could hear more commotion; the rest of the bandits had apparently realized something was wrong.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Exit strategy?" she asked.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Axel winked. "I might have left a little surprise by their vehicles."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   On cue, a much larger explosion rocked the compound. Shouts of alarm rose from somewhere beyond the main building.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That'll keep them busy," Axel said with satisfaction. "Time to make our grand escape."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Together, they slipped out of the building. The bandits were scrambling toward a storage shed that was now engulfed in flames.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Without a word, Argent and Axel sprinted toward the tree line, the stolen component safely in hand.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <hr/>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The night had grown colder by the time they deemed it safe to slow their pace. The storm had followed their journey, spreading outward from their position in all directions. No moon or stars were visible through the thick blanket of clouds that had formed over miles of landscape. Lightning occasionally forked across the sky, illuminating their path in brief, stark flashes. Argent cradled the component in her arms, occasionally checking it for damage and wiping away the constant moisture.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "How long have you been doing this?" Axel asked suddenly, gesturing vaguely at the turbulent sky above them.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Changing the weather?" Argent shook water from her cloak. "It's not something I do. It's something I am. The Angel of Storms."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "And it happens everywhere?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She nodded grimly. "The longer I stay, the worse it gets. This is just the beginning. A few days in one place, and..." She trailed off, but the implication was clear.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That explains the wandering," Axel observed. "Can't exactly settle down when you bring monsoon season with you."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Argent allowed a small, bitter smile. "No. I can never stay anywhere long. Two weeks at most before the flooding begins. A month, and there would be landslides, lightning strikes, devastation." She looked up at the dark sky, her creation and her curse. "This town has already seen more rain in the past day than they typically get in a week, and it will only intensify until I leave."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That's why you're so determined to help them quickly," Axel realized. "You're racing against your own storm."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She nodded, saying nothing more on the subject. The sound of rain filled the silence between them as they continued their journey.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You know, for someone who can turn into actual mist, you sure do a lot of worrying," Axel observed, strolling alongside her with his hands in his pockets.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Argent frowned slightly. "This is important to the town. Without it, the mill can't function, and without the mill..."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "People suffer, livelihoods are lost, children go hungry, yeah, I get the picture." Axel rolled his eyes. "What I don't get is why an angel cares so much about a bunch of humans and their little problems."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Argent remained silent for a long moment. The question wasn't entirely unreasonable but the answer felt too personal to share, especially with a demon. Finally, she said, "Not all problems are little to those experiencing them."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Axel studied her curiously. "That's not really an answer."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I wasn't aware I owed you one," she replied evenly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He laughed, the sound bright and unexpected in the quiet forest. "Fair enough, angel-face." He stretched languorously, reminding Argent of a cat. "Still, we make a decent team, don't we? You with your mistiness and me with my natural charm and good looks."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Despite herself, Argent felt a smile tugging at her lips. "And arrogance," she added.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It's not arrogance if it's true," he countered with a wink.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   They walked in companionable silence for a while, the path gradually widening as they approached the main road. The town was still several hours away, but they'd be there before dawn.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I still don't understand why you helped," Argent said at last, her voice softer now. "What do you get out of this?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Axel shrugged, his expression suddenly unreadable. "Maybe I just wanted to see if you'd trust me enough to try."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Before she could respond, he bounded ahead, turning to walk backward so he could face her. "Race you to the crossroads!" he called, then took off running.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Argent shook her head, but there was a lightness in her chest that hadn't been there before. Still cradling the component carefully, she picked up her pace.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The town was beginning to stir when they arrived, the first hints of dawn barely visible through the heavy storm clouds that had gathered overnight. Streets had become muddy, and small streams formed along the gutters. The townsfolk moved quickly from building to building, many casting worried glances at the unnatural weather pattern that had descended so suddenly upon their community. A few early risers were already placing sandbags at doorways or reinforcing shutters against the strengthening wind.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Three days of this, and they'll have flooding," Argent murmured, more to herself than to Axel. "I need to make sure the component is installed and working, then leave before any real damage is done."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Looks like we're the talk of the town already," Axel noted, waving cheerfully at a startled woman who nearly dropped her basket at the sight of them. "Though they seem more concerned with your weather magic than with us."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The component is what matters," Argent reminded him, though privately she wondered what the townspeople made of their odd pairing, a barefoot woman in a tattered cloak and a red-haired man with too-bright eyes.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   They made their way to the mechanic's shop. Despite the early hour, smoke was already rising from the forge. Argent knocked firmly on the door.
  </span>
  <span>
   The mechanic, a grizzled older man with hands permanently stained with oil, opened it with a scowl that quickly transformed into astonishment.
  </span>
  <span>
   "You found it!" he exclaimed, his eyes wide as Argent presented the component. "By all that's holy, you actually found it!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It was nothing," Axel interjected with false modesty. "Just a little breaking and entering, some minor arson, the usual."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The mechanic seemed too overjoyed to register Axel's words. He took the component with reverent hands, examining it for damage before clutching it to his chest.
  </span>
  <span>
   "The town council will want to reward you," he said, already turning toward his workbench. "I can have the mill running by midday if I start now."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "We don't need-" Argent began, but Axel cut her off.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "A reward would be most welcome," he said smoothly. "Perhaps accommodations at the inn? We've had a long night."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The mechanic nodded absently, already engrossed in his work. "Yes, yes, I'll send word to the innkeeper. On the town's account, of course."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Before Argent could protest further, Axel had taken her by the elbow and was steering her back toward the door. "Pleasure doing business with you," he called over his shoulder.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Outside, Argent shook off his hand. "We don't need rewards," she said firmly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Speak for yourself, angel-face." Axel stretched again, this time with a yawn that showed off unnaturally sharp canines. "I, for one, am looking forward to a proper bed and maybe a hot bath. Even demons appreciate creature comforts."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Argent found she didn't have the energy to argue. The night's activities had taken more out of her than she'd realized, and the thought of rest was appealing. Besides, they'd accomplished their goal and the component was back where it belonged.
  </span>
  <span>
   "Fine," she conceded. "One night."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Axel's smile was triumphant. "I knew you'd see reason eventually."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The inn was a modest two-story building with a thatched roof and sturdy wooden shutters. Rain poured down the roof in sheets, creating a curtain of water around the building's perimeter. By the time they arrived, the innkeeper had indeed received word from the mechanic and welcomed them with a deferential bow, though his eyes betrayed concern at the unseasonable downpour that had accompanied their arrival.
  </span>
  <span>
   "Our finest rooms," he assured them, leading the way upstairs. "And meals whenever you wish them. The town owes you a great debt."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   They were shown to adjacent rooms, each with a narrow bed, a small table, and a window overlooking the town square. After the innkeeper departed, promising baths would be prepared shortly, Axel leaned against Argent's doorframe.
  </span>
  <span>
   "Not exactly luxury, but it beats sleeping rough," he observed.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Argent sat on the edge of the bed, suddenly overwhelmed by a wave of fatigue. "It's more than adequate."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Axel studied her for a moment, his expression softening slightly. "You should rest, angel-face. You look ready to drop."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She wanted to deny it, to maintain the facade of strength she'd cultivated for so long, but she couldn't summon the energy. Instead, she nodded. "Maybe just a quick nap."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I'll wake you for dinner," he promised, pushing off from the doorframe. "Dream of daring heists and devilishly handsome companions."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A small smile tugged at her lips despite her exhaustion. "Good night, Axel."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   He sketched a mock bow and disappeared down the hall, leaving Argent alone with her thoughts. She untied her cloak and laid it carefully over the back of the chair, then stretched out on the bed, her bare feet hanging off the edge. She'd thought sleep would claim her instantly, but her mind was still buzzing with the events of the night.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Axel continued to puzzle her. By all rights, they should be enemies. Angels and demons had been at odds since time immemorial. Yet here they were, working together, almost like... friends.
  </span>
  <span>
   The thought was disconcerting. Angels didn't befriend demons. They certainly didn't go on midnight heists with them or share rooms at inns. What would her superiors think if they knew?
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   But as sleep finally began to claim her, Argent found she didn't care what anyone else might think. For the first time in longer than she could remember, she'd felt alive - not just existing, but truly living. And if a demon had been the catalyst for that feeling, perhaps the universe was stranger than she'd been taught to believe.
  </span>
 </p>
