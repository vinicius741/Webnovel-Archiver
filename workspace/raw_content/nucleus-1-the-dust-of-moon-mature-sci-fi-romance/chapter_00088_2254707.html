<p class="cnNkMDkwZDQwMWM4OTQ5MDViYzkzMGQ2ZDQ4MDE3ODFk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The voice came from above, and with it, a presence that seemed to devour the starlight. Jabari looked up, his grip tightening on his Vibro-Spear as the massive form emerged from the shadows of an overhead gantry.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlY2MwMTc3MmYyNDQ2YWM4ZWFkODJhNTc2MGE3YTdk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dakai's bulk dwarfed them all, his chitinous armor gleaming wetly in the Gyata's green light. Blood – Seydou's blood – still dripped from his massive claws, each drop sizzling where it struck the platform. His skull-like head had a twisted mockery of a human face, features contorted into a cruel smile.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MWU1ZGQ0MjdlMTQ1NjlhMTY2MWIxNTQ4MWY0NDc3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Maridians," Dakai's voice dripped with dark satisfaction, mandibles flexing as he spoke. "Centuries ago, you were but slaves and playthings for those superior to you. To see your pathetic huts here on Osram disgusts me to no end."</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NmU3ZWIzZWFmZDQwOWQ4MWE1ZWQ1YjQ3MzRkOGYy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Watch your tongue, Radi-Mon," Jabari shot back, positioning himself between the monster and his wounded friend. His voice remained steady despite the dread creeping through his veins.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NjQ4OTVhOTE4MDQwYTA4MjQ2MTExZjAyYTE1ZmM4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dakai paused and laughed, the sound like rocks in a grinder. "I serve a far superior master than you do. Skarn has promised me my own Hundkyndas to breed with for annihilating your kind." His gaze shifted to Ume, mandibles clicking. "Though perhaps I'll start with your little Imperial toy there."</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Yjg1NmU4ZjFmMDQ1Mjg5OTIwYmI3OTM1YjJmM2Fj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"You'll find I don't die so easily," Jabari growled, muscles tensing for action. Behind him, he could hear Seydou's increasingly labored breathing.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YzllNjIyOTZiYzQ5OTY5YWY1YjY0Y2UzZjIxZjgz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Good," Dakai's eyes glowed brighter. A collection of dark, pulsating tendrils writhed along his back as he took another step forward. "I enjoy it more when they fight. But tell me, little Maridian – wouldn't you rather face me in that machine of yours? Show me what your Maridian engineering can do before I tear it apart?"</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MWZhODcyZDUxYTRhMzJhZjA3MDg2M2Q5Y2NlNTg1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari's jaw clenched, every instinct screaming at him to strike now, but Dakai's words carried a twisted logic. The Scarab stood behind them, their best chance at survival.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMDFlODEzY2Y5NzRmNTFiYjA0ZjQzOWNkZGJkYzll"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Isazi..." Seydou wheezed, blood bubbling at the corners of his mouth. "Ume needs to..."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxNDY0MGVhYjA1MjRmYWVhZWYyYjhiMTE3MzE3ZDFj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Ume," Jabari kept his eyes locked on Dakai, speaking with deliberate calm. "Get to the ship. Start the launch sequence."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzN2I0NDNiYTJhNDQyOGFhNTAxOWFkYWVhZjczMTVm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"But—"</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNjU2Y2U4NTQ1MTRhMjFhOWFiZTJkYTUyMDhkN2Zl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Go, Ume." There was no room for argument in his tone. "Honor his last request."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NmJjZGE0MzRmZjQ4MTk5YzI1YjEyZjJjMzgxNGE0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Ume hesitated only a moment before moving, mounting her Gyata. The hoverbike's wings flared with energy as it lifted away from the platform.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0NDkwYWRiZjEyZDRjNTliZjIzMjVhOTE2MjFkMzZi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Is that Imperial a maid of yours? Looks rather delicious," Dakai mocked, making no move to stop her.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZGUwOTZmOTE2MTQwYWRiNTU4ZTc5YzIxMTQyOTIy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari allowed himself a grim smile as he backed toward his mech. "You talk too much for someone about to face a Scarab at full power."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYjdjZGE3ZWY0MjQ3NDhiODdiMTFjZTQxZmZkNDhi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The monster's laughter echoed across the platform. "Then by all means, little Maridian. Show me what your toys can do."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlMzUxZmJmYjQ1YzQ3YTBhYmU3YzdkY2U2ODM2NzFi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari reached the Scarab's access ladder, never taking his eyes off Dakai. The creature made no move to attack, seemingly content to watch. Above them, the massive bulk of the Isazi loomed against the star-filled void, its green running lights pulsing like a distant heartbeat.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NTMzOTIyZTkzYjQ0MDE5YmFhZTMwNDIzNTYwNzlm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Scarab's cockpit sealed around him with a hiss of hydraulics. Systems came online as the neural interface connected, transforming the mech's bulk into an extension of his own body. Through the viewscreen, he could see Dakai still watching, still smiling.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwNjQ5YWRhMjc5MDQ5MmU4ZDdmN2IyNTIzZWExMTdh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"For Seydou," Jabari whispered as he brought the mech's weapons online. The Plasma Spitters hummed with building charge while the Sun Moon Cannon waited in reserve.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YjNlYTUyMDUxYjQxZGM5Y2U0ZTk5NDdjMmMwZTI4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">With a roar, Dakai lunged, his movements a terrifying blur, his massive claws extending, tendrils whipping through the void.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0YWUyY2FmMjgxMDQ4N2Y5NmQyZGY4MjA4Y2MyMmU3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Scarab's first strike came with thunderous force, its reinforced frontal limbs swinging in a devastating arc. Dakai twisted away with unnatural speed, his bulk belying a dancer's grace. The platform beneath them shuddered from the impact as the mech's attack struck empty air.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NDYyNzM2ZDQ3MjRmYjQ4YzJmODc3N2MwYTFjODRh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Too slow!" Dakai's claws raked across the Scarab's flank, sending sparks cascading into the void. The mech's armor held, but warning indicators flashed across Jabari's display.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YjRhOTBlM2JlMDQ5ZDNhMzdiZTE5MjQwMGE4MTBk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari pivoted the Scarab, all six legs working together. The Plasma Spitters opened fire, spraying a barrage. Dakai dove through the storm of energy bolts, his chitinous armor deflecting what few shots connected. The monster's laughter echoed through the comm system.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NDljMTkyYjZmOTQ0NzZiMGI1ZGFjNDQ4ODBkM2Ri"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Is this what passes for combat among your kind?" Dakai's tendrils whipped forward, wrapping around one of the Scarab's legs. "Let me show you true power!"</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMmYyNTQ2MmEwMTQ0YTRiNzQ4OTQ2NDAyNjUyZWRh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The mech lurched as Dakai heaved, nearly toppling it. Jabari compensated with the other legs, redistributing power to the stabilizers. The Scarab's systems whined under the strain.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZTU0YTg0NTBhNzQwZjhhNzEwZWJkZjk5OTFhOTA3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Then have at it!" Jabari growled, triggering the electromagnetic pulse in the trapped leg. The surge of energy forced Dakai to release his grip, giving the Scarab space to maneuver.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZWNiYWIwNzAzODRjMjk5MmE5MmNkMDBlMjhjMTA5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">He charged, every muscle ready. The frontal limbs of his Scarab met Dakai's brute strength, metal screeching as it parried blows that could shatter stone.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MzJiNDQwMjk1ZDQ0YmZiNWUzOGE2ZWFmNzg5ZWI1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Above them, the Isazi's engines began to rumble to life. Dakai glanced up at the sound, and Jabari seized the opening. The Scarab charged, slamming its full weight into the monster. They crashed together against a support column, the impact sending tremors through the entire platform.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZDM3NmExMzcwODQ2NDJhNTEwZTU4OWMwZmQ5MzY0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">For a moment, Jabari had him pinned. The Scarab's frontal limbs pressed Dakai against the twisted metal, hydraulics straining to maintain pressure. Through the viewscreen, he could see the monster's face up close – the unholy fusion of human and insect features, the eyes burning with ancient malice.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1ZjcxMzk1M2U2MzQyM2NiN2NiOWZkNDhlZGI0ZDJl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Ah, you fight better when enraged," Dakai's mandibles clicked in appreciation. "But still..." His claws suddenly plunged deep into the Scarab's shoulder joint, finding gaps in the armor. "Not good enough!"</span></p>
<p class="cnNjZjZhOWUzZTFjNTQwMzliYzNmMWY5ZDYwMzA1MDAw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Warning lights flared across Jabari's console as Dakai's claws tore through servo-motors and power conduits. The Scarab's right frontal limb went slack.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NjljNWNhMDc0MDQwYTlhY2FlOTNlNzdjMGI5YjM5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Systems failing," the mech's computer announced. "Right anterior actuator compromised."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZTFhOWI4NzJhMDRmNWNhNzExZWYxMmZhOTY0YzNl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"An A.I. assistant? Wasn't here before…" Jabari wrenched the controls, forcing the Scarab to disengage. The mech staggered back, compensating for its damaged limb. "I'll put that to good use."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYjc5ODUzNWY4ZjQzYzU5MTRkNWM0NjYxMGIyYjQz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dakai pursued, his bulk somehow fluid in the low gravity, tendrils writhing like hungry serpents.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyY2Y4ZTg3NTM5ZTQxOTdiMDhiMzk0MDIzMTAzOGE5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Your artisans did fine work," the monster taunted, gesturing toward Seydou's motionless form. "But in the end, all fail before the Hivemind's power."</span></p>
<p class="cnMwY2QwZGNjYzYzZDQ0NDg4Yzk0ZDQzNjJlOTNhNDZk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Scarab's remaining weapons came to life, Plasma Spitters tracking Dakai's movement. Green bolts of energy lit up the darkness, forcing the creature to dodge and weave. But each miss only seemed to fuel his amusement.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Y2JlZjYzZTMyNjQ2MzhhY2I5MTMzZTQ3MjJkMzA4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Sun Moon Cannon," Jabari muttered, knowing he'd get only one shot. The weapon would need at least three seconds to charge – an eternity in combat.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZGU2YjNjNDZkMjQwNDA5OTQyNmU0NzIxZmU3ZDAw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">As if reading his thoughts, Dakai surged forward. "No time for your toys!"</span></p>
<p class="cnNmYmE5MTZhNjZjYTRlNGJhMjQ0YWE2MjhhZDc3MjEx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Scarab met his charge with its remaining frontal limb, the impact resonating through the mech's frame. They grappled in the void, metal screaming against chitin, neither giving ground. Through the viewscreen, Jabari could see Dakai's face inches from the reinforced glass, mandibles clicking with anticipation.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMmFhMDk1MTNjMTQ3MzM5ZDRkNDJmZTUxMjUwZjJj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Above them, the Isazi's engines reached full power, its massive shadow dancing across the battlefield. The platform shuddered with sympathetic vibration.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlOWI5OTVhNWVjZDQ2NDQ5MTJhYTQxMzdmZDhjNDE1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Your ship awakens?" Dakai's voice carried an edge of satisfaction. "Good. Let them watch as I tear you apart, piece by piece."</span></p><span class="cjU5YmU5NGZmMDQ0NjRiYmNiNTkyZjBhNzQ5NWRjNDZl"><br/>The story has been stolen; if detected on Amazon, report the violation.<br/></span>
<p class="cnMyMTI1NGZiNjVkOTQzYjlhYWY5YjFhYzJhNmY4ZDA5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The monster's claws found another weak point, this time in the Scarab's leg joint. Warning alarms blared as the mech's stability systems began to fail.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2YjhhNDc5MmRmNTQwNTNhYjc5NGMwNTUxNDk5N2Ew"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">But in that moment, Jabari saw his opening.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzYmQ1YWM2NDk3NjQxY2ZhZGIyMTkyYjk2NWZhOGFk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Emergency power to forward stabilizers!" Jabari declared. The Scarab lurched, its weight suddenly shifting forward. The unexpected motion caught Dakai mid-strike, forcing him to release his grip to maintain balance.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZjE4MTIyYjE4YjQ5ZDNhZjE3MWFiZGQ0MmNiNDEy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Three seconds. That's all he needed.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNTBlYjI5NjI5MTQ5MzE4NDY3YTE3ZTM1OTk1NmNk"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Shell release initiated," the computer announced as the Scarab's back began to split open, revealing the Sun Moon Cannon's barrel. Energy built with a rising whine that cut through the battle's chaos.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhOTdmMjI5ZjU0MTRmYjFhNWNiOGIwZjgwODc4MzUw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dakai's eyes widened in recognition. "No —"</span></p>
<p class="cnNjY2Y4Mzg2MjY0YjQ4MTM4MDI3M2Y5YjMwZTk0ODYw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Two seconds.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3YmI4NGE0ZDBmZDQ5MTNhZTY3YWNlMzZjMTk4MTNm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The monster lunged forward, claws extended, but the Scarab's remaining limb caught him across the midsection. The blow wasn't enough to stop him, but it slowed his advance.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0N2M5MTBjMWEwNTQzNGRiOTBkOGNlZmY5NGZjMDE0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">One second.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjNzI3MDFhNWQ2NTQ0NDk5ODAwNWJkMjQ5MzY4ZGMz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Die!" Dakai's tendrils whipped toward the cannon, trying to disrupt its charging sequence.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MGM4NmE2ZjY1NzRlMDBhODU1MTBlZTE1NDljZmQ5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Firing." The computer intoned.</span></p>
<p class="cnMwODFmNTQzMjBmNjRiZjk5ZTc0YmYwNmFlYzUzZWRi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Sun Moon Cannon's discharge lit up the lunar night, a concentrated golden beam of pure destruction that caught Dakai point-blank. The monster's scream of rage turned to one of pain as the energy engulfed him, his chitinous armor glowing white-hot where the beam struck.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmMjhhOTkxZGQxNzRlZTY4NDc3NzIzMGY1OWQ5NDFi"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The recoil sent the damaged Scarab stumbling backward. Through the afterglow, Jabari saw Dakai's smoking form crash into a collection of support struts, his armor blackened and cracking.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4Nzc3YjEyODQ1MjRkODI5MTgwM2U0NTZmNmYxYjBj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">But the monster was still moving.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Y2Y4ZjhkMTE1YzRhNDM4MDVlOGQxZjlkZWYxYmMy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Impossible," Jabari breathed. The Sun Moon Cannon's barrel glowed cherry-red, heat warnings flashing across his display. No second shot would come.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxYmMzMTc1OTE2YzQ4YWE4Mzc1ZmU5MDU3MjllYjdm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dakai rose, his movements jerky but gaining fluidity with each passing second. Parts of his armor had been burned away, revealing pulsing flesh that was already beginning to heal. His laugh, when it came, carried equal parts pain and cruel delight.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNWM4YTEyNmU4ZjQ2NzRiMDM5MWE5NzdkYzBjNjU0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"An admirable attempt," he snarled, advancing once more. "But I am a Draug personally blessed by the Primarch himself!"</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMzUwNjUxOGE4MDRjMTk5MzFjN2EzZTU4YTRkODg3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The platform beneath them shuddered violently. Not from their battle, but from something else. Something planned.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZmQxNzZlM2QwMTRkNmQ5NmYzYmU0MDkxYzMyMjY3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"All systems locked, everyone!" Ume's voice cut through the comm, calm and precise. "Platform anchor points disengaging in three... two... one..."</span></p>
<p class="cnM4MWRjYThmMWVmYzRkMmNhYzI4ZmI0MDIwNzc0YTgw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The entire section of platform groaned, metal screaming as pre-planted charges detonated along its support structures. The surface beneath them began to tilt, debris sliding toward the crater's depths.</span></p>
<p class="cnM0OWU3MTg0ZDY5OTQwOWJiYWRlOTJmNzM2ZTk0Y2Mz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dakai's bulk shifted, his claws scrabbling for purchase on the increasingly steep incline. "Clever pets," he growled, eyes burning with hatred. "But if I fall, you —"</span></p>
<p class="cnNhMWYxMmQzZDY2YTRmNDZhNDBiNGRmNDRmNTJiNzk0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">A green plasma bolt struck him from above. The Anioma fighter jet swooped past, Wilhelm's precise shot forcing the monster back another step.</span></p>
<p class="cnNiOGY0ZTI5NjRiMDQyNzhiMDhjNDhhMjFiYTMxYzMy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Jabari!" he called out. "The Isazi won't wait forever. Get up there!"</span></p>
<p class="cnMxODViZGFhNTViMjQ0ZjJhNjQ0OTFjNTM1MmQ5ZDUz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Scarab's systems flashed more warnings – structural integrity failing, power reserves critical. But its legs still responded. Jabari fought the controls, guiding the mech toward where Seydou lay motionless. The platform's angle grew steeper with each passing second.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNmVlODdiMDljMTRhMjc4ZTRiNTlmZGNiZWFmODM5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Primarch demands..." Dakai began, but another barrage from Wilhelm's Anioma kept him off balance.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MzQ1MWJjYzViZjQ1ZmI4MmQ0YTBmNzUxYTY1NTVh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari reached Seydou's body, the Scarab's remaining functional limb moving with desperate gentleness despite the chaos. As he secured his friend's form, his hand found something else – Seydou's cracked sunglasses, their tech-enhanced surface still holding a faint gleam.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2NzY1ODJlMDM3YTQ2MTliM2Q5YzhlOTczOGJmYzVh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Above them, the Isazi's true scale became apparent. The massive ship hung in the void like a mechanical leviathan, its green running lights pulsing in steady rhythm. The cargo bay doors gaped wide, promising sanctuary.</span></p>
<p class="cnM2MTIxNTgzOGI3ZDQxNTk5ZDEyZTU5ZmQwYThmNzVh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"End of the line, Draug!" Jabari called out, storing both Seydou and the sunglasses securely in the Scarab's cockpit. The platform had nearly reached a forty-five-degree angle now, loose equipment tumbling into the abyss.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3MWRkMDYwMDQ3NzQ0NjhiYzc3MWNiNjQ5YjRhYzQy"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Dakai roared in frustration as more of Wilhelm's shots forced him to retreat. "This isn't over, little Maridian!"</span></p>
<p class="cnNkYWNmM2UzZmRhMTQ1MDVhNzNkZTIwMzI1Y2U5M2U3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Scarab's jump jets fired, lifting the damaged mech toward the Isazi's waiting bay. Behind them, Dakai's powerful legs tensed as he leapt, his massive clawed hand missing Jabari's mech by inches. The monster's roar of frustration echoed across the crater as the platform collapsed beneath him, sending him tumbling into darkness.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMTBlMTc5NmU2MTRmMDBhM2Y3NGNkOTBlMmM3NDEz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">But even as Jabari cleared the bay doors, he saw Dakai clawing his way back up the crater wall, his eyes burning with hatred and promise. This wasn't over.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3Y2EyNGJhNzdkODRhNjA4MDhjNzZlOWFkZTU0NmZj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Scarab landed hard in the Isazi's cargo bay, its damaged legs buckling under the impact. Warning lights flashed across the console as multiple systems failed simultaneously. Through the viewscreen, Jabari watched the Anioma jet glide in just as the first Bone Fiends reached the edge of the launching pad, their claws scraping at the ship's hull.</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMGJjODFhMGE4YjQxNWZiZjM5ZDE3OGM2NGU3MTNh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Seal the bay!" Laurent shouted. "They're climbing up!"</span></p>
<p class="cnM5MmMwNWQ2MjFiNDQ4Yjg4NTY0ZDJhNjcyOGU4YTUx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The cargo bay doors groaned shut, the reinforced metal denting inward as something massive slammed against it from outside. Once, twice - then silence. The impact resonated through the massive space like a death knell.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZDdkZGRmZDYyNTRkMGU5ZThkODg5N2MzYmQ2YmVm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Only then did Jabari allow himself to release the controls, his hands shaking uncontrollably as the adrenaline crash hit him.</span></p>
<p class="cnNhZWE3NDIwMzU1NjQ5MGY5ODAzNmZlYzQxOGM1YzBl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Seydou's body lay still beside him in the cramped cockpit, the quartermaster's final expression peaceful despite everything. The cracked sunglasses in Jabari's hand caught the bay's green lighting, a last reflection of their owner's innovative spirit.</span></p>
<p class="cnM1NzNjMjQzMGU2YzQ1OTc5OTMwODZiYjFiZjMzNGVj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Scarab's hatch opened to voices – Laurent and Celine were already there. The prince's royal garments showed signs of combat, while the doctor's emerald robes bore dark stains from tending the wounded. Wilhelm stood slightly apart, his sniper rifle slung across his back, platinum hair disheveled from battle.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4Njg1ZjgzNTNmNTQxZjg5ZTc4MWEyMzE1YWFiZDg4"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Jabari descended the Scarab's access ladder on unsteady legs. Behind him, through the bay's viewport, the scene below stole his breath. Radi-Mons poured over Zeeman Crater's rim in endless waves, their forms blotting out the stars.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4NTA2NDc1ZDA5NTQyNGNhYmMzOWZmZmVlYzZmMDky"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Where Outpost Tumi had stood, now only ruins remained, swarming with creatures that seemed to multiply with each passing moment. The sight made one thing crystal clear – no amount of valor or firepower could have held that position.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyZDdkNzllYTc2MzRhNmY4MDAwZmU5OWMzOGE1NzU2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The situation grows dire below," Wilhelm observed from the viewport, his ice-blue eyes reflecting the carnage. "We should put some distance between us and this nightmare."</span></p>
<p class="cnM5NWVhNTczN2ExNDRmNzhiMDYyMzljNDlhYzc0MDcx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Jabari," Celine's voice drew him back, gentle but urgent. "Let me see to him."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZTMyN2I5Y2I0ODRkNGU4ZmQ0Zjc2YjM5ZGJkNjdm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">He nodded, unable to find words as they carefully retrieved Seydou's body. Laurent stepped forward to help, his usual regal bearing tempered by solemnity as he conjured a clean blanket, on which Jabari and Wilhelm placed Seydou, his arms crossed on his chest.</span></p>
<p class="cnMxMjU4YTQyNzk4MTQyYzRiNjkyZTM1ZmQ5NGVlODk0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Celine fell into step beside Jabari. "I should have been there," she said softly. "Perhaps if I'd reached Seydou sooner..."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkODRiMzc0YjZiZjRmNDlhNjNiMDU2NDg4ZmYyMDE5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Madam," Jabari's voice was gentle but firm. "Seydou made his choice. He saved those Moon Yams, gave Ume the knowledge she needed. Even at the end, he was thinking of our future."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMGY1ZjhhNGU3YzRkNmE5NmFiODg0NTg2ZTAxOTQ5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Moondust Crystal's shard, however," the prince began, but something in Jabari's expression made him pause.</span></p>
<p class="cnM3NjMwNGZkMWZiNzRhNTRhMTg1OTFkOGEyNGQ5MTJj"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Sir," Jabari's voice was rough. "It was my decision to let Skarn take it. I did not consider…" He straightened, meeting Laurent's gaze directly. "I stand by what I did. If that means punishment, I gladly accept."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkMTIwN2MxOTlkYTQyMTRhMTYzMDM2NTU4NmUwYmQ5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"There will be time for such discussions," Laurent raised a hand, his tone softening. "Right now, we honor the fallen and see to the living."</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZjYwOTRmYmI5NDQ1YzFhYzkyMzQ1YTAyNDdhOWMz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">They reached the bridge – a vast chamber dominated by holographic displays and control stations. Through the main viewport, Sun hung like a jewel against the void, a reminder of everything they fought to protect.</span></p>
<p class="cnM5Yjk0YjY0ZDQ5MDRhMzJhMWFlYjA4NjRlNTlkYTc1"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Still as clean as the day I joined," Wilhelm mused, watching Ume work. "Seydou always kept her in perfect condition."</span></p>
<p class="cnNlZDdkZTVlOGUxYTQ1MjdiMjM1NDgyNjZiYjdhZjZl"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Ume," Laurent turned to where the android stood, Seydou's manual clutched against her combat suit. "Seydou entrusted you with the Isazi's systems. Can you pilot us out of here?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMwOTExZGJhNGNkNTQyZjBiYmFlZGE5ODI2NjI1NTcw"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">She nodded, those distinctive yellow diagnostic lines threading through her irises. "Yes. I've already interfaced with the main controls. The ship's fusion core is at optimal capacity."</span></p>
<p class="cnMzMTEyNzM1NmM5NDQzNDNhMDdiY2YxNTM3YzYxZjk3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Then the bridge is yours," Laurent gestured toward the corridor. "Take us to Ndovu Zenith."</span></p>
<p class="cnMxZWI4Y2E3MTU2NTRlMTJhZGMyMzEzNzI1ZGY5OGIx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Putting Seydou's manual on a small desk beside her, Ume took the pilot's seat, her fingers flying across the controls as she began the launch sequence. The massive ship hummed around them, power building in its engines.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmZTMwODExNzNhYzQxMjc5MDEwOGRiMTBkZTRlNDFm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Alright…Ndovu Zenith," Ume echoed, her voice hesitant as golden lines flickered in her eyes. "Umm — is it in the African continent on Earth or another planet?"</span></p>
<p class="cnMwZTVlZDBkNDdjMTQ3ZThhNGViMDIzMjJiYjAyODE3"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"It's on Osram's Near Side, in Mare Nubium." Jabari reminded with a smile. "My people's bastion. Oldest human city beyond Earth."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjOTZkNjliODU1MDRkM2Y5MWI5NmIzMWJiMWEzZDk5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Thank you. Inputting," Ume faced the console, the flickering lights casting shadows over her face. Jabari stood by her side, watching.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlNjQ1NzNjYTZhNDRlNjBiYTM2NTU4MzhjZDg0YWYx"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Isazi, engage preflight checks and auto-pilot mode," she commanded, her voice weaving a surprising familiarity. The console blinked back at her in response. With a quick flip, she activated the ship's internal navigation system.</span></p>
<p class="cnNmNzRkYWM5MzA1YTQ2NmJhZmUyM2VhNzE5ODE2YTJm"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">Laurent nodded approval, but his expression remained troubled. "Chairman Kofi will want answers about the Crystal. We should invite him to meet us in Ndovu."</span></p>
<p class="cnNkZDQzYmFjOWYwMjQ2MmU5NmVjMWNlNDE2MjdkMWM0"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"The Sand Lotus will want to know, too." Jabari said solemnly. He wondered how Fuuka would react.</span></p>
<p class="cnNlYjI5ZDBmNmYyMTRkNzA4ZDA0NjY0Mzg4NTkzOTkz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"But first, we give Seydou and the other warriors a proper funeral." Celine's hand found his shoulder, offering silent support. "They deserve that much."</span></p>
<p class="cnNjMTEzNjQwODQwOTQ1M2U5NTljY2RmNjkzOTNjZmVh"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">The Isazi's engines reached full power, their deep resonance thrumming through the deck plates. Outside, Zeeman Crater and its horrors began to fall away beneath them, growing smaller with each passing moment.</span></p>
<p class="cnM4YmI3YzBjNzRjNzQ3ZDJhZDRiYThhYTdjNWI5MTIz"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva">"Course plotted to Ndovu Zenith, Mare Nubium," Ume announced from the pilot's seat. The ship's systems responded to her commands as if they'd known her touch for years rather than minutes. "At current speed, we have an estimated arrival: five hours and thirteen minutes."</span></p>
