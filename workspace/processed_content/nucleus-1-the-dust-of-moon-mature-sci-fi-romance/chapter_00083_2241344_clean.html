   The Serpent's Gaze, Shūn-Huáng (勳煌), an Imperium Dragonfort battlecruiser
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur's heels clicked against the polished obsidian floor as she entered the Serpent's Gaze, a chamber named for the dragon-like mosaic of gold and crimson on the ceiling. Before fully entering, she paused to take out Thomas's severed bionic finger from her pocket.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Lieutenant," she called to an officer following her, "have this secured in the artifact containment unit in my quarters."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The officer bowed stiffly, taking the bionic digit with visible discomfort.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "A trophy, Prefect?" came a voice from behind.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur turned to find Kaori Ouyang approaching in a deep crimson and black ballistic silk kimono with subtle golden patterns. Her olive skin contrasted with her jet-black hair, styled in an elegant updo with ornate pins. Most striking were her amber eyes—common among Martian Imperials—lined with red shadow that emphasized their catlike shape.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Something more valuable than a mere trophy," Dilinur replied, watching the lieutenant hurry away with his unusual cargo.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaori's painted lips curved into a smile, her ruby earrings swaying as she tilted her head. "A finger? How delightfully macabre." She stepped closer, lowering her voice. "I didn't realize you had such... interesting tastes, Prefect."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It's not what you think," Dilinur said, not hiding her smirk. "That bionic appendage contains unique identifiers, neural interfaces, and DNA traces from Mendoza himself."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Ah," Kaori's expression shifted to understanding. "A leash to pull our lost dog back to heel someday?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Perhaps." Dilinur gestured toward the Crystal chamber. "Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to report to Governor Qin."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaori's features showed subtle concern. "I hope it goes well."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The unexpected warning caught Dilinur off guard. "I can handle him," she said, more confidently than she felt.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   With a graceful bow that sent her earrings swinging, Kaori departed, her kimono rustling as she walked away, leaving Dilinur alone as she entered the Serpent's Gaze. Dragon motifs in gold leaf climbed the crimson walls, their eyes set with amber stones that seemed to glow in the dim lighting.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Behind her, the damaged Moondust Crystal loomed, its once-pristine surface now marred and fractured. Dilinur felt uneasy as she positioned herself before it.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Initiate connection," she commanded, her voice steady despite her nervousness.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The air shimmered, and two holographic forms appeared. Shao, Governor of Taiwan, appeared first, his long, embroidered robes of crimson and black rippling as his form solidified. His bald head gave him an intimidating look, and the scales of his dragon-crested robes seemed to shift with his movements.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Beside him, Shazmeen materialized, her dark skin contrasting with the golden threads in her robes. The Secretary of Province carried herself with reserved grace, her long, black hair falling in braids down her back. Her amber eyes, sharp and calculating, glowed faintly, assessing everything in the chamber. The black bindi between her brows caught the light as she looked at the Crystal.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "What is the meaning of this?" Shao hissed, his robes rippling with impatience.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur swallowed hard, fighting the urge to cower. "Honored Governor Qin, esteemed Secretary Shazmeen," she began, bowing deeply. "I present to you the Moondust Crystal, as promised."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Shazmeen remained silent, her eyes fixed on the Crystal as she stepped forward. Energy shimmered around her fingers as she reached toward the hologram, diagnostic runes briefly appearing in the air.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It is... fractured," Shazmeen finally said, her voice calm but disapproving. She continued examining the relic, the golden energy tracing along the cracks in the Crystal. "The damage is extensive, Governor."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Shao's hologram surged forward, his face angry. "You dare call this broken thing our prize? You have failed us, Dilinur!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Shazmeen remained silent, her expression blank as she watched. Dilinur felt sweat trickle down her spine.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "My lord," she said, struggling to keep her voice even, "despite its damage, the Crystal retains significant power. Allow me to demonstrate." She turned to the artifact. "Moondust, greet our esteemed guests."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   For a moment, nothing happened. Then, a chorus of hums filled the chamber, sending shivers down Dilinur's spine.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She wished the ancient stone would say something human. But the fading hum only made her heart sink further.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Shao's rage seemed to falter, replaced by a calculating look. Shazmeen's brow arched slightly—the only hint of her interest.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur's mind raced. She had bought herself a moment, but knew it wouldn't last. Her fingers tightened around her Psi Fan, drawing strength from its familiar weight.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Do you…do you see?" she pressed, trying to sound confident. "With Moondust's power, we can reshape reality. The possibilities are endless."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Shao's hologram flickered, his anger causing distortions. "Possibilities mean nothing if the artifact is compromised," he snarled. "You were tasked with retrieving it intact, Dilinur. Your failure will not go unpunished."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur's chest tightened, her breath catching. She could feel the weight of Shao's threat. Her mind flashed to past "punishments"—degrading acts performed for advancement. Never again, she vowed silently.

 <p>
  <span>
   "My lord," she began, her voice steadier than she felt, "the Crystal was already damaged when we found it in the Vault of Primal Urges. We—"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Excuses!" Shao roared, cutting her off. "You'll face the consequences upon your return to Taiwan. Perhaps some time in the Empress's Gardens will teach you the value of following orders."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur's blood ran cold. The Empress's Gardens in the Da-An District of Taipei were notorious—a place where disobedient officials disappeared, only to return as shells of their former selves. She fought to keep her face neutral, even as her mind raced.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I understand, my lord," she said, bowing her head in fake submission. As she did, an idea formed in her mind. It was dangerous, potentially catastrophic, but might be her only salvation.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "If I may have a moment to collect myself," Dilinur requested, her voice barely above a whisper.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Without waiting for a response, she cut the holographic connection by pressing a red button on the wall. The chamber fell silent as the holograms disappeared. All was quiet except for the low hum from Moondust.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur turned to face the Crystal, her eyes filled with desperation and determination. "Moondust, do you see that bald man that just screeched at me?" she hissed.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Moondust replied with only a low rumble.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "His name is Zu-Shao Qin. My superior, my oppressor," Dilinur said angrily. "I need you to modify his disposition towards me. Immediately."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Crystal's facets shimmered, considering her demand. "Compliance," it intoned after a moment.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   One word. Just one word, yet it made Dilinur's heart soar with hope.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As Moondust began to hum, Dilinur nervously twirled her ornate hairpin. What she was doing was treasonous, but she saw no other way out.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As the hum from Moondust's core faded, it continued. "Inspect."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Another word. So brief. So ominous. Yet it was all Dilinur needed.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Let this work," she whispered to herself. "By all the gods, let this work."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur's heart pounded as she reactivated the holographic connection. The forms of Shao and Shazmeen appeared before her, and she held her breath, looking for any sign that Moondust's manipulation had worked.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Shao's face, once angry, now showed admiration. His amber eyes, previously cold, now regarded her with warmth. Dilinur felt elation rushing through her.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Dilinur. I was mistaken," Shao's voice rang out, smooth as silk. "Your performance has been nothing short of exemplary. To breach the Vault and retrieve the Moondust Crystal in such a short time. I must commend your dedication to the Imperium."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur struggled to keep her composure, stunned by the sudden change. "My lord, you honor me with your praise," she managed, her voice barely above a whisper.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Shao's hologram bowed deeply, a gesture that shocked Dilinur.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Governor?" Shazmeen's jaw dropped as her hologram moved toward the man's.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "As such, we must celebrate your achievements," Shao declared. "I propose a grand gathering in the Celestial Reach on Osram. It would be a fitting tribute to your service."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur's lips curled into a triumphant smile. "My lord is too kind," she purred, growing more confident. "Perhaps you could help facilitate such an event?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Of course, it would be my pleasure," Shao replied eagerly. "In fact, why not invite the Emperor himself? Your accomplishments surely warrant his attention, and it has been many seasons since he last visited the Sea of Storms."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   From the corner of her eye, Dilinur saw Shazmeen. The usually composed woman had her hand over her mouth, her eyes wide with shock and growing fear. Dilinur enjoyed the sight, feeling powerful in a new way.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Governor Qin, are you…" Shazmeen turned to Shao, her voice filled with unusual dread. "Are you well?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Of course I am well, Shazmeen. What sort of a question is that?" Shao's annoyance returned as he faced Shazmeen.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Shazmeen covered her mouth with both hands and stepped back, now looking at Dilinur with visible trembling. Dilinur sensed vulnerability from the Secretary, something she had never seen before.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   With a dramatic flourish, Dilinur bowed low to Shao's hologram. "My lord's generosity knows no bounds," she said, her voice dripping with false humility. "I look forward to the celebrations in Celestial Reach, on Osram's blessed soil."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I look forward to it," Shao echoed, nodding firmly, his serenity almost unsettling.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "No…no, wait," Shazmeen's trembling form approached Dilinur. "P-prefect Altai, if I may, would you tell me how—"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   But Dilinur cut her off with another firm press on the red button on the wall.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   As the meeting ended and the holograms disappeared, Dilinur's mind filled with possibilities.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The holograms vanished. After a moment of silence, she burst into wild laughter. The sound echoed off the walls, a mix of victory and madness.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "At last! No more groveling!" Raising both hands, she cried, her eyes wild with joy. "My time has come, Shao. You miserable, lecherous bastard!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Memories flooded her mind—Shao's sneering face, his hands pawing at her body, the humiliation burning in her chest as she endured his "favors" for advancement. Each memory fueled her rage.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You thought you could break me," Dilinur snarled, her fists clenching. "But now... now I'll remake the Five Realms. And there'll be no place in it for men like you!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Her laughter grew, bordering on hysteria. Visions of a new Imperium danced before her eyes—one built on her ideals, free from the corruption and abuse she'd suffered.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The hiss of hydraulics interrupted her thoughts. Dilinur whirled around, her heart leaping to her throat as the chamber's golden door slid open. He stepped inside, his tall, muscular frame filling the doorway.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Joon-Seok's usually composed face showed rare uncertainty—his brows furrowed, and his dark eyes gleamed with concern. His richly embroidered crimson coat, decorated with dragon designs in gold, caught the light as he moved toward her, the high collar emphasizing his regal features.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   His black hair, neatly swept back, framed his pale face. "Dilinur? I sensed... intense psionic emanations. Are you alright?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She quickly composed herself, smoothing her features into a mask of calm. "Joon-Seok, I'm fine. Better than fine, actually."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Is that so?" his brow furrowed with concern.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Tell me, my sweet prince," she purred. She strode toward him, taking his hands in hers, her eyes locking onto his. "How would you like to build an empire?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "How would I…?" For a moment, Joon-Seok stiffened, his brow furrowing deeper in surprise. His dark eyes searched hers, showing hesitation.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Realizing her mistake, Dilinur's cheeks flushed with embarrassment. She pulled back quickly, releasing his hands and stepping back with a blush coloring her pale skin. "I'm sorry, milord," she stammered softly, lowering her gaze. "I didn't mean to...come on so strong."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   But before she could retreat further, Joon-Seok's hands shot forward, catching her wrists in a firm yet gentle grip. He pulled her close, leaving her breathless as her blush spread across her cheeks.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Dilinur," he murmured, his voice filled with quiet power. "Never apologize. Not to me."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Her heart raced, her pulse quickening under the pressure of his hands, which held her with surprising tenderness. Dilinur blinked up at him, her initial embarrassment giving way to something deeper, something charged.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "So," Joon-Seok's lips curved into a smirk. "What kind of empire do you have in mind?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur leaned in closer, the air between them intense, her breath hot against his neck as she whispered, "The kind where you and I are at the center."
  </span>
