   “So, let’s recap.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn, Terrance, and Ernesto were sitting at a table at the
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Dancing Dragonflies
   </span>

<span>
   inn, eating a delicious lunch consisting of steak sandwiches and salads. None of them had woken for breakfast after getting clean and passing out in their beds; as a matter of fact, they’d only woken about twenty minutes ago. Apparently getting into a fight with the Undead was exhausting in several ways.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance nodded agreeably, swallowed his latest bite of sandwich, and cleared his throat. “Keith was a necromancer, he turned himself into an Undead, and we killed him. And we have no reason to believe that the Research Council has access to any other necromancers or Undead.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “The Research Council has known about the Undead-Mist link for several years,” Ernesto added softly. “It doesn’t make sense for them to just kill any necromancers they find, if that’s true. We might want to keep an eye out anyway.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn nodded at the necromancer appreciatively. “Exactly what I’m thinking. But I’m trying to figure out the next step here. We can’t exactly go after the Research Council. It’s got too much power here, and we don’t have any solid evidence to bring to the Council of Winds.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “And that’s assuming the Council’s not in on it,” Terrance pointed out. “I’m thinking that we might just have to let this go. For now. It’s not like the plan on how to deal with the Mist has changed, right?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn grunted a reluctant affirmative. “That said, I think it’s clear that we need to get stronger. Just in case we have to deal with the Undead again. I mean, if you think about it, there has to be Undead on the surface creating the Mist that need to be dealt with, and while that
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    shouldn’t
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   be our problem, neither should this whole Mist thing to begin with. It wouldn’t hurt to be prepared.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I’ll go through the Compendium and look for ranged attacks like we talked about,” Ernesto volunteered.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Mmm… you’re right. I’m out of practice; I haven’t needed to use my blade for a while. It’d do me good to spar with you and shake some of the rust off.” Terrance’s face twisted into a roguish smirk. “You in, Maeryn?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn smiled. “Sure thing. Might have to wait a bit, though. Dan and Frankie should be back this evening, and then we need to honor my contract with that nobleman.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Contract? What contract?” Terrance asked, confused.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Oh, right, you weren’t there when I was explaining this.” Maeryn quickly reiterated their financial situation and the contract she’d taken to transport a nobleman to and from Zephyr.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance nodded slowly. “If that’s what we gotta do, then I guess that’s what we’re doing. It does mean that we’ll be gone during any potential investigations of that facility, which could be good. Be careful, though. Noblemen have a bad tendency to backstab.” He grimaced. “Speaking from experience. Don’t ask.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Ernesto’s mouth clicked shut, clearly having been about to ask exactly that.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Don’t feel too left out,” Maeryn told him sympathetically. “Terrance is very closed-lipped about his past. I’m just as curious as you are, but he’ll tell us when he’s ready.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “If I’m ready,” Terrance corrected mildly.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “When he’s ready,” Maeryn repeated, smirking mischievously at the rogue.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance rolled his eyes but didn’t bother correcting her again, electing to take a rather large bite of his sandwich. Ernesto’s lips twitched, and his chest shook slightly, like he was suppressing a laugh, but he managed to hold it in quite well. Maeryn counted it as a success anyway.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   With nothing else she wanted to bring up to the others, Maeryn returned her attention to her lunch. It really was quite tasty.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   It was at that moment that Dan and Frankie walked in and immediately spotted them, the engineer waving an enthusiastic hello as they came over to join them. Gerald the Seemingly Everpresent glanced over, holding up two fingers and raising an eyebrow, clearly asking whether to make another couple of lunches for the two newcomers.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn gave him a nod, receiving a thumbs-up in response before Gerald started fixing up the food. Then the hunter focused on her returning companions. “Hey there you two. Food’ll be out for you pretty quick. How was the trip?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Uneventful,” Dan reported simply. “Nothing weird happened. We got there, they spent the evening paying their respects. They mostly just talked about what’s happened in the last year, and then the father started telling his girls stories of their mother.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Frankie sighed. “We would have been back last night, but they wanted to stay the night. Something about a Zephyrian tradition of seeing the start of a new year together under a blue sky.”

  <br/>
</span>
<p>
<span>
   Ernesto and Terrance nodded simultaneously at that. “It’s one of the ways that we pay respect to our loved ones that have passed, especially for immediate family,” the necromancer quietly explained. “Once per year, if we can, we spend the night with the spirits of those past and greet the sun and sky together, like we would when they lived. It’s to help both the spirits and those they left behind feel a little less lonely, and to remind those who have gone beyond that they are remembered.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Do you Geovans have any similar traditions?” Terrance asked curiously.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Frankie looked down, her expression looking a little sad. It was quite striking, actually - Maeryn had never seen that expression cross her face. “I… I have a portrait of my father. He died when I was just a little girl. I only have a couple of vague memories of him, but my mom always told me that I could talk to him, through his portrait, when I felt alone or needed someone to listen.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn struggled not to let her jaw drop or face slacken in surprise. She’d had no idea at all. She hadn’t even known that Frankie’s father was dead. The girl had never mentioned it before, she was sure. But still, they’d known each other for years! How had she not known?
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Was she just that terrible of a friend? Just so focused on the Mist problem for all those years that she’d blinded herself?
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Frankie raised her head and looked at Maeryn, seemingly aware of her shock. “I never brought it up because, well, it happened a really long time ago, well before we met, and definitely a long time before we became friends. It wasn’t something I tried to hide, really. It just never came up.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Dan wrapped an arm around her sympathetically, before looking up to answer Terrance directly. “When we can, when someone close to us dies, we try to have a portrait or treasured keepsake, something that they loved. We don’t talk about their spirits, usually, but we keep them close, and talk to them sometimes.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The answer seemed to satisfy both Zephyrians. “Sounds like both our cultures value remembering those lost, just differently,” Ernesto murmured. “It’s nice to know that things aren’t so different even when we grow up so differently.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   There was a murmur of agreement from everyone at that.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The mood was broken by Gerald swooping in with his characteristic energy and delivering two plates of steaming-hot steak sandwiches and salads, alongside two large glasses of water, for Dan and Frankie. The smell and resulting stomach growls were convincing enough for them to dig in, with muffled “thank you”s to the innkeeper, who accepted with a grin before vanishing back to his station.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Dan wolfed down three large bites before visibly remembering that he’d had questions for Maeryn and the others. He swallowed, took a quick gulp of water, and then turned his attention to the three who had remained on Airspire during his trip. “So, how’d the facility infiltration go?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn’s face darkened. “Badly.” She quickly filled him and Frankie in on what they’d discovered, finishing with, “... and then Keith tried to kill us. It was close, but we managed to kill him instead.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Dan leaned back, a very disturbed expression on his face. “A sentient Undead? A necromancer who turned himself into an Undead? I could swear I read that exact thing in a children’s story growing up. I’m honestly getting really uncomfortable with how much we’re entering that territory, but… I guess reality is stranger than fiction sometimes.” He sighed. “So, what’s the plan, Captain?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Our financial situation hasn’t changed. We’re still transporting the nobleman Samuel Parlor to Zephyr and back,” Maeryn replied simply. “Then we focus on Ernesto and the inverted necromantic mana plan. In the end, it doesn’t matter that the Zephyrian Research Council - you know what? That’s too long, I’m abbreviating it. It doesn’t matter that the ZRC hoarded critical knowledge; it doesn’t change what we need to do. It just means we can’t trust them in the future.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   She received a round of nods. “So, the contract. When’s that happening?” Terrance queried.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I’m meeting with Parlor later today for final confirmations, but unless something’s changed, we should be leaving tomorrow morning. Remember we’ll be gone for a few weeks. If you’ve got anything going on here, try to wrap it up.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Frankie bit her lip before apparently coming to a decision. “Maeryn? If… I know you were looking for a backup pilot, to make long distance trips easier on us. I might know someone? I think he’d be a good fit, and, well… he’s a friend. And this
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    is
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   a long distance trip. Can you make some time this evening to meet with him?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn was startled by the request, but quickly recovered, nodding. “Sure. I’ll make time whenever you want, Frankie.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Frankie nodded decisively, and picked up the rest of her sandwich, somehow devouring the whole thing in only three bites before chugging some water to wash it down. Everyone watched in horrified fascination - how exactly had she managed that?
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Did you just… unhinge your jaw like a snake?” Terrance asked, struggling to reconcile what he’d just seen with what he knew of reality.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Mm, that was tasty!” Frankie declared, ignoring the question. “I’m gonna go talk to my friend! See you tonight around dinner!” And then she strode off like she hadn’t just broken her colleagues’ minds.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Don’t think too hard about it,” Maeryn advised. “Engineers are a different breed.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The others nodded, accepting her wisdom on the matter, before Terrance stood as well. He’d finished his sandwich some minutes ago and had been picking at the salad, but he evidently was done eating. “If we’re going to be gone for a few weeks, I’m going to go take care of a few things around town. I’ll be back around dinner.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   As the rogue was leaving, Ernesto seemed to realize something. “Oh, Dan. I learned and used an Undead-type spell while we were in the facility.
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Command Undead
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   . When you’re done eating, do you want to go over what I learned?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Dan swallowed a bite from his salad before answering. “We probably should. That’s the first spell you’ve cast from that concept line, right? Maybe there’ll be some clue in the mana patterns and your impressions that tie it together with the other spells you’ve used.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Sounds like you two have your plans for the afternoon set,” Maeryn observed, then rose from the table herself. “I’ll go talk to Parlor, then.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Good luck,” Dan offered distractedly, while Ernesto nodded at her.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn raised a hand in farewell, then turned and walked out of the inn. She had a nobleman to see.
  </span>
