   “Unfortunately, something’s come up that I can’t ignore,” Maeryn apologized. She was with the family she’d contracted to, standing just outside Stonewing, and trying to make sure that there were no hard feelings about the sudden changes to their arrangement. “So I won’t be able to fly with you today. But my First Mate and pilot will get you to and from Mount Peace.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The father’s expression grew troubled. “It must be terribly important if it’s enough to keep a captain from their airship. Is everything alright?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Honestly? No, but I’m hoping to get it resolved today while you’re gone. Shouldn’t take more than a few hours. It’s just urgent enough that I can’t put it off.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The man’s face cleared up. “Ah. One of
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    those
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   issues. I completely understand. Good luck, Captain Maeryn.” He extended his hand to shake.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn took it firmly. “May the winds bring you peace.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “And you, success,” the man replied with a sad smile. “Come on, kids. Time to take a look inside the airship!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Oooh!” A pair of twin girls, perhaps five or six years old, practically threw themselves up the ramp to explore, their father following a bit more sedately. Thankfully, Dan and Frankie were waiting for them.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance, next to Maeryn, gave a low whistle. “Starting to sound like a real Zephyrian there, Maeryn,” he murmured softly. “Got the farewells down like you grew up around here.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Those aren’t too hard. You just need to think for a moment about the other person’s circumstances,” Maeryn replied, keeping her voice just as low. “Still having trouble with the swears, though. What even is the World’s Breath anyway?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I’ll tell you later,” the rogue promised. “There’s a cultural history thing behind it, you’ll probably think it’s interesting.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Ernesto, who was quietly standing on Maeryn’s other side, looked at the two of them for a moment before returning his gaze to Stonewing, which was starting to move down the runway. Only a minute later, the airship had taken flight and was rapidly becoming much smaller in their vision. “So, um… when do we want to… do the thing?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “The best time to run an infiltration depends on the place and times of the people using it,” Terrance lectured. “Also, your method. If you’re trying to blend in with a bunch of people, you want to use the busiest hours. If you’re trying to be undisturbed, you want the quietest hours. If you want to get past security guards, you need to pick the time where they’re most at ease.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   He paused for dramatic effect. When the silence stretched on, Maeryn sighed and gave him what he wanted. “And? What are we dealing with?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance smirked, but quickly grew serious. “My observation on the place is limited - I never made it inside before. But I did notice that the researchers using the place tend to be most active from early afternoon to late evening, leaving shortly before midnight. Since we’re strictly investigating without being disturbed, our best bet is under the cover of night. If we aim for three hours past midnight, any security guards should be well and truly lulled into complacency, and there should be minimal chance of any researchers actually being there. That also gives us as much time as possible to investigate, in case the facility is larger than expected.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn nodded thoughtfully, while Ernesto looked at Terrance with more than a bit of awe in his face. “That’s amazing! I never would’ve thought of all that!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Well, I
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    am
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   quite good at what I do.” Terrance seemed quite pleased with the flattery for a moment before realizing who it came from, coughing to regain his composure. “That said, there’s no telling what we’ll find inside. We should be prepared for anything, including making a quick getaway if needed.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   His companions nodded in agreement. “How’re we getting in?” Maeryn probed.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “We don’t have much choice. There’s only one entrance: the front door, so to speak.” The rogue shook his head. “I’ve inspected the door, and we shouldn’t have any trouble getting in. It looks like a pretty standard tumbler lock, nothing fancy. I’ll be able to pick the lock pretty quickly. Anything beyond that we’ll have to figure out as we go.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Got it. I think we’re about as prepared as we can be, then,” Maeryn concluded. “Since the operation’s tonight, let’s spend the morning getting any last-minute prep work done, and get an early dinner and solid nap right afterwards. We’ll want to be well-rested for tonight. Any objections?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “None here.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “S-sounds good, Captain.”
  </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
   It was an hour after midnight, and Maeryn was wide awake. She’d already cleaned her weapons and changed into her Geovan outfit - it was less cumbersome than her Zephyrian airship captain uniform. This time, however, she’d purchased a dusky blue hoodie to wear over her gray tank top. She had no interest in freezing in the apparently-chilly nights that flying cities had like she had the last time she’d gone on an operation with Terrance, and the hood would disguise her hair reasonably well too.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Besides, the hoodie paired surprisingly well with her cargo pants, which were a dark, dusty brown in color. Maeryn had no regrets at all on the purchase.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   A quiet knock on the door leading to the adjoining room startled Maeryn out of her reflections. “Come on in,” she called.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Ernesto walked in, wearing his typical clothes - a long-sleeve white shirt with a dark green vest, and simple brown leggings - but he’d added a gray hooded cloak for the operation under Terrance’s suggestion. The hood was down at the moment, and he looked troubled. “Captain… Do you have a minute?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Of course. What’s on your mind?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I, um… does Terrance know, yet? That I’m a necromancer?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Oh. Maeryn felt a stab of regret. She probably should have included Ernesto in that discussion, in retrospect. Nothing she could do about that now, though. “He does. I had a word with him in private last night. Sorry for not including you in the decision.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Ernesto rapidly shook his head. “No, no, it’s fine! You know him better than I do, anyway. I… I don’t really know how to judge if someone’s ready to hear that kind of thing. I mean, it’s hard when everyone always thinks of the Undead, you know?” He squeezed his eyes shut for a moment. “But that’s… that’s not what I wanted to ask about.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Go on. I’m listening,” Maeryn cajoled gently.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I… I found a spell in my Master’s Compendium. I thought it might be useful, in a pinch. If we need to deal with the Undead. But… but it’s from the Undead side of things. It’s called
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Command Undead
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   . If, if we end up having to fight one or something, I thought maybe I could get it to, to stop, maybe?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Ernesto was wringing his hands, clearly overwrought with anxiety. “I just… I don’t want to be the kind of necromancer who, who works with the Undead. At all. I know I’m going to have to do at least a little, in order to properly make inverted necromantic mana, but… is this really okay? I don’t want to change you all’s opinion of me. I just… the idea of…” He took a deep breath, gathering his words. “The idea of taking control of the Undead… if I do that, doesn’t that change things?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn didn’t answer immediately. The truth was, Ernesto’s concerns were well-founded. They didn’t know each other that well, yet. She didn’t have a large draw of experience with him to be able to put all of her faith that he wouldn’t turn out to be the kind of person who was consumed by their own power. People who suddenly gained power could change. If Ernesto did end up being able to use
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Command Undead
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   tonight, it could alter her perception of him.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   But that wasn’t what he needed to hear. It was obvious, right now, that Ernesto was looking for a safe place to ride out the earthquake to come. And honestly, it actually reassured Maeryn a bit that Ernesto was concerned about what would come.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   With that in mind, there was only one thing she could say. “I think,” she began slowly, and Ernesto looked up to meet her gaze timidly. “I think that as long as you’re focused on using it for the right reasons, and only when it’s really necessary, that even if it does change things, it won’t make them worse, in the end.” She nodded to herself. “I’m glad you found the spell. Like you said, it might help in a pinch. Just don’t be too eager to cast it, okay?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   All of the tension in Ernesto’s body left him at once, and he almost slumped against the wall in naked relief. “I… yes. Yes, you’re right. Of course. Thank you, Captain.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “You can call me Maeryn, you know. I don’t stand on formality,” she offered.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Ernesto shook his head sharply. “I’m not ready for that. It’s nothing against you, I promise, I just… I feel better when I can give people the respect they’re afforded. And you’re definitely the Captain. Sorry, Captain.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “It’s fine, it’s fine. Maybe someday.” Maeryn did her best to give him a reassuring smile, and was gratified when Ernesto replied with a smile of his own, albeit hesitant and unsure.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The necromancer shifted a bit. “Um, if you don’t mind me asking…”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Go ahead.”
  </span>
</p>
<span>
<br/>

  <br/>
</span>
<p>
<span>
   “How… How do you fight? I don’t see any weapons on you. Do you use magic, too?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn shook her head. “Sort of? I mostly fight with these.” She injected a tiny jot of magic into the runic sequence in her right vambrace, holding it up to show Ernesto the blade as it popped out. “I was a hunter in Geova, and all of us are trained in two spells:
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Body Enhancement,
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   a support magic that makes me faster and stronger for a bit; and
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Fireball
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   to burn corpses and work as an emergency mid-range option. So I’ll likely be taking point in any confrontations - though hopefully, we can avoid any of those tonight.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Ernesto looked very impressed. “You can use
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    Body Enhancement
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   ? That’s really rare!”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Is it really? Every hunter in Geova can use it.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   If anything, that only seemed to astonish him further. “Wow. It’s not common at all up here in Zephyria. Not many people manage to get the requisite physical strength and knowledge of anatomy to pull it off. You must’ve worked really hard to get good at it.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn couldn’t exactly disagree; she could still remember how exhausting and punishing her hunter training had been. “What about you? How do you fight? Do you have a preference on spells?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Ernesto looked down, a little uncomfortable. “I’m not that agile, so up-close isn’t good for me. I guess, as a necromancer, I should be trying to keep my distance? But my only combat spells are touch-range…”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Well, with any luck we shouldn’t get into any fights, so it won’t be a problem. But, yeah, maybe in the next few days you can look up a ranged attack? Don’t worry about it for tonight, just stay behind me, okay?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Okay.” Ernesto took a deep breath and nodded. “Right. I can do that.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   They stood in silence for a long moment, Ernesto clearly lost in thought about the operation tonight while Maeryn contemplated whether they would ever end up in enough combat that she would need others to fight at her side.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   It wasn’t as though she didn’t have any experience fighting in a team. Hunters had to do it sometimes, when Mistwarped beasts came in packs. But here she was, talking about formations like they were some… some
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    adventuring party
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   from children’s storybooks. How had her life become like this?
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Oh, right. She’d literally gathered a team to save the world. Sometimes it was hard to remember that. She certainly didn’t feel like some chosen hero or amazing leader. Maeryn was just making it up as she went along, doing the best she could.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   But if there was one thing she knew for sure? She knew that she couldn’t ignore the presence of the Undead on Airspire.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn breathed in deeply and released it, steadying her nerves. “You ready to go?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Y-yeah.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Then we might as well meet Terrance outside. I think we could use some air.” Maeryn moved to open the door, and Ernesto silently followed.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The rogue was waiting for them outside, lurking in the shadows of an alleyway not fifteen feet from the front door. “You’re early,” he observed idly. “We don’t need to get going for another half hour.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Might as well get going now, then. Just in case we run into a delay,” Maeryn challenged.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance’s eyes glittered with something unidentifiable even as he smirked. “True enough. Let’s go, then. Follow me.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Unlike their previous mission on Cloudreach, there was no upper farm layer on Airspire, so the roads and alleyways were dimly lit by the moon and stars in the sky. This simultaneously made things easier and harder in ways. It was a little easier to keep track of Terrance’s movements in the dark as they darted between alleyways and forgotten side roads, but the Zephyrian seemed bound and determined to stay as concealed in the dark as possible, making the trip take far longer than it likely could have.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Finally, though, they reached a strange, out-of-the-way place at the end of a side alley some distance away from Zephyr Research Central. Oddly, the alley widened into a circular dead-end, but as they got closer, Maeryn could barely make out… steps. Leading down into the ground. It didn’t go far - two and a half, maybe three meters at most - but there was a strong-looking metal door sealing the entrance.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “This is the place,” Terrance whispered. “We’re a little early, but not enough to make a difference I think. Let me pick the lock.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn heard Ernesto shift behind her, and she swallowed down the nervous anxiety that bubbled in her gut. “Right.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance crept down the stairs almost soundlessly - even when she was listening for it, he was almost too quiet for Maeryn to hear - and then he reached into a pouch that his cloak had concealed, pulling out what could only be lockpicks. It took him a mere fifteen seconds of fiddling before there was a tiny
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    click
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   , and the rogue put his tools away. “Alright. Come on down.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn walked down the stairs, trying to mimic Terrance’s footwork and frowning to herself as she was acutely louder than he had been. Ernesto also followed, and she found herself almost wincing at his heavy footfalls. The necromancer figured something out after the first two steps, though, and the rest of it was quieter, though still too loud in Maeryn’s opinion.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   When they were all crowded around the door, Terrance slowly pushed it open, revealing… an empty hallway. Maeryn didn’t know what she had expected, but she was still disappointed.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance, however, quickly walked in, murmuring hurriedly for them to come inside. The moment Ernesto was inside, he closed the door again and locked it from the inside, casting them all into complete darkness.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “W-why’d you close the door?” Ernesto whispered fearfully.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “We ought to be the only ones sneaking in here tonight,” Terrance replied quietly. “Don’t want anyone to get suspicious, seeing an open door in the middle of the night. Just a moment.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   There was a little shuffling sound, like digging something out of a pack, and then there was a light. Not much, just enough to see the area immediately around them in a tiny, muted glow. Terrance was holding up what looked like a glowing marble. “It’s a Light Marble,” he explained quietly to his companions. “Pretty simple, really. Got the rune for light etched on it. Give it a spec of mana and it’ll cast a bit of light for you. Great for work like this, really.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Ernesto was visibly breathing a little easier, now that he could see, and Maeryn had to admit that she felt the same. She would have been completely useless in the dark. “There has to be some form of light source down here, for when people are actually working.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Yep. But we’re not going to use it if we don’t have to. No telling if whatever they’re using is hooked up to something that’ll tell ‘em that we were here. Better to rely on our own light,” Terrance explained.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “That makes sense,” Ernesto muttered. “So, um… we’re in. Now what?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Now? Now we explore. Pick a door, any door, and let’s check it out.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn immediately pointed to the first door on the left. “We’re going to look through them all anyway, may as well be methodical about it. Let’s work our way forward.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Works for me.” Terrance walked quickly and quietly over to the door in question, leaving Maeryn and Ernesto to hurriedly follow him, trying to stay within the small radius of light emitted by the marble.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The first door revealed an empty room. The second, a desk and two chairs. Terrance opened the desk drawers, but shook his head, finding nothing, so they moved on.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   The third and fourth doors had nothing noteworthy behind them either, but the fifth one - the third door on the left, to be precise - had what looked like a small laboratory. There was a long table holding various research equipment, alongside multiple shelves of various things that Maeryn didn’t recognize. Reagents, maybe? Dan would have known.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Ernesto stepped forward, examining them curiously. Terrance followed, keeping the Light Marble glowing, letting the necromancer work. But Ernesto didn’t say anything, instead turning to the side and picking up a notebook from the table. He flipped through it, eyes rapidly scanning the pages and grimacing. He looked back at the collection of reagents. “These ingredients… it wouldn’t work, but I can see why they thought it might.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “What are you talking about?” Terrance asked, perhaps a little more harshly than deserved.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Ernesto seemed to realize where he was, and turned to face his colleagues. “They were… they were experimenting with the Mist. It looks like… they were trying to reproduce it? They definitely discovered that the Undead generate the Mist, but I think… I think they were trying to create Mist bombs, no Undead necessary.” He gestured at the shelves. “I don’t recognize all the ingredients, but the ones I do… they’re trying to create a magic rot effect. Airborne, I think, based on the research notes. It’s… it’s really nasty stuff.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance hissed, visibly angry at the idea.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Ernesto flinched. “It… It gets worse,” he added after a second. “The latest notes… they plan on using Undead samples soon. The skin, the muscle… the black ooze…”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I vote we burn the place down,” Maeryn said darkly.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Seconded,” Terrance immediately agreed. “Nothing good can come of using Undead in alchemy.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “We can’t!” Ernesto cried out. “Don’t you think they’ll just try again in another facility?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn grimaced. He had a point. “Okay. Let’s think this through for a minute. First, the Undead dies tonight. Any objections to that at least?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “None.” Terrance’s voice was positively a growl.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Ernesto said nothing, just watching and listening.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Second, we know that they have a necromancer. They couldn’t have raised an Undead without one.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “R-right,” Ernesto agreed.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “If we want to cut off all Undead-related experiments, we need to either stop the necromancer, or the researcher. Assuming they’re not the same person,” Maeryn continued her train of thought.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Makes sense so far.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn nodded to herself. “Ernesto, does that notebook have a name on it? Who the researcher was? Any details on who the necromancer is? Anything?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “J-just a moment. I’ll check.” They waited for another couple of minutes as Ernesto skimmed the book once more, checking the inside of the front cover, and every page that had anything written on it. “N-nothing about the researcher, or the necromancer. But, um… there’s a letter that they use to refer to their backer? It’s only used once, when they made a note to request more reagents.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “What’s the letter?” Terrance demanded.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “C,” Ernesto said simply.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn rubbed her eyes. “Okay. Ernesto, hold onto that notebook for now. We should explore the rest of this place. Maybe we’ll find more clues elsewhere.”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   They quietly agreed, and onward they went. Unfortunately, after opening every single door save the one in the very back of the hallway, they didn’t find anything useful.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Terrance hesitated, his hand on the last door. “This doesn’t make sense,” he muttered.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “What doesn’t?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “I know I saw Mist coming out that front door, before. I know it. But we haven’t seen a single trace of Mist in any of the rooms so far, or in the hallway.” Terrance shook his head. “If the Mist was strong enough, pervasive enough, to get out the door before… why haven’t we seen a trace of it?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   Maeryn and Ernesto both stilled in place. “If the Undead is kept in the back, in this last room like we expect… then this door here would have had to have been opened shortly before the front door. Right?” Maeryn postulated slowly.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Maybe? Or…” Terrance looked back at the door. “Or, what if the Undead isn’t locked up? What if… what if the Undead
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    is
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   the researcher?”
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   And then the door opened on its own, and Mist spilled out of the room, flowing down the hallway, and a voice came from inside the room,
  </span>
<em>
<span>
    inside the Mist,
   </span>
</em>
<span>
   sending chills down their spines.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
   “Oh? It seems I have guests.”
  </span>
