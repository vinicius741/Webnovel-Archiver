Then there was the unspoken understanding that I would be trained to use the Force by a group who had been refining the process for thousands of years. I felt I had done alright on my own, but seeing the master Jedi use telekinesis so casually, I couldn’t help but suspect I was doing something wrong—lacking some understanding of it that they had and I didn’t in my fumbling around and experimenting with converting what I knew to this new system.</span></p>

It was small enough to be crewed by one, perhaps with a small complement of droids, but looked large enough to have its own living quarters.</p>

<p class="cnNmNTJmMWMyMGM0ZTQwMTU4ZDhmY2ZiZTc5ZWYxYTg2" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0">I found the room right where he said it would be and put my things down. The room was small, but livable—with a nicely sized bed that folded into the wall to save space, a toilet/sink combo that did likewise, and a small desk/table that also folded in with a chair magnetized to the floor. A rug covered most of the floor space and, given the way everything could just be folded up into the walls or moved into a corner, I had a feeling that was an intentional design choice and the quarters likely doubled as a training room. Possibly meditation as well, given the transparent metal window that one wall was that could be ‘closed,’ or rather become opaque with the touch of a button.</p>

<p class="cnM5OTcxNWNhMmJkNTQ3YWI5MTNhM2QyYzQyMDg0OGEw" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Sure,” I nodded, turning and giving him my attention, waiting for instruction. Instead, he motioned for me to follow.</p>

<p class="cnNjYTRjYWQ0MWQyNDQ4Nzg4Y2ZkMWZmZTY1NjY5M2Nk" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Flight controls,” I answered immediately. “I don’t know the specifics, beyond that this is the control yoke and this is a throttle.”</p>

<p class="cnMwMDRiMTQ0MGFmZTQ1YTlhYWM2ODIwNDRmYjk3ZTE2" style="margin-bottom: 0">The old man nodded and leaned back in his chair, his brown eyes watching me like a hawk. “Close your eyes, then open your mind. <em>Listen</em><span style="font-style: normal"> to the Force.

I lowered my mental shields for a moment and winced at the volume—the spaceport was even rowdier than the city, because here it was a concentration of alien species all with conflicting emotions, desires, and thoughts. At least among the other Zeltrons, the usual prevailing thought/emotion was <em>h</em><em>appy</em><span style="font-style: normal"> </span><span style="font-style: normal">with a side of </span><em>h</em><em>orny</em><span style="font-style: normal">.

It was effectively the same thing as sensing mana in the environment, except with this new power. The so-called ‘Force.’ I’d been practicing that for years already—since I was born, in fact. I’d never felt it guiding me, however.</span></p>

I felt the controls around and in front of me. Something </span><span style="font-style: normal">stood out from everything else. I wouldn’t call it any kind of guiding force. Not really. It felt like an… echo? Kind of like fingerprints or wear marks showing which keys on a keypad or keyboard had been used most often.</span></p>

The ship hummed to life around us. Feeling what came next, I hit another button and felt the ship shudder as the ramp retracted and the hatch closed. Opening my eyes, I looked over the readouts and saw that they all sort of <em>felt right</em><span style="font-style: normal">.</span></p>

A moment later, we were approved and given a vector and speed. After that, everything was just… moving and pressing things in the right sequence and following those impressions. Soon enough, we were in the black, the planet glowing blue below us and other ships and the space stations and satellites showing up on sensor readouts.</span></p>

You have good instincts. There are, of course, tales of entities that live within the hyperspace lanes themselves, especially the further one gets from the core. As with all tales told by spacefarers, there is perhaps some grain of truth to them. Even the most powerful Jedi tread carefully here and dare not open themselves up too much. After all, there are remnants of things in the universe, </span><em>dark</em><span style="font-style: normal"> things, that are naturally drawn to the light and will strike at any vulnerable mind if the opportunity arises. Guard yourself well here, padawan.”</span></p>

Through that mastery comes the ability to secure oneself against malicious forces.” Seeing I was nodding along, he addressed my last point. “As for the Force… you are not giving yourself over to it to allow it to manipulate your actions, nor should you. Not unless you are prepared to accept everything that comes with that life. It is a difficult thing to do. I only know of one who has fully embraced it.

Much like the first, this one will involve your sense of the Force,” he explained as he walked into the ship’s small lounge area. A press of a button had the holo table descending into the floor, clearing up the space. Dooku held out his hand and, a moment later, a couple of small orbs floated out from his bedroom. Both of them lit up, coming to life as they powered on and hovered in place. “</span><span style="font-style: normal">These are training drones. When activated, they will shoot a low intensity laser at you. Your goal is to use the Force to predict when they’ll shoot and from where, and to not get hit. As you progress longer without being hit, the pain level of the laser will increase, as will the frequency of their shots, while the patterns they fly will grow more random and more difficult to predict. When you’re hit, the lasers will reset to their last level.”</span></p>

First a blindfold, then a helmet that blocks out both sight and sound.”</p>

The lure of freedom, the ability to get paid to cruise around the galaxy and do diplomacy, outside of any specific planetary or universal command structure, was too good to pass up.

It was a glancing blow to the arm and would have been non-lethal, but it was enough to register as a loss in the drones’ programming. As a Jedi Master, Dooku had taken on three padawans to date—Rael Averross, Qui-Gon Jinn, and… the third student he didn’t like to think about, given what had happened. Suffice it to say, he had some experience teaching young padawans. Generally, he knew what to expect in any given situation.</p>

She snagged one of the drones out of the air as it was about to fire, rolled, then brought the drone up to fire at the second one. The second drone dropped to the ground as its programming registered the hit as having disabled it while the second beeped and stopped charging since she wasn’t letting go—marking her the winner of this round.</p>

Who knew how many years and generations of evolution that had been imprinted upon humans and human offshoots to recognize certain signs, certain patterns.

I was coming in hotter than it recommended, but my own experience as an aerial mage and my reading up on the ship and its capabilities told me both that it could handle it and I could easily recover closer to the ground. It didn’t try to take control of me and make me do as it suggested—instead, it adjusted to what I was doing and seemed to pick the best possible path from there.</span></p>

Finally, the old man nodded. “Be honest and don’t be afraid.”</p>

It sounds like any group of executives or ranking officers. There are always disagreements, either with individuals or the body as a whole. It seems Master Dooku would like me to tweak their noses a bit for him. Well, </em><em>he did me a big favor by bringing me here and introducing me. It would be rude not to return the favor. It may reflect a bit poorly upon my job interview, but… one of their criteria is use of the Force and another is obviously someone who can keep their emotions in check. This would satisfy both of those and if they complain, I can feign ignorance and claim it’s a force of habit from shutting out other Zeltrons.</em></p>
