<p class="cnM2M2JhNjg4MjZmMjRhZmY4OGZmOGJmYjI1NjI0ZDA5" style="margin-bottom: 0">After speaking with the others, minus an absent Obi, and learning the status of the negotiations I had decided to go visit Jaster’s camp and see if anything had come of the information I’d learned about the woman I now knew as Bo-Katan Kryze and where she had run off to—and see if perhaps the Mandalorians had followed her home to eliminate that problem. I hoped they had.</p>
<p class="cnM4OWExMmM5ZTBlMTQwNDM5MGU2ZmYwZWFiMjViYjc2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNjMDczM2E5YjhmZjRmMTE4N2FhOTZhMzgxYTdlOTcy" style="margin-bottom: 0">Making my way through the camp, I knocked and let myself in to Jaster’s tent, finding the man as I usually did around this time, reading a book and drinking. He looked up and smiled. “Tanya. Good to see you’re up and moving.”</p>
<p class="cnMwYTA0MGNhNzc4NzRmYmFhN2YzYzY1ODNkMmExMmRm" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM3NzFiOTViYjdjZjQ2YmU4ZTU5OWUxZjJjMDVlY2Mz" style="margin-bottom: 0">“It’s good to be out of the tank,” I nodded, pulling a chair over and taking a seat.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZWU4NzU3NDg0YjRhZDM5MDJjMWQxZjIxNDM4ZTc2" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNmZTQ1ZjRkYmVkYjRjNWQ5MWYwOGU2YWEyM2EwN2U4" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Well, I’m glad you came. There’s some business I need to discuss with you. First, the rest of the Death Watch.” I sat up a bit straighter and he continued, “We found a few of them, but not Katan, and no one my men could identify as a leader. It looked like they were bugging out when my people got there, and everyone important already left.”</p>
<p class="cnNhMzNhNjgxZjIzNjQ5NDhhNTUwZjIwZWRjNTY2NDRj" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnM0OThjMDIxZWU0NDQ5NTBiMDYwNDNjYTNlMGY0ODQ3" style="margin-bottom: 0">“A shame,” I murmured, shaking my head. “Do you think they’ll try to continue their plan to destroy the opposing factions? Retaliate against the Jedi? Or go into hiding?”</p>
<p class="cnMzMjM4OTYwNTJiZTRhNjU5OTkzNTIwYWY1MDdhZTZk" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMwMTkyZGZmZGE4ZjRjYWM4NTdhODQ4ODdiOTY3NDIz" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Hard to say,” Jaster shook his head. “You killed their leader and took their symbol of authority, and the backup they might have used in Tor’s helmet for good measure. They’re probably scrambling to find another Mandalore. Hopefully, they’re too busy fighting among themselves to bother with us. I’ve got some people trying to track them down, but it’s gonna be hard. These fuckers have been hiding for years, so I’m not expecting much. I’m realistic. If we don’t find anything soon, we’ll pull back and settle in to watch.”</p>

<p class="cnM5ZDAzYTRlMGY5MzQ5NjU5NTgxZTVhMDE4YzRjZWMz" style="margin-bottom: 0">I nodded. Unfortunately, if an enemy combatant or group went to ground among the local population, and they happened to also be part of the local population, then it was nearly impossible to determine who was the enemy and who was a civilian, until someone started shooting. <em>Thankfully</em><span style="font-style: normal"> I had never encountered that tactic myself in the Empire, but I was aware of it from my time on my original Earth, and news of the war between America and whoever they were fighting when I last checked in the middle east. </span><span style="font-style: normal">Likewise, the Viet Kong had used the tactic against the Americans in the Vietnam war, and the Afghani had used it against the </span><span style="font-style: normal">Soviets</span><span style="font-style: normal"> in the ‘80s.</span></p>

<p class="cnNlNDRjMDE5NjBjZDQzNjNhNTQwNDUzZGUwYzVlNTUy" style="margin-bottom: 0">Jaster nodded and continued. “There is some good news, however. You did us a service, putting down Tor Vizsla and the rest of those fuckers, even if a few of ‘em got away. Final count was twenty-six dead. You said one escaped, and you let the wounded go.”</p>
<p class="cnMxMDI1YjY5OTc0NDRlOTE4OTkwMjBmMjdjYTU5NTg4" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMxNmYxOTRlMmU1ZDQ5YWE4YzUxOWJjZTFlMjkzNzRm" style="margin-bottom: 2em">“Fourteen wounded. Left their medic unharmed, so fifteen I let go,” I clarified. “I felt it was better to bog them down with a bunch of wounded. Especially since many of them were maimed.”“Yes, we saw the pile of <em>leftovers</em><span style="font-style: normal">,” Jaster murmured, shaking his head. “We’re watching hospitals and suppliers of prosthetics, hoping to use those to track them down.” He took a sip from his drink before picking up where he’d left off. “That’s a lot of armor. A lot of beskar. That’ll fill out a lot of armor pieces and give us several sets for younglings getting to the age where it’s time to start wearing armor. Bunch of weapons and other supplies, too. </span><span style="font-style: normal">They even had a few ships they left behind.</span><span style="font-style: normal">”</span></p>

<p class="cnNiZjBmYWVjMWZkZjQ5MjM4ZWVlNmJhMjYxZDc5MWVi" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal">Chuckling, Jaster nodded. “Well, it’s not going unrewarded. </span><span style="font-style: normal">We took the rest of ol’ Tor’s armor and melted it down into beskar ingots. When you come of age and stop growing, come bring it back and we’ll make armor out of it for you. And in the meantime,” he stood and put down his glass, before moving over to the side of the tent, where a steel box sat. Picking it up, he brought it over and placed it down on the floor between us, before sitting back down. Pushing it towards me with one foot, he knocked back the rest of his drink and grabbed his bottle to refill it. “Our armorer made you a little something.”</span></p>
<p class="cnNiZDRiNzBiOWIxMzQyNWNiMjc1NWQxMjY0ZjBmN2Ez" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMwZTg2OTljODZlYTQ3OTE5NmQyZWU1NmFkMTAxOWFk" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal">I looked down into the box and found several rectangular ingots of a gray metal run through with wavy lines that reminded me of Damascus steel. Sitting on top of it was a piece that had been hammered out </span><span style="font-style: normal">and had adjustable leather straps attached. I picked it up and turned it over, raising an eyebrow as I studied it.</span></p>
<p class="cnMyY2Q2MGRkOTE5NjRjODViNTA5YjkyZjgwYjNmZTY4" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnNhNzFhZWMyYWZlZjQ0OGE4MDkxNmYzMzJlZTc0YmYw" style="margin-bottom: 0">“<span style="font-style: normal">It’s a chest piece that’ll go under your clothes. The straps can be adjusted or replaced as needed and it’s segmented so that you can stretch it out and adjust it a bit as you grow. </span><span style="font-style: normal">Mostly, it’s meant to protect the heart and be easy to conceal,” he explained, and I nodded, finding and testing the switches and locking mechanisms on the back that would let it unlock, expand, and then lock into place again.</span></p>
<p class="cnMzNWI5MTkxOWU2NzRhMzI5OGEzZjQ2ZmFjMmM0MDJi" style="font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>
<p class="cnMwMjk0ZDlmZmUxYTRjOTdhOWIyNzUzYjIyOWY4ZmYx" style="margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-style: normal">Undoing my robe belt, I stood and pulled off my robe top, before slipping it on. A bit of playing with the straps got it comfortably secured down </span><span style="font-style: normal">over my red under layer, then I pulled the top back on, followed by my belt. When I sat down, I couldn’t tell it was there just by looking. I shifted and moved, testing my range of motion, and found it was comfortable and didn’t get in the way. “Thank you. I was already considering armor after this incident. It’s good to know I have something I can count on already. I saw how well it performed against my lightsabers and blaster bolts.”</span></p>

<p class="cnM5NDgyMmM0NjQ4ZDQ3MmRhMGUxMGY0Mjk1Mzg4ZGI3" style="margin-bottom: 0">“Your Master Dooku has it for the moment,” Jaster answered the unasked question. “We spoke about it and neither of us can agree to a solution. A Jedi made it about a thousand years ago. Mandalorians of the time, members of the Vizsla clan, struck against the Jedi in the heart of their power and took it for themselves. We’ve had it since then. The Death Watch turned it into their symbol of leadership when they split off after I formed the super commandos. It’s been in the hands of Mandalorians longer than it has the Jedi, and by any laws you care to look at in the known galaxy, that means it’s ours. Your master don’t see it that way and feels like it should be returned to the Jedi. I tried arguing that we would take it as payment for the Serenno job, but the stubborn old man wouldn’t budge.”</p>
<p class="cnNhY2EwNTE4NWZhMTQzNDdhYzlkZGU4YmQ2ZTMyYzkx" style="margin-bottom: 1em"> </p>

<p class="cnNkMTJmNGY0MDVkZjQ0OThiZTg5MDc1MDMxZDM5YmQ2" style="margin-bottom: 0">Frowning, I thought aloud as I considered it. “If I give it to you, it’s going to anger the High Council. Not that I wasn’t before, but this will just give them another excuse. It would also mean disregarding Master Dooku’s advice. If I return it to the Jedi, I risk damaging relations between your people and mine.”</p>

Part of it, anyway,” he admitted. “Way I see it, the Darksaber’s just a thing. Sure, people need symbols, and most often things become those symbols. A nation, a world, a flag, a song, a mask, a lightsaber, a code. All just things and ideas. But,” he held up a finger, before slowly pointing between himself and me, “sometimes, what they need more than a thing or some lofty ideal is a person. Just as I am for the True Mandalorians, Satine is for her people, and Tor Vizsla was for the Death Watch. People rally others behind them much more effectively than any <em>thing</em><span style="font-style: normal"> or idea. We need a symbol of the partnership between the Mandalorians and the Jedi. </span><span style="font-style: normal">A symbol that the past is behind us. Dead and buried. That we’re both looking to the future.”</span></p>

I moved on to verifying the new storage unit worked for the nav computer, then gave the computer I’d bought to the Mandos to keep for spare parts. I plugged in my laptop and set about reprogramming a bunch of things to tie various targeting and firing control systems together to make it easier on myself in the future—if I was firing the guns mounted on the wings, I also wanted to use the nose gun; if I was firing the turret, I only wanted to use the nose gun if the ship was pointed such that their fields of fire overlapped.</p>
