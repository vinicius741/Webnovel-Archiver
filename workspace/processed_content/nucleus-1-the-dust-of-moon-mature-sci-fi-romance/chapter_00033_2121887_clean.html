   Prefect's Study, No. 1 Zhongshan S Rd, Taipei, Taiwan, Imperium of Dragons territory
  </span>
 </p>

   </span>
   ilinur stared at the severed tentacle floating in the amber fluid of her Genome Sequencer. The appendage's surface was a mix of grays and purples beneath dried white residue. Its tip ended in a jagged tear where it had been forcibly separated from its owner.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Analyze genetic structure," she commanded.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The machine hummed to life. Holographic displays appeared above the cylinder, showing the specimen's DNA alongside scrolling data.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Cross-reference with known Radi-Mon variants. Keyword: 'Fenris', 'Jokull', 'Tiamat', 'Rakshasa'…" Dilinur's eyes tracked the information as she recited each horde's name, placing a hand to her forehead before sighing and uttering the last one. "…and 'Incubus'."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Cross-referencing," the machine responded in a neutral feminine voice. "Match found: 78% similarity to Fenris Horde genetic markers. Subject designation: Draug reproductive appendage."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur's fingers tightened slightly around the edge of her desk. "Specify Draug variant."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The scrolling data paused, reorganized, then continued faster. "Genetic structure suggests Alpha-class Draug, Primarch level. Anomalous sequences detected."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Subject S," Dilinur whispered.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She leaned closer to examine the dried white residue coating the tentacle's tip. After losing so many underlings to Skarn, this severed appendage was the only physical evidence they'd recovered.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Analyze residue composition," she ordered.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The machine's scanners pulsed with orange light. "Primary component: Fenris Horde reproductive fluid. Secondary trace elements detected: human saliva."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur's eyebrows lifted slightly. "Extract DNA profile from saliva trace and cross-reference with Imperial Citizen Database."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Extracting." The machine worked silently for several seconds. "No match found in Imperial Citizen Database. Subject is non-Imperial."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She reached for a cup of jasmine tea on her desk, taking a sip as she considered the implications.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Approximate time since sample separation from host."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Based on cellular degradation, sample was separated approximately 37 hours ago."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The timeline matched. Skarn had escaped from Amber Moon Spire at the same time that Xin did — alongside they knew whom. Dilinur rose from her chair and approached the Genome Sequencer, studying the floating tentacle.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The implications sent a cold thread of unease through her. If Skarn had used this appendage for its intended purpose...
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Save all analysis data," she ordered, returning to her desk. "Priority classification: Amber."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Data saved. Amber classification protocols engaged."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur opened a secure terminal connection and began typing her initial findings. Whatever had happened at Terminal 4, Skarn was dangerous enough on his own. If he had begun spreading the Nucleus Virus through direct contact, the situation was even worse than she had initially reported to Governor Qin.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The thought of facing the Governor's displeasure made her jaw tighten. As an Unblooded, her position was precarious enough without multiple failures on her record. She needed more information before presenting her next report—information that might mitigate the damage to her standing.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Behind her, the Genome Sequencer continued its silent analysis, the tentacle floating like a specimen in a museum of horrors.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The doors to Dilinur's study slid open without warning. Iron Roach strode in, his metallic frame catching the light. Red sunglasses concealed his eyes, but the upward curl of his lips suggested amusement at her startled glance.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Working late again, Dinu?" he asked, stepping aside to reveal Kaori Ouyang. "Or perhaps early. Hard to tell with you."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaori entered with measured steps, her amber eyes assessing the room before settling on Dilinur. Unlike Roach's casual disregard for protocol, she offered a formal bow.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Prefect Altai," Kaori greeted, straightening. Her black silk robe whispered against the floor as she moved further into the study. "We've returned with... interesting developments."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I assume you've had a productive night, then?" Dilinur closed her terminal with a subtle gesture, focusing her attention on the pair. "Like the Peons cleaning up Songnei Starport?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Ha! Fuck the Peons. Lazy good-for-nothings." Iron Roach remarked with a snort. He produced a small black lacquered box from his jacket pocket, setting it on Dilinur's desk with unusual care.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "It's from the Alliance bitch," he said. "Lorna Weiss."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur kept her expression neutral despite her surprise. "Where?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Terminal 5," Kaori replied, her voice tightening. "She slaughtered ten of our Bloodtroopers before we arrived."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Dinu's Bloodtroopers," Roach corrected, raising a finger. "If they served me, they'd be a lot tougher, and a lot less stupid."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur ignored the jab and reached for the box. "And this contains?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "A souvenir," Kaori said, bitterness in her voice. "A strand of her hair. We nearly had her, but the Alliance dogs came to her rescue."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur opened the box. Inside, resting on black velvet, lay the strand of blonde hair. It caught the light, showing softer wheat blonde among deeper gold.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "How did you confirm it's hers?" Dilinur asked.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Fucking Dinu, really?" Iron Roach laughed. "This is the Imperium. How many blondies can there be?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Answer my question." Dilinur stared into his crimson sunglasses.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "We had her restrained," Roach's artificial face twisted with pleasure at the memory. "Quite thoroughly, too. Until your egghead crashed through the glass wall with his green car. He's got that Valoran with him. Thomas Men Donut something? That punk from the Shanghai operation, with both of his silver arms."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Thomas 'the Obelisk' Mendoza," Dilinur mused. "Interesting."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "They were quick," Kaori added, clearly pained to admit it. "And their shuttle pilot..." Her hand drifted to a half-healed bruise at her temple. "...skilled."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I see." Dilinur took the strand from the box and approached the Genome Sequencer. "Did either of you notice anything unusual about Weiss?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Besides being crazy as shit?" Roach leaned against the wall. "Didn't even bother using weapons. Didn't the dossier say she's good with 10mm and...Psi-toe...eh, that stupid laser sword thing?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Not that," Dilinur placed the hair into a second analysis chamber of the Genome Sequencer. "Physical symptoms."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaori and Roach exchanged a glance.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Her eyes," Kaori said finally. "They were unfocused. She looked at the sky several times. Eye-rolling behaviors during spell casting."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur faced the Sequencer as she spoke. "Extract DNA profile and compare with saliva sample from previous specimen."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The machine hummed.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Roach straightened, suddenly interested. "Could've sworn this thing couldn't talk the last time you used it."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Had my Peons upgrade it after we processed the last Sand Lotus rebel. Less painful than needing to type," Dilinur added.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Processing," the computer announced. "Match confirmed. 99.8% genetic identity."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A heavy silence fell over the room.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Well, Dragon's dong," Iron Roach said, pushing away from the wall. "Subject S fucked the Alliance bitch!"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Jun has been avenged in ways I couldn't imagine," Kaori's voice held strange satisfaction. "She'll become one of them now."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Saliva, though. Means oral contact," Iron Roach added clinically. "Through the mouth. She must have been forced —"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Enough speculation," Dilinur cut him off, studying the genetic comparison displayed above her desk. "What matters is that Lorna Weiss has been exposed to the Nucleus Virus through Skarn. If her symptoms match what you've described... transformation may already be underway."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaori's features composed themselves, but her amber eyes showed vindictive pleasure. "A shame we couldn't capture her. Observing her transformation would have provided valuable data."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Indeed," Dilinur agreed, calculating the implications. "Another Radi-Mon serving the Imperial Legion would have been advantageous."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "And watching her suffer would have been satisfying," Kaori added softly, almost to herself.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur pretended not to hear, focusing instead on the analysis results. The strand of hair was unmistakably from the same person who had left saliva on Skarn's appendage. Whatever had happened between them, the consequences could reshape the balance of power between the Alliance and the Imperium.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   And perhaps, Dilinur thought privately, her own standing within the Golden Serpent Circle.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "If she transforms completely, she'll become a Hundkynda," Dilinur said, turning from the displays to face her subordinates. "A broodmother capable of accelerating Fenris Horde reproduction rate by 690%."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Iron Roach folded his arms across his chest, the servos in his cybernetic limbs whirring softly. "You think Skarn planned this specifically? Targeting a Psi Lynx?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Skarn may be a monster, but he's not mindless," Dilinur replied, her fingers moving across the Sequencer's interface. "Lorna Weiss possesses exceptional psionic capabilities. Any offspring she produces as a Hundkynda would inherit those traits."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaori's expression hardened. "Hundreds, or even thousands of psionic Radi-Mons. The Alliance wouldn't stand a chance." She paused, amber eyes narrowing. "Neither would we, if they turned against us."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The machine completed its analysis, projecting new data above the desk. Dilinur studied the molecular structure.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Something unusual in the genetic markers," she noted, zooming in on a specific sequence. "This pattern here is inconsistent with standard Fenris virus transmission."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Meaning?" Roach prompted impatiently.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur magnified the display further. "The virus appears to have mutated upon contact with Weiss's DNA. This is only possible if the infected human is…" she paused, realizing. "…a Nordling."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That even possible?" Roach grimaced. "The Alliance's scared shitless of Nordlings after '84. She wouldn't make two days before they lock her up or deport her."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Is the mutation significant?" Kaori asked, stepping closer to examine the projection.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Potentially," Dilinur responded, focusing on the display. "If the virus has modified itself to better integrate with her specific genetic structure, the transformation could be accelerated. Or..." she paused. "...it could manifest differently from standard Hundkynda conversion."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Iron Roach scoffed. "Different or not, the Alliance loses a valuable asset, and the Fenris Horde gains a powerful breeder."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "A strategic victory for us either way," Kaori added. "Though I'd have preferred to witness her deterioration personally."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur closed the magnified display with a gesture, returning to the broader genetic comparison. "We need to monitor Alliance communications. If Lorna has begun transforming, they'll likely transfer her to a secure facility. That information could be valuable to us."
  </span>
 </p>
 <span>
  <br/>
  The story has been illicitly taken; should you find it on Amazon, report the infringement.
  <br/>
 </span>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I'll have my scouts redirect resources," Kaori offered as Roach paced towards a window.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Do it," Dilinur ordered, turning back to face them. "Anything else about your encounter with Lorna? I want every observation, no matter how insignificant it seemed."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaori hesitated. "There were Radi-Mons at Terminal 5 as well. They seemed protective of her."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Protective?" Dilinur's interest sharpened. "Elaborate."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Bone Fiends and Skuggrs," Kaori explained. "They formed a perimeter around her, attacking us while ignoring her completely. Some even positioned themselves between her and our forces."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "As if they recognized her as one of their own," Iron Roach added. "Or at least, what she's becoming."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "If the Fenris Horde is already acknowledging her, Skarn may be attempting to establish direct psionic contact," Dinu commented. "The Hivemind could be influencing her even now."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "If this 'Hivemind' even exists," Roach shook his head with a grin. "Some theoretical cosmic brainwave thing coordinating all Radi-Mon hordes in the Five Realms? Sounds like stupid Valoran fiction to me."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "A shame," Kaori said, her features showing mock disappointment. "I had hoped her end would be more prolonged. If Skarn claims her quickly, she'll be spared the full experience of losing her humanity."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Your personal vendetta is noted, Kaori," Dilinur replied coolly. "But our concern is strategic implication, not your satisfaction."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaori's eyes flashed with anger before she lowered her gaze respectfully. "Of course, Prefect. My apologies."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Iron Roach shifted, his mechanical joints making soft adjustments. "Should we alert Governor Qin about these developments?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Not yet," Dilinur decided. "We need more information. And we need to address our other complication."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The missing android," Roach nodded. "I've called Marisol and Cheng. Let's see the little birds report on their failure."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur noted his choice of words: 'their failure', not 'ours'.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   But let it pass. The subtle distancing was expected from a veteran Golden Serpent when things went wrong.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Very good," she said, returning to her desk and reactivating her terminal. "Have them join us in Conference Room Three in fifteen minutes. Shazmeen should be included as well."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Secretary Varma is...unavailable," Kaori said, her tone neutral. "She's attending to matters for Governor Qin personally."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The implication hung in the air, requiring no elaboration. Shazmeen's position as the Governor's concubine was common knowledge, though rarely discussed openly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "I see," Dilinur replied, equally neutral. "Then we'll proceed without her. Fifteen minutes, Conference Room Three."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaori bowed before turning to leave. Iron Roach lingered a moment longer, his artificial face unreadable behind his red sunglasses.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "You know, Dinu," he said casually, "some might view multiple failures in such quick succession as...unfortunate timing for an Unblooded Prefect."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur met his gaze steadily. "Others might view it as an opportunity to demonstrate competence under pressure. Fifteen minutes, Roach."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Hmph. Just telling you how it is." His lips quirked in amusement before he inclined his head and followed Kaori from the room.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Alone again, Dilinur allowed herself a single deep breath. The tentacle floating in amber fluid pulsed again in the chamber's light, a grim reminder of the threats converging around her.
  </span>
 </p>

   </span>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Conference Room 3, No. 1 Zhongshan S Rd, Taipei, Taiwan, Imperium of Dragons territory
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Conference Room Three was designed for efficiency rather than beauty. Obsidian walls absorbed sound and light, creating an atmosphere of focused attention. The polished table at the center was a perfect hexagon, its surface reflecting the lights above.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur sat at the primary position, facing the door, her back to the alcove. In Imperial protocol, the highest-ranking official sat the furthest away from the entrance.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Iron Roach and Kaori entered together, taking positions to her left.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The center of the table hummed to life, projecting two translucent figures: Cheng Wei and Marisol. The holograms flickered slightly before stabilizing, both figures appearing seated despite being thousands of kilometers away.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Seneschal Cheng. Marisol." Dilinur acknowledged them with a slight nod. "Your report, please."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Cheng's hologram straightened, his military bearing evident even through the projection. "Prefect Altai, we regret to inform you that the retrieval of Unit U6-M9 has failed. We were ambushed by Directorate forces using a Scarab mech, with unexpected support from a Sand Lotus agent."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Sand Lotus priestess used Solar psionics. Significant combat capability," Marisol added. "Would you like to make a guess?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur's expression remained neutral. "Go ahead."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Female, Imperial phenotype, likely mid-thirties," Marisol replied. "White ballistic robes, carried a Spirit Lantern. Used Jǫturmál incantations."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Fuuka," Iron Roach interjected, his voice flat. "One of Thorin's acolytes. Heard she knows a few fancy Djinno spells, too? Like Dinu here."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Devavāṇī, is what it's called," Dilinur corrected.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Right, right, Deva-something. I knew that," Roach nodded awkwardly.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Continue," Dilinur said, looking at Cheng.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Cheng's holographic fingers clenched. "The Directorate pilot demonstrated exceptional skill with the Scarab, despite sustaining damage. Jabari Adomako, according to our intelligence. The android clearly recognized him."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Recognized?" Dilinur leaned forward slightly. "Elaborate."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The android called him by name," Marisol explained. "Showed emotional response. Attempted to reach him repeatedly during the extraction."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Jabari," Kaori supplied, checking a data pad from her sleeve. "Lieutenant Jabari Adomako, recent addition to the Kimaris Warband. Recruited at Fort Osu, Accra."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A silence fell over the conference room as the implications settled.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Directorate's involvement complicates matters," Dilinur observed. "Their interest in the android suggests they know about the data it contains."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "They had air support as well," Cheng added, his hologram shifting uncomfortably. "An Anioma jet. Pilot demonstrated unusually aggressive maneuvering patterns."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Wilhelm van der Merwe," Kaori supplied without looking up from her pad. "If any Directorate pilot was worth mentioning, it'd be him."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur's mind worked through the connections rapidly. "When you capture U6-M9, what measures did you implement to prevent data extraction?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Marisol's hologram flickered as she shifted position. "Standard protocols. Memory dampening field during transport. Neural inhibitor collar. But..." She hesitated.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "But?" Dilinur prompted.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The android appeared to be functioning normally despite the inhibitor. It should have reduced cognitive performance by 87%, yet it maintained full awareness and communication ability."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Iron Roach made a sound between a scoff and a growl. "Obviously modified. Your egghead must have tampered with its systems before fleeing."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Were you able to recover any data before losing the android?" Dilinur asked.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Cheng and Marisol's holograms exchanged a brief glance.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Partial," Cheng admitted. "Mary here established a connection for approximately seven seconds before system rejection. That was before the Directorate rescue team caught our movement."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Self-defense protocols at access level equivalent to a Trimetallic Firewall," Marisol elaborated. "Most Da-Ji units can be breached with standard Imperial override codes. This one fought back."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur's pulse quickened slightly, though her face showed nothing. "Show me the recovered data."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Marisol manipulated something off-hologram. A moment later, a third projection appeared above the table: fragmentary streams of code interspersed with geometric patterns that rotated in three dimensions.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The fragment is heavily encrypted," Marisol added. "Colonial cipher architecture with quantum overlays. Breaking it could take months. Fortunately, you have me."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Iron Roach leaned forward, his red sunglasses reflecting the holographic display as he read the words out loud. "Osram, Primal Urges, Vault, Ma-re can't-read-whatever-that-shit-is. Fuck me if this isn't related to the Moondust Crystal."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The Moondust Crystal remains our priority," Dilinur agreed. "But we must consider the possibility that the Directorate now has access to the same information."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "If they can decode it," Kaori pointed out, crossing her arms. "Directorate decryption capabilities lag behind ours by approximately eighteen months."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Who cares if they can break the code," Roach countered. "They get in our way, we blow them up the same."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur studied the fragmentary data floating above the table. "Where is the Directorate taking the android?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Unknown," Marisol replied. "They were extracted by an Isazi-class vessel. Atmospheric exit trajectory suggested Osram, but they could easily have changed course once beyond our tracking range."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur nodded once, her decision made. "We will not pursue the android immediately. Redirecting resources now would only alert the Directorate to the importance of what they've acquired."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "So, what will you tell Governor Qin?" Roach asked.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur met his hidden gaze steadily. "That we've identified new variables in the equation and are adjusting our strategy accordingly."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "The typical bureaucrat," Kaori observed, her tone suggesting she thought it foolish.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Both Cheng and Marisol's holograms tensed slightly at this. Neither spoke.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Your assignments are as follow until my meeting with the Governor," Dilinur continued. "Seneschal Cheng, return to Taiwan and await my command. Marisol, monitor outbound communications for any mention of android U6-M9 or unusual data processing requests."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The holograms nodded in acknowledgment.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Kaori, begin preparing the Draconic Engine. We'll need it if the Governor decides to send us off-planet."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Kaori inclined her head precisely. "Yes, Prefect."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur then turned to the cybernetically enhanced man beside her. "Have your Amber-Eyes coordinate surveillance on Alliance medical facilities. If Lorna Weiss is transforming as we suspect, they'll seek specialized treatment."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Iron Roach's artificial lips curved into something approaching a smile. "With pleasure."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "That concludes our meeting," Dilinur announced, rising from her seat. "Report any findings immediately, regardless of the hour."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The holograms flickered and vanished as Cheng and Marisol terminated their connections. Kaori rose, offering the precisely correct bow before exiting. Iron Roach lingered a moment longer, his posture casual.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Seems pretty stupid to me that we're fighting Directorate and Alliance all at once," he said, his mechanical voice lowered. "Maybe get some bargaining chip? Convince them brown folks to tag along somehow?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "If that ever becomes an option, we will reassess," Dilinur replied neutrally.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Roach nodded and departed, leaving Dilinur alone in the conference room. The hexagonal table now dark, reflecting nothing but the lights and her own solitary figure.
  </span>

  <span>
   Prefect's Study, No. 1 Zhongshan S Rd, Taipei, Taiwan, Imperium of Dragons territory
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Alone once more in her study, Dilinur retrieved her teacup from its heating pad. The bone china vessel appeared ordinary, but the circuitry embedded in its base maintained the jasmine tea at precisely 82 degrees Celsius—the optimal temperature for both flavor and medicinal properties.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She settled into her chair and activated the hidden surveillance system with a gesture. Holographic displays materialized before her, replaying the recent interactions from multiple angles. The Golden Serpents were unaware of this particular security measure—one installed at her own discretion, without the knowledge of even Governor Qin.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur studied the recordings with precision, focusing on subtle details most would overlook. Iron Roach's weight distribution as he leaned against the wall: a deliberate posture designed to appear casual while maintaining optimal balance for sudden movement. Kaori's precisely measured bow, the angle of her spine calculated to the exact degree required by protocol. The slight tension in Cheng's holographic shoulders when Governor Qin was mentioned.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Pause recording at time index 37:42," she instructed.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The playback froze, capturing Kaori mid-sentence. Dilinur examined the woman's expression—the minute tightening around her eyes, the almost imperceptible flare of her nostrils.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "She fears something," Dilinur murmured to herself, sipping her tea. "But not me."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   She resumed the playback, watching the subtle interplay of power and submission with renewed focus. The Golden Serpent Circle operated through layers of alliance and betrayal, each member positioning themselves through gestures as much as words.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Which of them, she wondered, might remain at her side if she ever ascended to true power? Roach was too self-serving, his loyalty extending only as far as his advantage. She hoped Kaori's resentment of Unblooded superior wouldn't run too deep for genuine friendship. Cheng showed potential, his military discipline valuing competence over bloodlines. Marisol remained an enigma, her motives obscured behind professional detachment.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur waved the recordings away and rose, teacup in her left hand. She approached the tall mirror mounted on the eastern wall of her study. With her right hand, she reached behind her head and carefully removed the ornate gold hairpin that held her formal updo in place. The pin and its blood-red gem clinked softly against the saucer as she set it down.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Her midnight black hair cascaded down, framing her jade white face and falling just past her shoulders. The Imperial uniform's high collar contrasted sharply with the delicate curves of her jawline. She studied her reflection, noting the subtle signs of strain that others would miss. The barely perceptible tightness at the corners of her eyes. The slight pallor beneath her carefully maintained complexion.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Then she saw it: a single strand of gray among the obsidian black, catching the light near her right temple. Evidence of stress no cosmetic could conceal, of emotions repressed beneath layers of control.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Governor Qin would see only failure in recent events. Skarn's escape, the android's loss, even Lorna Weiss's infection...all would be laid at her feet. As an Unblooded Prefect, she lacked the protection that blood status afforded others. His punishment would be...creative. Degrading. Designed to remind her of her place.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "When," she whispered to her reflection, "will I cease being a victim of my own fate?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Then, in the Genome Sequencer next to her, Skarn's tentacle pulsed in the amber fluid, the genetic material within still viable despite separation from its host. She set down her teacup and approached the device, a sudden idea crystallizing in her mind.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Sequencer," she said, her voice steady with new purpose, "is it possible to replicate the organism from this specimen? To grow it into a new life form?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The machine hummed, processing. "Theoretical possibility exists. Specimen contains sufficient genetic material for cloning procedures. However, anomalous sequences present unusual challenges."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Can you overcome those challenges?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Additional research required. Estimated time to definitive answer: 78 Earth days. Success probability cannot be calculated with available data."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur pressed her palm against the cool surface of the Sequencer. "And if you began now?"
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "A dedicated Tissue Culture Container would be required. Current facilities can accommodate the procedure, but resources would be diverted from other projects."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   A slight smile curved Dilinur's lips—not the practiced expression she showed to subordinates, but something genuine, touched with both ambition and wonder.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Begin immediately," she ordered. "Priority classification: Ruby. Authorization: Altai-9-7-3."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   "Acknowledged. Initializing Tissue Culture Container. Preparing specimen for cellular extraction."
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The machine's internal components shifted, creating a secondary chamber adjacent to the specimen display. Robotic arms no thicker than acupuncture needles extended toward the tentacle, preparing to harvest living cells for the cultivation process.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Dilinur watched the procedure commence, her reflection ghostlike on the Sequencer's glossy surface. If this succeeded—if she could grow a controlled specimen from Skarn's own tissue—perhaps failure could yet be transformed into unprecedented advancement. And should they secure the Moondust Crystal, her own position might evolve from precarious to essential.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Behind her, a notification chimed softly from her terminal. She turned, already knowing what she would find.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The message awaiting her bore Governor Qin's personal seal, its priority markers glowing crimson on the screen.
  </span>
