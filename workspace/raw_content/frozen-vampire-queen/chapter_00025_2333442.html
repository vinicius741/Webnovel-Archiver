<p align="left" class="cnM5OWFlNTM5ZmJlZDRhODU5YmY5ZmUzMDY2Yjk3NDli">“Strip your clothes.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM4MTgxMGIyNDFmOTRhMWNiNzUyYzZmOGU3ZjczMjc4">Emma looked at the dragon and blinked her eyes several times. She struggled to process the words that just left Lunaria’s lips.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNjMTU0MjhmM2M0MTRkMTk4MGVhNDJmMDExOTdiM2Rl">“Surely you don’t want me to give you a massage with your clothes on?” The dragon asked.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMyMjAwN2Q2YzI5ZjQ0MzlhMmVlZWJiMmQ5MWFhNzcz">Emma’s face burned a vivid red. Somehow she’d ended up alone with the evil dragon. Karlack pulled the others away with her, and now she was standing in an inn room. Asked to strip by a dragon right away. Emma’s heart beat in her chest, and she struggled to find words.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMwNGUzNWM1NDZjYzRkMzk4NjM4NjNjMTRiOTAwYzMz">The dragon gave her a knowing grin. “Relax, you don’t have to strip to get a massage. Just lay over there on that comfy bed.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMxYzBhZTNlY2QxNDRlYjA4M2NkNzg3YzExOGEwNGZm">Emma followed Lunaria’s finger and looked at the large bed. She didn’t remember the last time she ever slept in a bed. Had she even done so as a vampire? Emma already knew the answer to that. It was a tragic no. Her body had been made to endure all of the pains of the road.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMxMGRmMmJlMGZjMzQ0MmNhMmU1YjEwYmY5YmU0YTEw">Lunaria clutched onto Emma’s hand and lead her to the bed. “Don’t be stubborn. Lay on your stomach.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNhNTFmZmYwNDNiMDQ0MDlhN2VhMzc5OGQ4MWMzNTUy">“I didn’t think you were serious about the massage thing!”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM2ZjZkYTA1YWRjNTRlZDdiM2RkY2ZlM2E4ZTgzMDI4">“I was very serious. It’s important to take care of my possessions.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM3NDdhMDY0ZGFlMzRlMzU5YmY3Y2MwZWY0NDY5NTFj">“Your possessions?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM5ZjI2YWNiMDA5MzQ0ZWFhNzJhZTAyY2VjYzEzZWUy">The dragon quickly corrected herself as Emma lay on her stomach. “I meant in a wife kind of way. The way we possess each other, yes? Anyway, that doesn’t matter. Just lay on your stomach and close your eyes.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNhOTEzODg2MThlOTQ5YjZhNWM0ODkzNmE4ZWEwZWZj">“Don’t do anything weird, okay?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNjOWFiNTIzYmE3ZTRhYjZhZWQ1NDYzZTgzMDZhZmQw">Lunaria breathed a sigh. “What kind of a wife do you think I am? I would never do anything that doesn’t make you feel good. At least not intentionally...Or unless you asked for something like that...maybe.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM2YWUxNjFmMmY2OTQzZTk5NjAzOTZjNGIzMjg4NWZi">Before Emma could ask what the hell the girl was talking about, she felt the dragon climb on her back. Emma struggled to understand why she agreed to this so readily. She felt herself burning with embarrassment from the position. The dragon sat on her lower back and leaned forwards, whispering in Emma’s ear.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNmYjViYWU3ODQ2NTRjMGM4M2UxZDE0MDI2ZmU1ZTVl">“You don’t need to worry about anything anymore. As of right now, you will only concern yourself with paradise.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM1NGU1ZDlmYmJhOTRiMmU5NzYxZDdkMTM1MjBmYzUx">Emma felt the dragon’s two strong hands dig into her shoulders. Whatever answer Emma had for Lunaria died into a whimper. The two hands kneaded into her shoulders powerfully.</p><span class="cjA0OTQwNzkxMGFjMTQ2ZGU5NDNiNjA5YWU3YTJiOWU1"><br/>The author's narrative has been misappropriated; report any instances of this story on Amazon.<br/></span>
<p align="left" class="cnMzZDhiNzJkYTNmMTQ1MWRiYzBiMTQ0YzlmNThmNDEx">“You need to loosen up your body. All of the constant worrying that’s been plaguing your mind needs to be set free.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNkNWI5NGE0YmJhYzRlMmQ5YmZlNjhkNzlmZmU2MTc1">“My constant…”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNjOTBhMWVkOGY2MTRkZTNiNWVkNzhmYTI2Njg3ZGE4">Emma started to ask what she was talking about, but the hands caressing her dug in even more, rubbing out all of the tension in Emma’s shoulders. The vampire felt the hands slide down her arms and back up again, rubbing them gently but firmly.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMxZjQ2OGVhMTI0ODRiNzA4OGQwZmQ4NWY4YWNlYmJm">“Loosen your arms and let go of all of the pain. Aren’t you tired of constantly battling against the world?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM1YjgxM2U2ZTg1YjQyYjI4NzQzODlkZjcxNmYxODEx">Emma could not answer. She simply closed her eyes and let the dragon work. The vampire buried her face into the bed and tried to tune out all of the worries plaguing her.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM4MGMyNDRhMGZmOTRhZGViMzc3ZDZkNWRjNTY3ODk5">“Good girl,” the dragon said. Lunaria moved her hands back towards Emma’s upper back, and she began kneading it with her fingers. The dragon expertly dug her thumbs into all of the right places as she explored Emma’s back.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNhODcwYWQ3OWY3NDQxYzg4ZGYzNWM5NDk1ODg3Njcx">Slowly, Emma’s body was being drained of all tension. The dragon’s firm hands dug into her lower back, eventually arriving at Emma’s dimples of venus. She felt Lunaria dig into that spot, and her mind became filled with entirely new thoughts.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMwZGNmMDU3Y2I2OTQzMGJiYWFiNmE0M2Y5OTg0NGJl">Emma’s mind struggled against the reality of a gorgeous girl on her back. The dragon’s thick legs were pressed up against the side’s of Emma’s body, and Lunaria’s touch was so intimate and physical. A new tension was building inside of Emma like steady waves gradually becoming bigger.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM0NTIwZTc5OTZiNTQ1YjliYTY4NmVhOTdiNDAyOGEy">Lunaria pressed her chest against Emma’s back and leaned down to speak into the vampire’s ear. “How does this feel?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNiMGNlNGQ4NTlkZjRhOWJiNTk3YmNiMmNkOTBlYTk4">Emma’s body burned like never before. Her face was on fire, and she dared not to look up from the bed. She realized that every second spent in this sensual massage was detrimental to the vampire’s defenses. Lunaria’s breath fell to the back of Emma’s neck, and the dragon’s voice became huskier.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNmODliZTVlYmRjMTQ2ODg5YjU3NGY2YTIwNmZhYzdh">“When you look and sound like this, it makes me want to capture you even more.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM5YTljMmM1MTRhMzRiMDBhZmQwYWY2ZjdkZjA0ZmUy">Emma hadn’t even noticed the sound of her own small moans. The tension did drift away from her body, but that made the dragon’s hands even more pronounced. It lowered Emma’s defenses. Whatever barrier usually stopped her from making strange sounds had been broken, and the whole time she was letting out little moans or whimpers of pleasure.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnMxZWE3N2ZmMjEwOTRhNzk5OGEwNTMwMWY1NzkxMjI5">The dragon ran her tongue over Emma’s neck, causing the vampire to flinch and shiver. “This is me paying you back for earlier.”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNlOTIzYzk3YzI5YTRhMDk4MTFiYTRmZDMxYWQxZmUw">“This is crazy...What about Sora and Karlack?”</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM2ZjQ2OTkwMDc0NTQ5ZWU4Y2Q2NDE1OGMwZWNiNGZl">“What did I tell you? Right now, you aren’t worrying about anything else.” Lunaria climbed off for only a second before rolling Emma onto her back. Before the startled vampire could protest, Lunaria was on top of her again, facing her.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM3YjIyZDM0MjE5MDQxZDBhOGNjZGM5NWM1MTgxOTI2">Emma’s eyes darted around like crazy over the dragon’s face. Ultimately they fell towards the vixen’s lips.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM0ZGY4MTBjYjQyYzRhZWY4NjRhMjM2NzY4NmE5ZTYw">Lunaria noticed and stole Emma’s lips with her own before she could say anything. This kiss was far deeper than the ones before, and it lingered much longer. The dragon made no effort to hide her lust. She licked Emma’s lips and pushed her tongue inside.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnNiM2NkZGRkZmZhODRiM2Y4MGYzNjY4NDFhMWUzY2Iy">Emma had no idea how or why the other girl was experienced in these endeavors, but none of that mattered. She was losing to this kiss. Emma’s body acted in ways she couldn’t even predict.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM3YmY0N2NjYWE3YzQwN2Q5MGMxNzU0M2RmYTFmNjQ2">Her mind grew hazy with arousal, and she found her hands grabbing hard onto the bed sheets. Emma’s feet curled, and her legs squirmed, but the dragon’s weight made stuck.</p>
<p align="left" class="cnM4NGE3NTljNTZlYTRiYTNhMjY1YjcxOTY4NjlhMmEx">Lunaria pulled away with a smile and pressed a finger to Emma’s soft lips. “Next time, you will beg me to do this naked.”</p>
